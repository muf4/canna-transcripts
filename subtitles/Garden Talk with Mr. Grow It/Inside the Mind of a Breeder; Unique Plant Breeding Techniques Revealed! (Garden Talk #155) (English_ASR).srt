00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,759
can do in breeding reversing back

167
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,879
Crossing what do you do for like what

168
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,439
what's your style of breeding what do

169
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:26,159
you do so forgive me for not having all

170
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:30,360
the uh formal terms and whatnot but it

171
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,880
really just uh my initial

172
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,240
uh I guess Beginnings with the breeding

173
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,439
you know it started really with uh the

174
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:41,038
first one was midnight cush and it was

175
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:44,038
that was the name of the strin and um

176
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:46,839
then it was just a a random uh seed that

177
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:49,839
I had lying around and luckily it was a

178
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:51,519
male and you know from there I was just

179
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,198
I kind of just was crossing it with

180
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,560
different ones I you know visiting

181
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,720
various seed banks and whatnot and um

182
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,598
and just you know I was just just

183
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,720
crossing them you know until I got a

184
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:04,279
little bit further on you know uh I

185
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,039
became priview you know to some of your

186
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,918
content and everything and then I know

187
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:11,439
uh the pheno hunting the back Crossing

188
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:14,519
and some of those topics and whatnot um

189
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,439
and it was uh that was when I the first

190
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,079
time I implemented the back Crossing you

191
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,639
know when I was just looking to try to

192
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,598
like just kind of he like hone in on

193
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:27,759
some of the uh characteristics of pretty

194
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:30,199
much one in particular you know um but

195
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,520
yeah okay so you're mostly doing kind of

196
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,199
the inbreeding side of things you're

197
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:36,959
taking one from one side mother father

198
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,000
Crossing that and then are you working

199
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,239
yourself down generation to generation

200
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,439
or you kind of just sticking with the

201
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,158
f1s I really just been sticking with the

202
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:47,719
f1s at this current time um up to the

203
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:50,478
point so yeah and I'm currently feno

204
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,280
hunting right now um in this particular

205
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,279
stage where I'm at I've been uh pretty

206
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,359
much just crossing down up to the point

207
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:58,519
and uh like I said once I kind of back

208
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,680
cross cuz I I was running into some

209
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,399
issues with uh it was actually I had

210
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,120
some Hermes in there where it was

211
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,839
expressing that so obviously that's

212
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,680
going to be a issue for you know

213
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,158
depending on how you look at

214
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,000
things so uh we definitely was looking

215
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:17,598
to to get that out of there and the back

216
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,319
Crossing um it definitely seemed to be

217
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,639
the way to get it out you know it just

218
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:25,598
with the really just like the one time

219
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,199
and it was for the most part okay so how

220
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:28,639
did you do that back cross so you did

221
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,960
that initial cross right and The

222
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,799
Offspring of that you planted you

223
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,038
finding Herms and then you uh would you

224
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:38,319
take one that wasn't a Herm and kind of

225
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:41,479
back crossed it to the father or how did

226
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,879
you do that so what ended up happening

227
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:47,040
was my particular cross that I've been

228
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:50,000
working with it had some hermy jeans in

229
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:53,919
um so what ended up happening was I kind

230
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,200
of got lucky I had a forbidden fruit uh

231
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:59,599
and I got a female and a male now when I

232
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,120
got the male I saved the pollen you know

233
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,040
I you know put it in the bag froze it so

234
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,000
I was able to preserve it and pretty

235
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:09,599
much over time what I ended up doing was

236
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,679
after the initial cross you know I ended

237
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,360
up with the forbidden fruit um pollen

238
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:19,679
that I had I ended up Crossing that back

239
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,120
into the mix and that next

240
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,479
Offspring it appeared that the hermy you

241
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,560
know Gene that it was expressing

242
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,560
previously was pretty much Clear okay

243
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:30,958
talk to us about your favorite cross

244
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:33,439
that you've ever created first of all

245
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,278
how many crosses have you done roughly

246
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,760
and what's your favorite one I'd have to

247
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,519
say up to this point um it was one of

248
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,879
the ones I referenced to as a night

249
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,399
cheddar cuz after the initial Cross of

250
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,919
the midnight cush with the uh the Rando

251
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,799
SE that I just had lying around um I

252
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:52,599
ended up Crossing it with a a blue

253
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:55,439
cheese and um I just remember the the

254
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,240
turpine profile of it was it it was just

255
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,160
something very unique I I'll say that

256
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,360
and I wish I actually uh due to the fact

257
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:05,679
that it was so early on and uh you know

258
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,879
I had the seeds for quite some time I

259
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,879
never

260
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,639
really you know I wish I was more into

261
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:13,240
feno hunting back in the day that's all

262
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,078
I could say because I I definitely

263
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,639
missed that one you know by the time I

264
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:18,439
actually thought about it it was sitting

265
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,399
around I kind of was already jumping

266
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,040
down the strain of I got to cross this

267
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,759
one with that one I still don't have it

268
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:28,039
yet

269
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:29,759
um you know it ended up uh yeah when I

270
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:31,278
tried coming back around like later in

271
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,078
the years and whatnot cuz I just been

272
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:34,639
holding on to them the seeds were pretty

273
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:37,479
much I couldn't get any of them

274
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:41,000
germinate so it was uh null and void you

275
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:43,680
know oh damn so on that cross what was

276
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,559
like the flavors and smells and effects

277
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:49,239
that you got out of it it just felt like

278
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,759
uh how can I it was just very like

279
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,320
floaty you know nothing too crazy where

280
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:54,919
it's going to be like the couch lock

281
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,600
effect but you know if you got things to

282
00:10:54,919 --> 00:11:00,559
do you know it was still you know it

283
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,040
just was more so like a a even kill it

284
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,919
felt like a 5050 you know I've never

285
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,519
done any you know formal testing or

286
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:09,759
whatnot but just going off of like the

287
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,639
overall effects of it it was uh it was a

288
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:15,879
very like balanced kind of a effect that

289
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:19,120
you you know garnered from it um I felt

290
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:22,320
like it was like hints of the cheese you

291
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,399
know but there was also a remnants of

292
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,720
the midnight Kush which I was very fond

293
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,639
of it was um kind of gassy you know uh

294
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,079
it was elements of that it was just a

295
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,639
very nice blend from what I could

296
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:36,638
remember okay now are your genetics

297
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,159
available to the community or do you

298
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,879
just keep them internal no right now you

299
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:43,120
know it's all internal you know last

300
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,958
thing I want to do is put out some bad

301
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,959
uh you know genetics of any kind or

302
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,719
something that'll be uh cumbersome to

303
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:52,239
you know to work with you know I really

304
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,440
want to you know get it to a point where

305
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,839
it would be you know um it would be very

306
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,160
advantageous I would say for a new

307
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,639
beginner you know grower to come into it

308
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,519
and or or to a Conor sewer can also like

309
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,120
appreciate it you know

310
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:09,200
so it still has some work to be done for

311
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,639
sure for sure you know makes sense yeah

312
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,120
it can take so long to get through the

313
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:16,000
process I mean I started chill out OG

314
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:20,120
it's a the only cross I've actually ever

315
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
done in 2019 so started and I released

316
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,278
to the community in 2023 it took me kind

317
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,839
of several years in order to kind of

318
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:31,639
really confident that what I had was

319
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:34,440
going to be stable enough to we really

320
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:37,879
weren't going to find any Herms or say

321
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:40,440
many I would to say none because like

322
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:42,320
from my understanding it's still kind of

323
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,880
always within its genetics no matter

324
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,120
what I know some people will debate that

325
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,720
fact but for the most part what I was

326
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,039
Finding in the population I wasn't

327
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,320
really finding any hermaphrodite plants

328
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,240
so got to the point where I was

329
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,959
comfortable to actually do the release

330
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,600
but yeah it takes very very long time so

331
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,439
uh you you got to have patience for it

332
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,120
you know I know some people will just

333
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,480
pollen Chuck and then they'll create

334
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,440
seeds and then push it out to the

335
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,720
community without testing that's a

336
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,920
separate conversation but yeah it seems

337
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,720
like you're going about it the right

338
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:12,039
ethical way to where you haven't even

339
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,560
released anything yet you're just kind

340
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:16,480
of working things so it's good to hear

341
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,239
definitely definitely you know uh I

342
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,720
think also too after watching some of

343
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,278
the content and listening in on on some

344
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,480
of the discussions I was like I'm going

345
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:27,320
get ridiculed I I can't I can't have

346
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,879
myself out there like that you know so

347
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,440
there a lot of pressure you know what I

348
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,720
mean it's it's like if you if you

349
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,120
release something there's just a bunch

350
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,839
of Herms I mean look what happened to

351
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,879
Humbolt seed company they released the

352
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:43,959
donuts triploid and it's like a really

353
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:46,480
really high percentage of Herms and it

354
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:48,759
they got exposed and it was just not a

355
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,800
good thing for them and I don't I don't

356
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:53,278
think they're selling them anymore their

357
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,359
listing is still up but it was a

358
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,838
catastrophe and uh yeah that's

359
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,240
apparently there wasn't enough testing

360
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,880
done yes they we just doing it Outdoors

361
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,320
once they got to indoors that's like I

362
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:06,278
guess where a lot of those problems were

363
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,160
happening yeah which that's interesting

364
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:10,039
you know that environmental change you

365
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,879
know can definitely impact a lot of

366
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:13,599
things for sure oh for sure yeah

367
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:15,120
absolutely but yeah it's good that

368
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,959
you're patient with things it's good to

369
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,320
here now when you are doing pheno

370
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,679
hunting right when you're looking for

371
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,680
that male when you're looking for that

372
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,679
female there are different

373
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,000
characteristics that you can look for

374
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,758
talking about males in particular what

375
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,559
do you typically look for when searching

376
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,278
for males to breed with

377
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:34,958
so I mean the biggest thing is how fast

378
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:38,240
is it growing how well does it adapt to

379
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:40,278
my environment right you know um and

380
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,959
also too one thing I've implemented as

381
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:46,000
of late I feel that uh more so a more

382
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:48,359
mature male plant at least from my own

383
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,240
experience doing the stem rub you know

384
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,519
just to see the tarpine because I feel

385
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,000
like that adds to the experience and

386
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,240
that's one of the things I feel like

387
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,360
when feno hunting just in general you

388
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,560
know is just looking for that that tur

389
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,720
profile that you know that essence you

390
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,719
know I feel like that's why you know

391
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,920
people burn incense you know that that

392
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,040
experience is everything you know um

393
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,838
well at least a big part of it um

394
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,439
obviously the flavor but you can't tell

395
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,839
that right there from the mail you know

396
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,720
but as far as the mail goes yeah that's

397
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,880
the biggest things you know growth

398
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,079
factors how well it thrives in my

399
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,919
environment because that's where I'm

400
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,559
going be growing it predominantly and

401
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:26,879
yeah you know the smell that I'm getting

402
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,719
from it if any and then how about female

403
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,519
plants do you look for kind of the same

404
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,160
thing are there other characteristics

405
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:34,000
that you look for when searching for

406
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,600
female plants to breed with so with the

407
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,360
females is more so I'd say like Midway

408
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,440
through you know I'm kind of looking for

409
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,039
certain things once again the smell that

410
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,600
is putting out uh the flower development

411
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:47,958
you know the node separation all those

412
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,920
things um

413
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:53,039
also the fan Leaf production as of

414
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:55,639
recent you know it's been a big thing

415
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,679
that I've been experiencing you know

416
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:00,399
just with implementing certain strains

417
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:02,078
into the cross it kind of like I don't I

418
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,480
don't know if it would be a mutation or

419
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,239
it's just a overabundance of that Gene

420
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,519
or whatever you know I can't say you

421
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,919
know but uh I know that's huge because

422
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:12,919
if you don't want to defoliate you know

423
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:15,278
three four times throughout the process

424
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:17,120
maybe five six you know uh some of them

425
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:19,039
you're just crazy with family production

426
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,039
and that could be a hindrance for some

427
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:21,679
that's interesting yeah so the

428
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:23,399
morphology of the plant you're looking

429
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,799
real deep into that and kind of

430
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,360
selecting from there huh yeah you know

431
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:29,679
all those characteristics you know for

432
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,600
the most part and you know at that point

433
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:35,318
you know like Midway through at least it

434
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,278
would be you know if you're looking to

435
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:40,679
um breed and whatnot and have something

436
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:43,799
available clone it if it looks anywh you

437
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:45,439
know um of something you know uh desire

438
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:48,919
characteristics that I'm seing and then

439
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,759
from there uh you know obviously the

440
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:54,078
effect that you know I would get from it

441
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:56,039
you know um upon Harvest but which is

442
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:57,919
why it's definitely you know you want to

443
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:59,958
clone it you know Midway through if it's

444
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,719
even looking of such and obviously you

445
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:03,000
got the triom production and things of

446
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,959
that nature because if you're looking

447
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
for like extracts and whatnot um I've

448
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,679
come across you know some interesting

449
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,480
you know strains out there where I've

450
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,919
seen just looking under the jeweler's

451
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,880
Loop the Tricom production is very

452
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,480
interesting you know it's just uh some

453
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,360
are far more prevalent than others you

454
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,120
know like I've seen them where they're

455
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:24,038
looking like they're almost like stacked

456
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:26,119
on top of each other it's it's pretty

457
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:27,879
wild you mentioned Midway through you

458
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,719
take clones are you talking Midway

459
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,360
through veg period period or are you

460
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,679
going into flower and uh taking clones

461
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:37,240
dur the flower stage yeah meaning the

462
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,720
actual flower stage you know um in

463
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,359
regards to the female plant you know uh

464
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,839
cuz I know when we speak on seeking

465
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:47,759
characteristics for me you know uh as

466
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,279
far as a female is concerned you know

467
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,160
that's when we're going to see like what

468
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:56,038
we're really getting granted structure

469
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:58,080
and whatnot um but you know the plan

470
00:17:56,038 --> 00:18:00,359
itself can always be manipulated you

471
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:03,399
know to the growth space you know using

472
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:05,399
various techniques and whatnot so you

473
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,480
know that's really not a big thing for

474
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,360
me I'm just I'm really seeking the

475
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,038
overall effect

476
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:16,240
um and you know really once again

477
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:19,000
adaptability to the environment you know

478
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,640
um some are far more heavier feeders

479
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,440
than others you know and whatnot and

480
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,840
then I sometimes I I do like to maybe

481
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,200
grow one or

482
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:29,000
two at least two you know different

483
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,480
strains throughout so that way when I

484
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,640
harvest you know I could have a

485
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,919
different selection and whatnot cuz you

486
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,320
know you could kind of get used to uh

487
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:39,640
one plant you know so it's nice for a

488
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:41,240
change up got it so you're doing what a

489
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,159
lot of people call monster cropping

490
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,319
where you're basically just taking a

491
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:47,440
clone and flower bringing it back

492
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:49,558
revegging it and then kind of working

493
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,519
with from there that makes sense i' I've

494
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:53,200
been doing that recently and I've had

495
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,960
pasts where I was taking clones within

496
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,720
the veg stage and yeah I mean you can

497
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,440
argue that it takes a little bit longer

498
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,640
to go through the Rev process but a

499
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,038
letot people have the time you know if

500
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,880
you're working the plants and finishing

501
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:06,599
off the flowering stage you can bring

502
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,960
that back and by the time you finish

503
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:10,079
that Harvest well it's already reving

504
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,880
and you're kind of working on it there

505
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,759
so timing I think is kind of important

506
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,120
when it comes to on that Avenue yeah for

507
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:19,400
sure you know I I think uh there's been

508
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:22,798
times where I've seen a plant and maybe

509
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:25,559
I I'll go ahead and you know

510
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:27,359
um kind of been let down and whatnot you

511
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:28,759
know hey it smells good and everything

512
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,199
like that and it's like oh we need this

513
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:32,079
this and then by the time we get to

514
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,880
actually experiencing the effects of it

515
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:36,439
it's very underwhelming and it was just

516
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,080
like ah you know

517
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,558
so it like you said very timec consuming

518
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,199
you know when going through the process

519
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,519
I think sometimes I could be overly

520
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,159
patient but hey you know yeah I guess

521
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:50,279
you can't rush perfection right all

522
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:52,679
right let's get deeper into the actual

523
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:56,240
growing process when you're breeding so

524
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,400
when you are breeding are you in soil

525
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,720
cocoa

526
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,480
Hydroponics well soil it's a bit of a

527
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,200
mixture I know I probably get ridiculed

528
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,120
for this cuz I've seen um different

529
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,519
sides of it but I'm kind of using I

530
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:11,079
guess it would be a bit of a three-part

531
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:13,158
you know it's already a premixed soil um

532
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:15,038
I just recently added like some cocoa in

533
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:17,240
it so I I kind of like broke it down and

534
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,679
then I have perlite

535
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,440
where I don't know if it would still be

536
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,880
defined as soil lless or whatever I know

537
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,000
some people have reference uh to it as

538
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,039
but um that's just my thing it's just

539
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,640
like the three-part you know it's very

540
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:34,000
light you know adding the extra cocoa in

541
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,200
as well with the perite

542
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,759
um so yeah but yeah soil nonetheless I

543
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,880
know I'm getting into specifics and

544
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:43,119
whatnot oh let's get into specifics so

545
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,039
what was it like a brand of bagged soil

546
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,079
that you mix with the cocoa and what's

547
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:50,839
the ratio between soil and cocoa and

548
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:53,119
prite so I would just say it's um just a

549
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:55,199
three-part you know so one part soil one

550
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:59,918
part cocoa and then one part

551
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:02,558
perlite um the what is it I want to say

552
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,038
it's uh Earth's forest or Earth's floor

553
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:05,639
something like that it's the green bag

554
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:08,400
that I think you could probably find in

555
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,038
every you know uh Garden store you know

556
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,798
that's uh in your local neighborhood so

557
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:16,519
yeah okay so one to one to one and then

558
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:18,558
what do you use for nutrients throughout

559
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:19,759
the growth cycle and how do you go about

560
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,278
those feedings throughout the growth

561
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:25,038
cycle do we have to name uh we talking

562
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:26,558
name brands or we just talking yeah you

563
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,319
talk Brands that' be helpful because the

564
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,720
the folks do like to have the details

565
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,359
now you don't want to reveal anything by

566
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,839
all means you don't have to buty it's

567
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,599
more so cuz I I feel like I'm going to

568
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,158
get lit up in the comments with it but I

569
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:40,000
use I use General Hydroponics honestly

570
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,240
because it's the most uh cost effective

571
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,839
but um I really just use their base veg

572
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:50,159
uh you know for veg I add the the silica

573
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:52,399
I also supplement the cow mag the micro

574
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,880
um and then I also uh throw some sugars

575
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,320
in there um I forget the name of it but

576
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,720
it's pretty much at the end of the day

577
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:01,678
it's like like a cane sugar base along

578
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,679
with some black strap molasses and you

579
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,720
know the basic stuff you know try to

580
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,679
keep it basic little bit of micro rising

581
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,278
in there throughout the process and just

582
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:11,798
to keep it going so I assume you're

583
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:13,720
following the General Hydroponics

584
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:15,200
feeding chart are you doing the full

585
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,558
dose according to what it says on the

586
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,080
chart are you doing half dose or or what

587
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:20,918
you know in all honesty I couldn't tell

588
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:23,199
you what it says I know I I just used

589
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:25,360
the five milliliters you know uh of

590
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,960
every single one that I use I throw it

591
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,918
together I do it all together you know

592
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,600
so I call it the uh I think we call it

593
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,840
the swamp juice if I'm not mistaken me

594
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:36,000
and my buddy but uh you know um yeah it

595
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,599
just mix it all together you know 5 MLS

596
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,919
each and then is every other you know uh

597
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:43,119
every other feeding so pretty much give

598
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:45,600
it the noes one water it with just some

599
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:49,319
sugar and then repeat are you doing the

600
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:51,879
same type of ratios for plants that

601
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:54,798
you're growing for flower production for

602
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,760
example versus a run where you're

603
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:59,240
creating seeds I know some people what

604
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:01,400
they do is they'll just stay on that V

605
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,200
ratio while they're creating seeds for

606
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,679
the entire run for the whole flowering

607
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,400
period and then they swear that that

608
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,240
helps with healthier seeds just

609
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,080
wondering if you did that technique or

610
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,038
did you just stick with what the feeding

611
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:15,918
chart says for most flowering uh Parts

612
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:18,158
where it basically knocks down the

613
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,240
nitrogen and increases the phosphorus of

614
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,720
potassium so yeah um when it when we

615
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,480
switch over to flour it's pretty much

616
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,278
obviously I'm not feeding it the the veg

617
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,038
NES at that point which is pretty much

618
00:23:27,278 --> 00:23:31,720
you know high in nitrogen and everything

619
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:34,798
I switch to the flower base and that's

620
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,278
the the major thing that I I use um I

621
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,720
guess the major difference that's it

622
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:41,519
everything else is pretty much the same

623
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,960
um and you know there will be at some

624
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:46,400
point I'll say

625
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,319
roughly maybe six to 7even weeks I might

626
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,798
up the dosing of the phosphorus you know

627
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:53,759
which is pretty much the flower base you

628
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:56,200
know instead of from 5 MLS to 10 um and

629
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,879
then I'd say it's usually about you know

630
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,519
two weeks about a week and a half at

631
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,760
that point I I'll just switch to pretty

632
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,599
much you know the water and sugar you

633
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:07,480
know and um that's pretty much it I I've

634
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:09,599
never really done anything known have I

635
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,319
known for that to I guess uh help with

636
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,158
any healthier seeds or anything like

637
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:16,158
that I've always just tried to keep it

638
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:18,520
as basic as possible and uh and repeat

639
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,440
you know and if I do try something it's

640
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:22,278
always maybe a little bit here a little

641
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,759
bit there instead of just diving into it

642
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:27,319
need you know got it yeah I've mostly

643
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:29,480
just been doing when I have a seated run

644
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:32,278
a breeding run where have crossed a male

645
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,759
and a female or pollinated a female and

646
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:36,000
it's creating seeds I have mostly just

647
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:37,640
been falling the feeding show where it

648
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,919
does kind of you know when you get into

649
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,559
flowering it's reducing the nitrogen

650
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,679
increasing the phosphorus and potassium

651
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:47,240
but this run in particular actually

652
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:50,360
working on F4 generation of chill OG and

653
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,038
this run I am kind of sticking with the

654
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:53,719
what it says for week one flower where

655
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:55,558
it kind of knocks back the nitrogen but

656
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,440
not as much as it does later on in

657
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:59,558
flowering and I'm just sticking with

658
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,240
that for the entire power in stage and

659
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:04,079
so far so good I mean I've got a couple

660
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:07,480
weeks left here until I harvest and the

661
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:10,119
true telling will be once I dry and then

662
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,599
crumble up the flowers and see what does

663
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:12,879
the seeds look like are there any

664
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:14,719
underdeveloped seeds what's the

665
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,278
percentage of developed seeds versus

666
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,319
Under underdeveloped seeds so on and so

667
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:20,919
forth so yeah I'm personally doing a

668
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:23,119
little little experimenting there when

669
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:25,520
it comes to uh the nutrients and and how

670
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:29,359
I do my feedings so let me ask you

671
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:31,918
something had do you find when you have

672
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:35,719
a plant that has seeds in it it takes

673
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,600
longer to mature or does uh does that

674
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,120
affect anything for you as far as the

675
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:42,038
development time 100% yeah I push it

676
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:45,000
further in order to try to get more

677
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:48,119
seeds developed so like right now I

678
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,119
could if I was just growing the females

679
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:51,519
and just harvesting the buds I'd be

680
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:53,918
harvesting them right now but I'm going

681
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,879
to push it additional weeks in order to

682
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,320
try to get more seeds out of it so I am

683
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,320
starting to see the fade on the plant

684
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:00,960
like normal normal Essence that happens

685
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:02,639
towards the end of the grow cycle I'm

686
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,640
keeping a close aisle for nanners to

687
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,720
potentially pop out nothing so far but

688
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,080
uh yeah I push it a couple more weeks in

689
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,038
order to try to get more more yield of

690
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,798
seeds out of it I think a lot of folks

691
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:15,480
do that and I I think it's a smart way

692
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:17,679
to go about it just got to keep an eye

693
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,640
on making sure like the seeds will drop

694
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,840
off the plant right so like it continues

695
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,960
to grow and KX open up and then the

696
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,558
seeds drop so if you have a whole bunch

697
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,120
of plants in the same grow space all the

698
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:30,480
seeds are dropping you might get mixed

699
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:31,839
up on what's what so you don't want to

700
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,960
go too long because you're going to have

701
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:35,158
all these seeds all over the floor but

702
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,360
uh yeah I definitely push it a little

703
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,159
bit longer than uh than I normally would

704
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,000
with just a a female plant that hasn't

705
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:43,840
been pollinated okay yeah I'm just

706
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,880
curious let's get into Precision stress

707
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,359
techniques so a lot of people will do

708
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,880
things to stress the plant in order to

709
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:51,719
try to get a better result do you do any

710
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,640
Precision stress techniques specifically

711
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:57,319
when breeding or fenal hunting so I've

712
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,840
done a lot over uh the years you know

713
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:02,038
just trying different uh techniques I

714
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:05,079
guess you would say you know everything

715
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:06,879
from almost impaling a pencil you know

716
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:09,480
into the base of it you know where it

717
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,278
splits it out and um you know cuz it's

718
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,360
supposed to create more Tri cone

719
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:16,759
production and everything else um

720
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:18,398
amongst uh many of other just different

721
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:19,879
things you know that they put out there

722
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,319
I I feel like we've all gone through

723
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:25,720
that but um the one the base that I

724
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:28,960
stick to is topping and LST I keep it

725
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,880
basic I like the top relatively early

726
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,840
um to allow you know

727
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,720
those the uh stems that is Created from

728
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:39,038
the topping you know to really develop

729
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,640
you know and you know to have a a base

730
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:44,879
that can pretty much hold up some heavy

731
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:48,759
uh flowers you know um but yeah and then

732
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,120
I also like in regards to the LS which

733
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:53,038
is there's so many ways to go about it

734
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,719
and it really just depends on like the

735
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,359
growth space and whatnot you know in

736
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:01,240
particular I like to kind of create the

737
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:04,479
branched out of effect where uh you know

738
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:07,519
you and then it kind of grows up

739
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,798
um the more tops the more yield I'm

740
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,200
definitely a yield guy I like to uh get

741
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:13,960
the most out of the Harvest understood

742
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,440
and then within the gross space there

743
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,798
different environment conditions that

744
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,960
you can aim for temperature relative

745
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:22,759
humidity some people supplement CO2 can

746
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,319
you talk to us about what environment

747
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:27,440
conditions that you aim for when

748
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:30,960
breeding so I definitely so when

749
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:34,000
breeding um I would treat it just as any

750
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,798
other uh flowering portion of the uh of

751
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,640
the grow time um you know I like to keep

752
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:41,679
it you know in between in between the

753
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,320
spectrum of like 55 you know 60 right

754
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,480
there I feel like that's the sweet spot

755
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:50,079
for me at least um and then as far as

756
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:53,599
temperature you know I in between 60 and

757
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:56,480
70 is is kind of a peak you know um I'm

758
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:58,599
one that I'm a fan of the purple color

759
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,038
and you know so I I was just like to see

760
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:02,119
what the plant does in the cooler

761
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:04,158
temperatures you know it's always uh

762
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:07,079
pretty interesting got it so pretty

763
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,120
straightforward there now when breeding

764
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:12,639
there so many different Expressions that

765
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:14,079
you can see amongst the plants mutations

766
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,038
happen every now and then right have you

767
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:18,678
come across any mutations when breeding

768
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:22,158
what would you refer to as a a mutation

769
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:25,080
anything from like Duck's foot or uh to

770
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,679
long list of ones albino plants uh

771
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:29,480
anything like that any funky growth that

772
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:31,919
you seen could be Twisted leaves

773
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,240
anything like that at all or no uh you

774
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,519
know I can't say so much mutations like

775
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,440
that the the only thing I would

776
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:42,000
reference to I guess would be close to a

777
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:45,200
mutation is a plant that grows like it's

778
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,519
been topped just by itself it doesn't

779
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:51,600
stick to the um the normal I guess

780
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:54,079
Christmas tree you know type look it's

781
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:58,158
it it's very branchy almost like if you

782
00:29:54,079 --> 00:30:00,000
were to flip a a grape you know like a a

783
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,399
The Grapes pretty much upside down and

784
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,038
how that would look you know it it does

785
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,918
something along those very very weird

786
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:08,839
you know but yeah I that would be the

787
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:11,120
the closest to a mutation I would I

788
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:12,918
would say I've seen yeah I I call that

789
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:14,439
self topping how it's like it just kind

790
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:16,278
of splits off into two different

791
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,278
directions without you even even doing

792
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:22,119
the topping right yeah and I I feel some

793
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:24,480
of that is induced with the LST method

794
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:26,719
when you kind of expose the lower

795
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,120
branches where they normally wouldn't

796
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,519
get I guess they wouldn't normally

797
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:34,199
develop as they would you know um if it

798
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:39,200
you just let it do what it would do by

799
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:41,480
itself so some of it may be you know uh

800
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,278
my own doing I guess to some extent but

801
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,278
like I said some of them that I have

802
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:49,119
seen some plants that just grow like

803
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:51,759
that um yeah one in particular I want to

804
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:54,439
say it is uh might be from Herby seeds

805
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:57,319
if I'm not mistaken it's the uh Apple

806
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,480
betties and the runs punch I want to say

807
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:01,519
I seen kind of that's at least what I

808
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,360
experienced from it it was it was

809
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:06,679
interesting cool I had to pull up the

810
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:10,719
list here of potential mutations we've

811
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:15,919
got poly Ploy stringy Australian bastard

812
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:18,120
or ABC uh there is vinik there's creeper

813
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,360
phenotype Ducks foot I already mentioned

814
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:23,079
Leaf buds we have buds actually that are

815
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,719
on the pedal between the pedial and the

816
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:29,158
actual Leaf albino which I talked about

817
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:31,120
Ford phot taxi that's the quick list of

818
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:32,200
mutations and there's also that double

819
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:33,439
seedling I don't know if you've ever

820
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,159
come across I've seen some people come

821
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,038
across it where they plant a seed and

822
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:39,440
then two Sprout out I thought that was

823
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:41,879
pretty cool I can't say that I've

824
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:45,038
experienced that but the uh the butt in

825
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,760
between the leaves you know that sounds

826
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:49,319
interesting like I think that would just

827
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:50,638
be cool to see I don't know yeah yeah I

828
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:52,240
actually haven't come across that yet

829
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:54,278
but I'm waiting I'm waiting I wonder

830
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,519
what the odds are to come across that

831
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:57,960
maybe I don't know one in 10,000 or

832
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:00,278
something I don't even know what those

833
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,319
that would be if anybody knows comment

834
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:06,079
below man please please let me know hey

835
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:07,519
and take a picture take a picture so

836
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:09,558
there are many challenges that you could

837
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,880
come across when breeding what are some

838
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:14,119
common challenges that you Face

839
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,559
Time um

840
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:20,000
knowledge uh you know when I started it

841
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:22,599
was a very uh I guess primitive concept

842
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,119
of uh just growing in general let alone

843
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:28,558
breeding you know given the information

844
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:30,518
that was available to me uh versus uh

845
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:32,319
you know where we're at now you know

846
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:33,839
it's so readily available I'm kind of

847
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:35,638
jealous of all the new Growers getting

848
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:37,638
into the game you know they just got all

849
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:42,759
this is just it's just there for him you

850
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:44,719
know um but yeah um but as far as uh

851
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:46,319
yeah so a lot of it is just you know

852
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,720
knowledge and everything so that those

853
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:53,519
are some of my own uh personal obstacles

854
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,200
um not making the most of each of each

855
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,038
grow you know and that just kind of

856
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,240
falls into the knowledge right not

857
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:03,038
knowing up until I'd say about uh 3 4

858
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,759
years ago just feno hunting right that's

859
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:05,919
when it finally dawned on me I was like

860
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:09,398
whoa so that

861
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,720
means what I found to be underwhelming

862
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:15,278
the one or two seeds that I grew out of

863
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:17,079
the batch and was like uh this is all

864
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:19,079
right you know I could have had

865
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:22,638
something amazing in that batch you know

866
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:27,240
cuz now knowing like okay a F1 versus a

867
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:28,918
F3 um man and also too when you're

868
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,278
implementing certain

869
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:33,600
genetics even with just the seed banks

870
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:37,480
I'm seeing some now put this in like the

871
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:40,278
listings but actually putting F1 F2

872
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,000
F3 um which I I really love you know

873
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:43,798
just the transparency because that could

874
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,480
help with making a decision you know

875
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:49,558
just with uh I guess uh limiting the

876
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,720
variables of of what you may get you

877
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:54,599
know um especially when you're seeking a

878
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,759
particular like trait from what they're

879
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:58,480
uh you know putting in the description

880
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:01,839
of that particular

881
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,759
so um man it's it's so many I could I

882
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:05,759
could ramble on all day for as far as

883
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:08,480
obstacles that you may come across as

884
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:09,679
breeding you know because this yeah it's

885
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,119
been a long

886
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,679
one yeah it's crazy how many different

887
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:16,480
phenotypes you can find within a batch

888
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,280
of seeds how many different Expressions

889
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,280
you can find and I think the fenal

890
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,720
hunting part is real fun and you

891
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,639
mentioned kind of knowledge is being a

892
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,519
uh challenge that you face I think with

893
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,838
breeding in particular there's so much

894
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:30,358
to know and sure there's some

895
00:34:28,838 --> 00:34:32,679
information on the internet right you

896
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:35,559
can just do Google searches and and

897
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,599
learn how to do breeding there and learn

898
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:38,119
the different terms and different ways

899
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:40,838
to go about and stuff like that but it

900
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:42,280
might be valuable to purchase a book you

901
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:44,199
know there are many books out there I

902
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,839
just bought the one by James loud he has

903
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:48,838
one on breeding and uh that's been my

904
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:50,599
go-to as of right now anything that cuz

905
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:53,039
he just released it I think this year

906
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:54,838
maybe 2024 or maybe he released in 2023

907
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,679
but I just got my hands on it this year

908
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:59,119
very detailed book and you know you can

909
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:01,160
just easily get to it and I can just go

910
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,400
over my bookshelf there pick it out and

911
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:06,199
then go back to the index if I'm looking

912
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:09,320
for something in particular or look by

913
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:11,639
chapter and uh learn so much it's I

914
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,559
really recommend folks dig into some of

915
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:14,838
these books that are out there because

916
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:16,440
again sure you can go ahead and do

917
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:18,320
Google searches on the internet but

918
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,400
unfortunately there's a lot of mixed

919
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,519
information M

920
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,160
misinformation it can be tougher a

921
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:26,838
little bit tougher to navigate in my

922
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:29,279
opinion so yeah I can totally see how

923
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:31,519
the knowledge can be a barrier and I'm

924
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,880
glad you brought that one up oh yeah now

925
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:34,920
how about common

926
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,280
misconceptions about breeding what are

927
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,680
some things that you feel like people

928
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,480
say is one thing but it's actually a

929
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:44,559
misconception oh wow man that kind of

930
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,320
Falls uh into the knowledge portion of

931
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:49,159
it which I mean hey the Mis I one of the

932
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,680
things that it was a misconception for

933
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:55,920
me was hey you take this OG and mix it

934
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:57,759
with this sherb over here and uh the

935
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,559
first uh you know one you try is going

936
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,760
to be amazing cuz you had two amazing

937
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:05,000
plants and it's still a journey from

938
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:10,720
there you know um so that right there

939
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I'd say one for sure um and wow you know

940
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:14,879
what may grow good in your environment

941
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,400
may not be suitable from you know for

942
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,079
someone else's you know

943
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,800
uh the region that you're in you may it

944
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:26,920
may be more humidity or lack thereof you

945
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,640
know so um while this plant May Thrive

946
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,519
the cooler temperatures at night you

947
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:33,639
know um and some plants is is not going

948
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,960
to uh happen I've had some while you

949
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:38,559
know just testing out genetics and

950
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,240
whatnot some thrived you know in the

951
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:41,719
cool like the colder temperatures and it

952
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,838
just did some cool things you know with

953
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:48,719
the colors and whatnot right but then

954
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:50,279
others the the harvest or or you know I

955
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,239
guess if I could even call the Harvest

956
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,720
you know it was underdeveloped flour and

957
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:56,919
everything else that you know you were

958
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:59,318
dealing with so um yeah those are some

959
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:02,000
good ones let's talk about the future of

960
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:04,239
breeding what trends do you see in the

961
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,838
future and how might advances in

962
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:12,279
genetics and Technology shape the next

963
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:15,799
generation of strains oh man um you know

964
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,519
I say first of all is uh definitely the

965
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,680
the transparency and the things that's

966
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:22,519
just out there right now um is going to

967
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:25,159
help with everything you know um people

968
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:27,358
that are aspiring you know that aspiring

969
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,879
breeders and and may have like a goal in

970
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:32,000
mind mind that they want to do I think

971
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,240
that that's huge um but as far as on the

972
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,719
technology

973
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:37,000
level I I which I'd have to imagine

974
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:39,598
they're already doing some of these

975
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,639
things I mean I I've never worn a lab

976
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,480
coat you know or whatnot but I know you

977
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:45,239
know just from seeing how they cross the

978
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,719
plants and just the vegetables that we

979
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:49,318
have every day you know um and really

980
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:51,959
being able to hone in and just

981
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:53,480
manipulate things like um I'd have to

982
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,240
say like maybe to the point with a

983
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,079
crisper if you're familiar with that

984
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:59,799
like some of that technology I mean if

985
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:02,720
they're you know able to hone in on

986
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,680
certain genes you know within us I mean

987
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:06,159
obviously they could do it with the

988
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:09,598
plants I know they can and if you have

989
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:11,199
Precision technology like that uh you

990
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,440
know you could do some amazing things I

991
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:18,118
mean I'd have to say the uh the future

992
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:20,358
is really is kind of endless you know um

993
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:21,920
yeah or the possibility yeah I think

994
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:24,119
there's going to be a lot of changes in

995
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,760
the future for breeding I mean tissue

996
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:27,000
culture that's becoming more and more

997
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,040
popular it's becoming more and more

998
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,239
accessible

999
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:32,519
to the hom Growers I know Athena put out

1000
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,719
that tissue culture kit I haven't had a

1001
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:36,920
chance to try it myself but seems like

1002
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:39,039
it makes things a lot more easier for

1003
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,119
small home Growers individuals to do

1004
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:43,800
tissue culture and I foresee people

1005
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,119
using that to kind of store genetics I

1006
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,640
think also uh testing will kind of be

1007
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:51,680
get a lot better in the future being

1008
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:54,440
able to test for resistance pathogens

1009
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:56,279
diseases so on and so forth I think

1010
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,318
that's going to be big in the future but

1011
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,839
yeah we'll see I mean it's it's kind of

1012
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:03,279
hard to imagine the whole crisper thing

1013
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:05,440
is nuts I've seen a few documentaries on

1014
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,680
it and seeing what they're doing with

1015
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,880
like humans you know and how there was

1016
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,279
somebody in China who who did it for a

1017
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,079
birth or something like that and I was

1018
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,359
like what the heck yeah yeah it's wild

1019
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,039
to see what the future is like for that

1020
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:20,119
and how that translates over to the

1021
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:22,159
plant side of things yeah I think they

1022
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:24,200
reference to them as designer babies you

1023
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:26,519
know so uh I'm sure they got designer

1024
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:29,358
plants for sure you know it's going down

1025
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:30,639
um I mean yeah it's just it's it's

1026
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:32,679
really interesting I think some of the

1027
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,879
things that you touched on I know uh

1028
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:37,919
just the technology I I think being

1029
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,599
readily available to the hom grower

1030
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,480
right you know just to the average

1031
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,760
consumer you know you would say um I

1032
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,920
think that that's huge uh I know some of

1033
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,760
the testing that they have like uh with

1034
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,119
being able to determine whether it's

1035
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,200
male or female I know uh some things

1036
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,480
like that you know available um

1037
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:59,399
personally I've never uh you know used

1038
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,960
it but you know uh because at this point

1039
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,000
I'm I'm kind of stuck in the Stone Age

1040
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,679
with some of the things I'm like I'm

1041
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,039
going just stick to what I know and and

1042
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:10,159
whatnot you know um but yeah you know

1043
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:12,480
that's uh that that that's huge I mean

1044
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:13,799
accessibility is everything that DNA sex

1045
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,920
testing is what you're talking about I

1046
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,280
actually just sent out a bunch of

1047
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,920
samples the other day and I'm waiting to

1048
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,599
hear back that service is awesome little

1049
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,519
bit off topic here but but that's really

1050
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,119
helpful how long does that take once

1051
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:28,440
they receive the samples you're able to

1052
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:30,480
they flip it and within a day or so they

1053
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,000
give you the result and then so like I

1054
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,400
have seedlings that just popped mhm I

1055
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
went ahead and snipped off the cot lead

1056
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,960
leavea of each one sent those in and now

1057
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,440
I should be able to identify what the MS

1058
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,079
are and kill them off before I hit day

1059
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,838
14 of

1060
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:50,280
sprout and so like that helps out a ton

1061
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:53,159
because I'm not wasting time

1062
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,640
transplanting nutrients watering all

1063
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:57,519
that space all that stuff is saved cuz

1064
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:58,920
I'm able to kill off my males here and

1065
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:00,679
in about a week actually in a couple

1066
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,358
days wouldn't be surprised if I got it

1067
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:05,679
back on uh a Friday we're on Wednesday

1068
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,679
here and I shipped it out on Monday so

1069
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:09,358
yeah I should hopefully get the result

1070
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,358
back and then that that helps and

1071
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:11,519
actually does relate to the whole

1072
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:12,960
breeding side of things because that's a

1073
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:14,759
tool that you can use in order to kind

1074
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,358
of speed things up a little bit right so

1075
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,119
you're not just if you're not if you're

1076
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:19,838
not looking for males or if you just

1077
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:21,318
want to segregate your males you want to

1078
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:23,000
identify what your males and females are

1079
00:41:21,318 --> 00:41:24,358
and you can put them in different spaces

1080
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,719
yeah I guess it actually does relate to

1081
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:28,279
to what we're talking about here but

1082
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:29,719
yeah really good service I do use it

1083
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,440
often I'm going definitely that's

1084
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:34,598
something I'm might have to tap into for

1085
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,358
sure for sure um you know cuz while I

1086
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:39,318
I've more so kind of transition into the

1087
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:42,880
feno hunting and just locking in you

1088
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:44,199
know on this latest Cross of mind um you

1089
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,318
know that's definitely something in the

1090
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:47,799
future that will definitely speed up the

1091
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:49,599
process cuz like you say it's a lot of

1092
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,400
resources lost you know with the energy

1093
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,160
and everything else you know the all the

1094
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,720
lights and even though they've uh I

1095
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:57,559
think the energy build is you know

1096
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:58,959
they've condensed on that you know and

1097
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:01,639
helped out with the savings a little bit

1098
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,838
with the LED and everything but uh cuz

1099
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:05,400
man you know I started off with the

1100
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:10,358
metal highight and the uh what is that

1101
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:12,000
hpl uh the HPS yes yeah HPS thank you

1102
00:42:10,358 --> 00:42:13,519
thank you thank you it's been honestly

1103
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,358
it's really just been collecting dust

1104
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:17,519
you know uh at this point you know since

1105
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:20,480
I transition to LED it's like I can't go

1106
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:22,639
back while it it helped out a lot on the

1107
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,079
heating aspect of things you know if you

1108
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:27,879
didn't have a heater in the space and

1109
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,760
you had some cooler temperatures um I I

1110
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,838
just buy a mini heater at this point you

1111
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,559
know I think it yeah it eats up more uh

1112
00:42:32,838 --> 00:42:37,759
energy than anything so we have a lot of

1113
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:39,760
beginners that tune into this podcast

1114
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,920
really this podcast is for all

1115
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,280
experience levels beginner intermediate

1116
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,200
Advanced and the guests are also on all

1117
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,640
experience levels but we do have a lot

1118
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:48,838
of folks that are tuning in right now

1119
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:50,879
that are beginners and they're just

1120
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:53,880
getting started breeding what advice do

1121
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,160
you have for them watch Garden

1122
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,400
talk just continue to tune into to this

1123
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:00,399
podcast and uh you'll learn everything

1124
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,000
just Kidd that's it that's it you know

1125
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,519
hey hey grab a book obviously you know

1126
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,719
do your research you know cross

1127
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:10,159
reference um but really study study

1128
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:12,318
before just diving into it you know um

1129
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:15,239
you know uh save yourself you know a

1130
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:17,838
couple of steps you know uh that I could

1131
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:19,719
have saved I guess you know uh because I

1132
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:22,719
remember I think I killed my first two

1133
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:24,399
uh times around or I you know I don't
