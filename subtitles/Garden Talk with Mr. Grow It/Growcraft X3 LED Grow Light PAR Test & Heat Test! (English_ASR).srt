1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,629
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:01,318 --> 00:00:05,878
know me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:08,609
and you'll watch a my extra channel here

4
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:10,888
I have the grow craft x3 LED grow light

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:12,750
this is by chilled tech they sent me all

6
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:15,419
this light and in this video I'm going

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,550
to do a part test and I'm also gonna do

8
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:19,859
a heat test on this light as well I

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,150
already did a video where I unbox unit

10
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,760
and talked about some of the features

11
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:25,709
that videos on my main channel if you

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,240
want to see what comes in the box and

13
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,160
want to know what features this light

14
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:31,348
has I'll link that video in the

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,789
description section below also in the

16
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,469
description section will be a link to

17
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:36,390
this grow light so you can see the

18
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,370
listing and I'll show a discount code

19
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,710
down there as well for the power test

20
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:43,468
I'm gonna use the apogee mq 5 under par

21
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,259
meter this meter measures from 389

22
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,989
nanometers to 692 nanometers and the

23
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,519
measurements are in ppfd so if there's

24
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:52,679
any light being emitted from this

25
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,420
fixture outside of that range it's not

26
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,399
going to show on this meter and if you

27
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,079
need to this channel these part tests I

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,270
do just to give you a general idea of

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,980
what the power output is it's not going

30
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,629
to be exact I'm taking measurements

31
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,000
under grove tent and the reflective

32
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:08,039
walls could increase the part numbers so

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,688
just keep that in mind this LED grow

34
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,060
light has a flower and coverage area of

35
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:14,158
a 2 foot by 4 foot and I'm taking

36
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,290
measurements in a 2 foot by 4 foot grow

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,210
tent this light does have a dimmer on it

38
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,969
when I take the measurements I'll make

39
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:23,158
sure the dimmer is set to 100% so full

40
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,259
power I plug the grill light into my

41
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,960
kilowatt meter let's look at the amps

42
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:32,780
and watts I have the light fully dimmed

43
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:36,419
and it shows 0.24 amps and 25.6 watts

44
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:40,710
okay now full power 2.66

45
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:43,340
amps 324 watts alright now let's get

46
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:43,339
into the measurements

47
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,290
