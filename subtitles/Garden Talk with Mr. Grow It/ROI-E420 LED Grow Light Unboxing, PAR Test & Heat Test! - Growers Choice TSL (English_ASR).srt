1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,569
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,910
know me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:07,949
and you'll watch a Max's channel here I

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,440
have a brand new LED grow light this one

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,969
was just released today for twenty

6
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:17,100
twenty twenty this is the roie 420 LED

7
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:18,960
grow light and this is by growers choice

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,390
they sent me over the scroll light in

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,339
order to do this video right here in

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,320
this video I am going to unbox the unit

11
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:27,960
so you'll see what comes in the box also

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,028
test the power output and I'll do a heat

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,710
test I'm not gonna talk about the grow

14
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:33,988
lights features like I do on some of my

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,700
videos but what I will do is leave a

16
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:37,379
link to this grow light in the

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,969
description section below so you can

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,280
learn more about it I also leave a

19
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,050
discount code down there discount code

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,789
mister grow it will give you a

21
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:46,649
percentage off so just want to give you

22
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,558
a heads up on that okay so first thing

23
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,270
out the box is a user manual this user

24
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:55,500
manual has a ton of good information

25
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:58,170
about the light next is a 120 240 volt

26
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,840
adapter here's a bag with two rope

27
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,760
ratchets in them another bag with two

28
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,430
more rope ratchets so they include four

29
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,259
rope ratchets two total and lastly is

30
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,229
the fixture and the power cord is

31
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,450
actually attached to the fixture for the

32
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:14,640
part test I'm going to use the appo gmq

33
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,939
500 power meter this mean your measures

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,000
from 389 nanometers to 692 nanometers

35
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:22,589
and the measurements are in ppfd I do

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,118
these part test videos just to give you

37
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,820
a general idea of what the power output

38
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:28,739
is it's not going to be 100% accurate I

39
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,349
take these power measurements in grow

40
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:33,359
tents which have reflective walls that

41
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:34,109
could increase the numbers so just keep

42
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,840
that in mind

43
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:39,359
the roie 420 has a flowering coverage

44
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,469
area of three foot by three foot but I

45
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,060
don't have a three foot by three foot

46
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:43,978
grow tent so I'm gonna take measurements

47
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,049
in a four foot by four foot grow tent

48
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:48,179
and I'll do my best to keep my par meter

49
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,100
in a three foot by three foot area in

50
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,720
their instruction manual they don't say

51
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:53,669
what the light distance should be for

52
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,280
the different stages of growth but after

53
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,519
putting my par meter under the light 12

54
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,079
inches 18 inches and 24 inches seem to

55
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,060
be the proper distances for the

56
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,489
different stages of growth in my opinion

57
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,600
this light does have a dimmer on it but

58
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:09,780
I'll take the measurements when the

59
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:12,030
dimmer is set to 100% okay so I plugged

60
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,259
the light into the kilowatt meter it is

61
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,390
at 100%

62
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:19,408
it shows three point six three amps

63
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:22,578
pulling 440 watts from the wall alright

64
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:22,578
let's get into the measurements

65
00:02:34,389 --> 00:03:43,319

what do you think of these measurements

76
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,830
let me know in the comment section below

77
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:56,060
just a reminder that there is a link for

this grow light in the description

79

section below along with the discount

80
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,729
code and I'll leave it at that thank you

81
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:04,509
so much for watching and until next time
