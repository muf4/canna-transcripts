89
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,400
over on YouTube and

90
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,560
Instagram and uh I've been growing

91
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,640
plants for about 6 years now don't have

92
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,840
a green thumb at all everything that I

93
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:41,839
do I have diligently learned from the

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,560
YouTube gurus such as Chris

95
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,319
here uh so this is something that uh I

96
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,120
never thought I would be able to do but

97
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:53,199
with hard work and dedication I've

98
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,280
learned how to grow and I've learned how

99
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,479
much joy that these plants can give to

100
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,400
you awesome and what would you say your

101
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,759
grow style is are you indoors Outdoors

102
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,680
are you in soil cocoa Hydro are you

103
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:07,239
synthetic organic what's your style well

104
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,200
I'm doing a little bit of everything

105
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,640
right now actually it's it's really fun

106
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,318
right now in the garden uh so I am

107
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,918
mainly indoors but I am from Canada and

108
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,918
we are allowed for recreational plants

109
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,039
so those are my outdoor girls so I have

110
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:24,839
my medical Garden indoors and then my uh

111
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,360
Freedom Four as we like to call it here

112
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,719
uh those are my Outdoors so I've just

113
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,000
recently put them out in the in the m

114
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,919
long weekend is when it's safe for us to

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,399
put them

116
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:39,599
outside and I am mainly an organic

117
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:43,279
grower uh but currently I am using an EB

118
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,160
and flow system that I am loving it and

119
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,399
I'm so I'm dipping my toes into that

120
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,919
little bit of a I I think it I call it

121
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:52,359
like a like baby Hydro it's like Hydro

122
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,799
but not really Hydro because it's just

123
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,319
you know it just soaks and and drains

124
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,600
soaks and drains so it's like to me it's

125
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:03,519
not like I'm a chemist so I I'm I'm

126
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,400
really excited about that and um and

127
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,918
that's first time running synthetic uh

128
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:11,359
nutrients as well so that's that's been

129
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:13,478
a big learning curve for me so right now

130
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,120
a little bit of both but mainly indoor

131
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:18,038
and organic awesome and for the record

132
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,478
that is a real background I had asked

133
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:22,159
her before we hit the record button

134
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,758
unbelievable beautiful beautiful

135
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,600
background I am so so jealous of that

136
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,120
thank you actually my outdoor girls are

137
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,879
going to be watered with lake water all

138
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,478
summer so um I'm just going to go down

139
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,360
the stairs to the beach and grab a scoop

140
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:41,159
of Lake water and uh get all the good

141
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,720
microbes from from the natural lake and

142
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,000
that's what my outdoor girls are being

143
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,120
fed this year that's so cool and for

144
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,560
those listening in on podcast platforms

145
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,360
can't see this she's right on a lake and

146
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,360
there's a bunch of greenery there and I

147
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,240
know you're from Canada and it's just

148
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,240
I'm just jealous that's all I got to say

149
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,160
about that one it's beautiful it really

150
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,240
is

151
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,280
thank you we it is definitely our little

152
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,439
piece of heaven here so let's get into

153
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:08,719
plant training I figured we'd start with

154
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:11,240
kind of the basics you know what are the

155
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,520
benefits of training

156
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,800
plants I I I feel the benefits are one

157
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,359
it's so fun oh my goodness that's like

158
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,478
the main benefit right there it's just

159
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,240
so fun to play with the plants um but it

160
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:28,800
it adds structure to each of the

161
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,598
branches so uh later on um they can hold

162
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,319
up their own weight

163
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:36,519
and the

164
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,960
more girth girthier the the branch the

165
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:40,879
easier it will be later on in flow to

166
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,079
hold up its own weight I don't like

167
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,560
putting trellis Nets and and that sort

168
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:48,038
of stuff over my colas it's just too

169
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,519
fussy and it just it makes me mad I just

170
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:53,159
get frustrated so I like to train them

171
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:55,719
early and get them nice and strong so

172
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,599
they can hold up their weight later on

173
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,319
awesome yeah there are definitely some

174
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,598
really good benefits to training plants

175
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,879
you know one of the things that I

176
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,680
particularly like is that it helps with

177
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:08,280
the distribution of light in a sense

178
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,478
right because if you are in a grow tent

179
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:11,959
for example and you just letting the

180
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,038
plants grow naturally Christmas tree

181
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:16,120
style you typically have that one Cola

182
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:17,519
that just kind of comes up and dominates

183
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,519
well those lower branches aren't going

184
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,159
to receive as much light right and so I

185
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:23,639
know it's genetic dependent and stuff

186
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,120
like that but you could see kind of

187
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,720
lower quality on the lower buds but you

188
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,160
know a lot of genetics these days it's

189
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,440
it ends up being just fine but if you're

190
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,639
training and you have you're training

191
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:36,439
the plants you're manipulating the

192
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,519
plants so they are even canopy across

193
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,918
the entire grow space well then you've

194
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,799
got that light shining down and there

195
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,639
have actually been some studies where

196
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,439
you can get a higher yield from training

197
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,478
versus not training so that's I think

198
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,120
that's another reason why a lot of

199
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:51,519
people do it but there are always

200
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,478
downsides to things as well right what

201
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,639
are the downsides to plant

202
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:58,918
training oh breaking a branch there's

203
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,280
nothing worse than just being a little

204
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:02,878
too rough with that and and breaking a

205
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,959
branch and you know I'm such a good

206
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,158
Canadian I was oh sorry my little girls

207
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:10,198
I always always feel so bad and I I run

208
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:13,158
out and get my painters tape and I try

209
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,960
to save them as much as I can and you

210
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:17,519
know um but if you can't save it you've

211
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,959
always got yourself a nice clone if

212
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,318
you're not running an auto flower if

213
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,478
you're running if you're running uh a a

214
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:25,759
a a proper girl that you you could just

215
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:29,719
cloner and so there's really

216
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:32,440
no downsides other than you might get an

217
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,360
extra clone out of

218
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,479
it I would say one downside I've got one

219
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,519
in mind which is that it's just it's a

220
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,360
little bit more work right you getting

221
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,639
in there spending the time to do

222
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,720
whatever type of training you decide to

223
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,639
do we're going to go over the different

224
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,278
training types here in this episode but

225
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:51,278
anything from just tying the branches

226
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,639
down to high stress train techniques

227
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,679
where you're topping the plant actually

228
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,759
removing some things it takes a little

229
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:58,519
bit of time right now that's not to say

230
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:00,838
that the reward isn't going to be better

231
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:01,919
cuz it it certainly can be so yeah

232
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,519
that's the only thing I can really think

233
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:07,039
of as far as like a a downside to plant

234
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:08,959
training yeah see I don't consider that

235
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,719
being a downside because that's time I

236
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,759
get to spend with my girls that's part

237
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,680
of the fun part right like that's just

238
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:17,078
you know I get to tune out the world and

239
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,879
I'm I'm just that's I'm just in tune

240
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:21,319
with with my girls in the tent and

241
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,480
taking care of business in there so yeah

242
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,959
that's probably why that didn't come to

243
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,800
me I didn't I don't think of that as a

244
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:28,278
downside so that's that's one of the

245
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,519
perks great Point great Point yeah I

246
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:30,879
know there are a lot of people who are

247
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,799
are you know they monitor the amount of

248
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,559
time they're in there and they try to

249
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,000
reduce the time that they're in there a

250
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,278
lot of people have real automated

251
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,278
systems now to where they don't only

252
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:42,600
have to check in their plants once a day

253
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:44,720
if that and they're in there for a very

254
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,639
short period of time so yeah there are

255
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,040
some people who really just try to limit

256
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:49,919
the time in their Garden so they can do

257
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:51,240
other things or there are people that

258
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,759
really love the garden and they want to

259
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,039
spend more time in there so really

260
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:57,439
depends on how you are as a person

261
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,799
exactly and and training's not necessary

262
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,600
so if you don't have the time to get in

263
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:05,078
there that's fine you know if you do

264
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,680
it's wonderful and so rewarding great

265
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:07,879
Point yeah it is a completely optional

266
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:09,879
to do all this stuff you can let the

267
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:11,958
plant grow naturally Christmas tree

268
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:13,838
style whatever and get to a harvest I

269
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:15,518
know that's uh back when I first started

270
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,240
growing I didn't want to do any training

271
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,320
I was afraid to top the plant CU I just

272
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,360
like oh no I want this to be successful

273
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,519
I don't want to destroy the plant right

274
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,720
so like I let I've had several Grows

275
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:27,639
Where I just let the plants grow

276
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,200
naturally but you know as you get more

277
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:32,000
comfortable growing and more confident

278
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,200
you uh tend to manipulate the planet a

279
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,799
little bit more and more and see what

280
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,959
they can take and you can be really

281
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:39,879
rough with them for sure I find you just

282
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,479
one good training session you know if

283
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:43,519
you don't have a lot of time if you're

284
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,278
just about to flip you know maybe the

285
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,278
week before a flip just give it one good

286
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,078
training session and I mean that's

287
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,838
wonderful as well you don't have to be

288
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:53,879
in there every day uh moving this leaf

289
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,040
and moving that leaf you can go in and

290
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:58,799
just give her one good training session

291
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,519
and it's you'll still see benefits

292
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,240
completely agree yeah you can definitely

293
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:03,839
go about it that way you can definitely

294
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,120
be very efficient when it comes to

295
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,920
training as well by kind of planning and

296
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,360
stuff and and knowing exactly what

297
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,599
you're going to do and stuff like that

298
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,759
so so when do you start training plants

299
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,800
and when do you stop training plants so

300
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:19,679
I like to start actually quite quite

301
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:22,559
young uh as soon as I see that their the

302
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:26,399
true leaves have come in and they've got

303
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:28,319
a little little bit of um meat on their

304
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,360
bones let's say you know they're not

305
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,480
they're not the baby baby seedlings if

306
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,079
you can tell that they're they're

307
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,600
starting to grow then I I like to just

308
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,359
bend bend them over just slightly just

309
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,278
you know just enough

310
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,120
to give them a little a little crooked

311
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:44,838
and then they bounce back from that and

312
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,799
then the next day I'll come in and and

313
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:49,040
I'll bend them the other way the other

314
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,919
direction and then they'll bounce back

315
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:55,078
and then once I start seeing uh a couple

316
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:57,559
of nodes starting to show up then I'll

317
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:59,439
get a little bit more dramatic and I

318
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,518
actually start when their seedlings I'll

319
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,440
just go in and take my tip of my finger

320
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,959
and just give them a little a little

321
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,519
flick sometimes just to kind of wake

322
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,278
them up and stimulate them and let them

323
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,480
know hey come on it's time it's time to

324
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,639
get going here we got uh we got some

325
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,079
growing to

326
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,360
do a train early train often that's a

327
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,958
motto that a lot of people go by I

328
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,720
personally I think I usually wait till

329
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,198
like the third node then I'm doing

330
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,639
something you know I'm either doing a

331
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:28,599
Bend or I am doing some a topping but

332
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,720
yeah as far as the bending I mean just

333
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,480
manipulating that way that's really low

334
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,160
stress training is there any other type

335
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,360
of like low stress training you do are

336
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,319
you TI like when the plates gets bigger

337
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,839
are you tying branches down to the side

338
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,720
of the grow pot or anything or how do

339
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,560
you go about like low stress training

340
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,079
throughout the grow cycle so once once

341
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,278
the girls have have uh say reached about

342
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:51,479
the third node that's when I start

343
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:54,000
getting a little bit more aggressive so

344
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,079
I will start bending them over a little

345
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,399
bit more dramatically and then once I

346
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:02,120
see that they're bouncing back uh fairly

347
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:05,399
quickly I'll actually start introducing

348
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:10,039
Bud clips into the mix so as soon as the

349
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:12,159
uh the stock is um sturdy enough that I

350
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:17,399
can bend the top over and it can take

351
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:19,159
the weight of the bud Clips um they uh

352
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,480
they get it right from right from the

353
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:25,278
get-go so then I'll bend them over so

354
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:29,839
they'll now be at um at a at a certain

355
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:33,240
angle and the top will raise up then as

356
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,240
they grow out I will add an additional

357
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,360
Bud clip until they reach the edge of

358
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,360
the pot and uh this is something I've

359
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,800
added into my garden over the last

360
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:47,639
couple of years and I'll never turn back

361
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:51,000
I used to I used to uh use paper clips

362
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:53,720
and garden ties and and all sorts of

363
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,320
things this has made it so simple these

364
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,440
clips and the weight of the clips

365
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,278
actually helps stimulate the growth of

366
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,959
the the plant as well because there's

367
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,519
something heavy when they're when

368
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:08,518
they're small of course when they're

369
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:12,879
small um but as they as they get

370
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:14,679
stronger and they get more Vi vigorous

371
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,919
uh you can add more and it's just so

372
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:19,278
much fun to add all these clips in and

373
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:22,559
then when you when they've grown into

374
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:25,519
them and you you almost make like a

375
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,000
staircase with your branches and so you

376
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,879
start from the center and you make these

377
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,639
staircases all the way out to the edge

378
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:34,159
of your pots and when you remove the

379
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:36,120
clips it is the most amazing sight to

380
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,879
see those legs once they're all cleaned

381
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:42,639
up they have those that I call it like

382
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,958
the staircase to Heaven I just love it

383
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,039
that's so cool you know I actually

384
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:48,039
haven't used any of those particular

385
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:50,958
style of Clips I see a lot of people

386
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:53,278
using them I've always wondered how well

387
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:56,719
they actually helped train the plants

388
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:59,720
how many are you actually using per run

389
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,399
uh it it it really depends on on the

390
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:06,160
cultivar uh but at least probably about

391
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,958
five or six at the minimum uh cuz what I

392
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:11,000
like to do is spread it out from the

393
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:13,000
center and spread it out and these uh

394
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,159
these clips are in such a a wonderful

395
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,958
angle that they don't stress the plant

396
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:23,639
out they don't um over hyperextend it I

397
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:24,838
guess the word would be um so they are

398
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,600
like

399
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,959
ergonomically correct um but you can you

400
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,000
can add as many or as little as you want

401
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:36,119
if you just want to bend the top over

402
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,278
and not have to go in and fuss and mus

403
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,759
with the with the rest of the plant you

404
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:44,240
can just do the one uh I like to add

405
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,759
lots and just get those girls as spread

406
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,360
out as I possibly can and then

407
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,600
eventually they stay there you only need

408
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,800
to have those clips on for for a week or

409
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,600
so and then the plant has been trained

410
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,078
to go in that direction then you can

411
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,120
move them around and you can play with

412
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,479
the different branches and and really

413
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:04,440
maximize your canopy I was going to ask

414
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,680
if you leave the clips on does the stock

415
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,360
end up does the branch end up like

416
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:10,198
growing into the clips and kind of get

417
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,800
stuck or what um actually that's the

418
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:15,838
beauty of these clips so we're we forget

419
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:19,039
you know we you you forget these things

420
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,759
inside the inside the plant they are

421
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:25,240
actually meant to break before they hurt

422
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,639
your plant so if you put it on the stock

423
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,720
and you put it down at the bottom and

424
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,318
you completely forget they will actually

425
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,639
it's it's a safety mechanism they will

426
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:37,198
break before they hurt your plant now

427
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:39,600
your plant is is very um Adept to

428
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:42,000
growing around things and and sometimes

429
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,480
you'll you'll see that the the the stock

430
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,759
is like growing melding into it and it's

431
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,720
now become part of the plant but it will

432
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:50,839
never hurt your plant because they will

433
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,600
break they will snap in half now I've

434
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,600
never had that happen that's my goal I

435
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,839
want to get I want to get this

436
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,720
thing so big that I want them snapping I

437
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,839
want to test this

438
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,278
haven't had it happen yet but they are

439
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,640
they are very safe and that is a

440
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:08,798
wonderful safety mechanism in them and

441
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,799
um they are uh very well thought out

442
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,519
it's a very well thought out product for

443
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,879
those just listening she was holding up

444
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:17,480
the bud Clips by Bud trainer so I'm

445
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,000
familiar with that brand I'm actually

446
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,679
I'm thinking about picking them up I'm

447
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,679
looking at on Amazon right now 20 bucks

448
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:25,319
for a 20 pack so not too bad I mean you

449
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,519
get you reuse them over and over again

450
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:28,960
as long as they don't break like you

451
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:31,079
mentioned but uh you reuse them over

452
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,519
over again per gross so think I might

453
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:35,079
pick some up and try it out and you can

454
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,000
actually throw them in the dishwasher as

455
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:40,199
well I have um from when my my children

456
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,558
were small I have a a small basket that

457
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:46,360
we used to use for their bottles and uh

458
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:47,798
I just put them all in the basket and

459
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:49,399
run it through my dishwasher and then

460
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:52,119
they're clean and sanitized and ready to

461
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,759
go for the next time so don't ever throw

462
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:55,798
don't overthrow ever throw those little

463
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,558
baskets away because they're

464
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:00,119
wonderful easy to clean I like it yep

465
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:01,599
have you you ever heard of the no

466
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:04,879
technique plant

467
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,399
training no this is just fascinating I

468
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,679
don't I please I heard about this and

469
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,240
I've talked about it on our podcast

470
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:12,240
before I actually had uh I think it was

471
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,519
pigeons 420 I had on a podcast and we

472
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,200
talked about plant training because he's

473
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,158
he's big into it and uh I don't think he

474
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,960
knew what it was either but if you

475
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:22,799
search on Google you'll find no

476
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,960
technique plant training which is

477
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,079
basically all it is is just one Bend so

478
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,200
you're letting the plant grow to a

479
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:31,599
certain point bending it down 90° and

480
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,319
then that's it you're not doing any

481
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,678
other training beyond that and the

482
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:37,000
thought is that the other branches that

483
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,519
come up you're going to have a whole

484
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,558
bunch of branches kind of coming up and

485
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:44,158
that they should be even uh but it's an

486
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:45,639
easy way to do training if you're kind

487
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:46,640
of looking to ease your way into it

488
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,720
right you don't want to do a whole bunch

489
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,200
of different things you just want to try

490
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,880
one thing no technique plant training

491
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,919
you might want to try that so fig to

492
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,000
mention it oh that see that's the bud

493
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:59,240
Clips would be perfect for that you put

494
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,519
one clip in and you're done there we go

495
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,279
you don't even need the 20 pack you just

496
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:05,038
need

497
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:08,200
one how about Leaf tucking that's

498
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:10,158
another sort of training that people do

499
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,558
throughout the grow really is tucking

500
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:14,880
leaves down and that allows light to get

501
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,359
kind of get down into the canopy more do

502
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,799
you do any Leaf tucking at all if so at

503
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,359
what point in the grow do you usually do

504
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:25,480
it uh I like to do leaf tucking actually

505
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:27,558
uh during flow so uh when I prep the

506
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,159
girls to go into flour they get a good

507
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:31,960
defoliation I I clean everything up but

508
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:34,559
then as those leaves come back within

509
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,480
the next 3 weeks during that that burst

510
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,240
of growth uh I will tuck leaves because

511
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,120
those are the solar panels you don't

512
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,200
want to you don't want to strip all of

513
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:46,239
the leaves so I will tuck them to to um

514
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,319
make sure that the flower sites are

515
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,519
exposed okay yeah that's typically when

516
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,558
I'm doing it as well although I have

517
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:55,119
found value in doing it in veg sometimes

518
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:57,279
like after I topped a plant and I've got

519
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,319
those two branches kind of growing up

520
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,519
those two top branches I've actually

521
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:03,038
used leaves to kind of that are

522
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:06,158
underneath the branches directly bring

523
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:07,798
them up over the branch and kind of tuck

524
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,320
it so the whole branch is kind of being

525
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:13,400
tucked down with that pedal from the

526
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:14,879
leaf below it don't know if everybody

527
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,360
caught that visual if everybody was able

528
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,480
to visually understand what I was

529
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:19,599
talking about there but that's I think

530
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,400
the easiest way I kind of kind of

531
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,798
explain it that's been helpful

532
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,400
particularly trying to get some of the

533
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:27,319
lower branches to grow up so after

534
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,480
topping is done keeping those top

535
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:32,079
branches manageable and allowing the

536
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,960
lowers to catch up other than that yeah

537
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,558
flowering as well is we're just in

538
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,279
flowering just kind of tucking leaves

539
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:39,240
down underneath Bud s sites and stuff

540
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,879
and trying to get light down into the

541
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,120
canopy so it's helpful so we mentioned

542
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,280
topping a couple times and really that's

543
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:48,639
just cutting off the top of the plant or

544
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:50,440
the top of a branch of the plant you can

545
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,360
do it several different ways I usually

546
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,519
start either the third fourth or fifth

547
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:56,719
node I'll do my first topping and then

548
00:20:54,519 --> 00:21:00,158
it helps the lower branches kind of grow

549
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,200
up oftentimes I do a second top as well

550
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,799
the the the branches that come out from

551
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,600
the first topping top those again and

552
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,879
then uh helps them more and you can

553
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,918
continue to do that I've topped cheese

554
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,400
to where I had 32 different colas kind

555
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,840
of coming up and in my opinion that was

556
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,400
a little bit of an Overkill I don't

557
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:20,000
think I'll ever do that much growing

558
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,600
indoors in particular um you know I like

559
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,079
to stick at eight or 16 tops is my

560
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:28,359
personal preference do you do topping at

561
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:31,240
all if so when do you usually do topping

562
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:33,558
I have talked in the past uh I'm I'm

563
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,759
more into I've lean more into the low

564
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:39,359
stress training now um as opposed to

565
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:42,158
topping but I'm not opposed to it at all

566
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:44,959
sometimes I will be low stress training

567
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,840
and then oops there goes the top so I

568
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,840
guess we've topped

569
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:56,720
it it happens um but uh but I I I don't

570
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:59,960
focus on the topping as much as the the

571
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:03,798
low stress training uh I just found that

572
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:07,319
the the results were almost better

573
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:09,278
without the high stress early on got it

574
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:10,319
yeah and it's you know it's so debatable

575
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:11,599
some people like oh well if you're

576
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:13,879
topping you're doing high stress and

577
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,759
you're slowing the growth of the plant

578
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,080
kind of debatable to how much it's

579
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,079
actually slowing down and yeah you can

580
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:21,879
totally get away with just doing the low

581
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,599
stress training without doing any

582
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,640
topping throughout the whole grow so a

583
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:27,918
lot of people do it that way and uh yeah

584
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,520
at that point you're not really slowing

585
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,960
down the plant grow grow at all huh so I

586
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:35,200
take it since you haven't really played

587
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,640
around with topping much fing is another

588
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,319
thing you probably don't have much

589
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,799
experience with or or what I I have done

590
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:43,918
it uh when I was when I was learning I

591
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:44,960
tried everything and you know it's

592
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,520
that's what you do when you're when

593
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,840
you're learning you try a little bit of

594
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:51,759
everything to see what uh what's your

595
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:53,959
style and how you would like to to have

596
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:57,000
your garden R run but I have tried

597
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:59,798
fimming before and I don't know the

598
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,480
leaves weren't pretty it didn't look

599
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:05,158
nice it just it l it looked messy to me

600
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,640
and I did I didn't like it and I didn't

601
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:11,600
really see much more of a a benefit I

602
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:14,520
would rather I would rather top than fim

603
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:16,918
just for aesthetic reasons

604
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:19,200
only I hear you yeah I've done it

605
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,120
accidentally numerous times countless

606
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,200
number of times and really for those

607
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,759
folks that aren't too familiar with what

608
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,840
fimming is really it's it's kind of like

609
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,519
a topping but you top at the wrong spot

610
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,558
you top a little bit too high and

611
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:34,158
instead of it splitting in into two

612
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:37,200
branches it can go into three it can go

613
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:39,159
into four so you go more than just the

614
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,558
two and I've had multiple times where I

615
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:41,760
just got three branches out of it which

616
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,079
I was like oh that's pretty cool I

617
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:44,720
thought it was always going to be four

618
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:47,480
nope it can actually just split out into

619
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,000
three different branches and the story

620
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,919
behind it is actually uh wrong in a

621
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,200
sense to where a lot of people say

622
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:57,520
that's a story behind fimming is that

623
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:00,600
some guy tried to top and he missed and

624
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:03,558
he's like F I missed insert the swear

625
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:05,639
word there but F I missed and then so

626
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:07,319
that's where fim came from but I

627
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,360
actually recently learned from Kyle

628
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:12,759
kushman that uh he had mentioned in the

629
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:14,759
podcast episode I did with him that that

630
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:16,720
actually isn't the case it was really

631
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:19,440
somebody who submitted a question into

632
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,679
High Times and they signed their name

633
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,840
fim and so uh yeah that's it's kind of

634
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,000
funny to see how that story was just

635
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:29,639
randomly created and now it's that's not

636
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,398
actually it but uh yeah he he would tell

637
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,520
more details on it if you guys want to

638
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:35,839
warp back to the episode I did with him

639
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,200
there's time stamps on every episode so

640
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,639
you should be able to click right into

641
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,759
when we talk about fing and you can hear

642
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,200
the story behind it uh because I

643
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:43,759
definitely didn't didn't say it properly

644
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,080
I probably butchered it a little bit but

645
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:46,640
for the most part yeah apparently

646
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:49,918
somebody signed the name f it wasn't

647
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:52,520
actually F I missed wow you know the

648
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,640
that's how these urban legends are are

649
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:57,759
created you know like the the whole myth

650
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,640
about how 420 was created and there's so

651
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,839
many different

652
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,720
different you know versions of the story

653
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,798
I'm sure we've heard them all you know

654
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,278
so I mean how do you know which one's

655
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:11,398
right you don't right you just got

656
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:13,599
assume let's move on to super cropping

657
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:17,119
so is that something you do at all or no

658
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:19,359
oh yes oh yes I love my super cropping

659
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,759
that you're talking about Kyle kushman

660
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,319
uh I do the kushman Chiropractic it is

661
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:27,038
something

662
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:28,720
I that snap that pop that you hear I

663
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:31,879
just

664
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,880
it brings me so much

665
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:39,440
joy yeah so I like to I like to Super

666
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:41,038
crop as soon as it's I I like to do it

667
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,798
uh right before I'm about ready to go

668
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:47,119
into flour maybe about a week or so uh

669
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:50,038
when when the plant has the structure

670
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,918
and is ready you know I'm like okay I

671
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:53,599
know I'm you're ready to go I'll get in

672
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,000
there and I'll start from the very

673
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:59,119
bottom and I'll pinch the branch uh with

674
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,319
one hand on each side and I'll give it a

675
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:04,759
little twist so it's like you he he he

676
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,599
says it's like um like the Chiropractic

677
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:08,359
like you're you're popping the spine and

678
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:09,918
I'll do that to each and every branch

679
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:12,038
and I'll start right at the very bottom

680
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:15,159
and I'll go all the way right up to the

681
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:18,278
very tippy tippy top

682
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:20,799
and the I the only caveat I would

683
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:22,919
suggest is don't water right before

684
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:25,519
you're about to do that cuz you can snap

685
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:27,440
off a branch a little bit uh easier if

686
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,960
there's a lot of water inside your

687
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,440
plants if they just

688
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,278
had a nice big drink and you give it a a

689
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,399
pop the pop is a little bit more

690
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:37,880
satisfying but you you run the risk of

691
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:40,079
breaking a branch a little bit more

692
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,679
somebody's got to do like an ASMR video

693
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:45,278
with just the cracks that are happening

694
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:47,038
from the cop that' be funny oh my

695
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,398
goodness if you've never if you've never

696
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,640
experienced it before just do yourself

697
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:53,678
one one favor and just do that one

698
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,000
little twist one hand on each side of

699
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,120
the branch and just give it a little

700
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,759
twist not much just enough to hear that

701
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:02,038
pop and oh so satisfying so you only

702
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,519
doing like a pop is it still like the

703
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:05,440
branch still kind of Sting up straight

704
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,240
or are you like manipulating enough to

705
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,120
where it's a flopping

706
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:14,960
over um at this point I've done all of

707
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:18,000
my training uh to where my plant is

708
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:21,120
exactly where I want it to be so I don't

709
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,919
I don't usually do a super crop to the

710
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:26,038
point where I'm flopping the branches

711
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:30,200
over unless I need to um but usually all

712
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:34,000
of my training is done three going into

713
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:36,640
this stage um so the the the plant is a

714
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,519
beautiful Globe shape and I'm just

715
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,759
popping those branches to make sure that

716
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:43,398
they she's got those Knuckles to to be

717
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:45,359
able to hold up the weight later on

718
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:46,759
that's exactly what I heard from other

719
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,079
people I think it was pigeons 420 who

720
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:50,119
mentioned he does the same exact thing

721
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,839
to where every single branch in order to

722
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:53,599
try to strengthen up the branches so

723
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,359
that way when they're flowering they're

724
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:59,678
able to hold up those big fat buds a lot

725
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:01,479
easier than if you didn't do it so it's

726
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,399
something that I haven't done on every

727
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:06,240
single Branch before maybe one grow I

728
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:09,759
will do just for fun maybe it's content

729
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,519
right I use super cropping a little bit

730
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:15,319
differently and that's really only in

731
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:16,919
flour I use it just in the first three

732
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:19,278
weeks of stretch right so the plan is

733
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,200
still stretching upward now if I'm not

734
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:22,640
able to do low stress training because

735
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,480
I'm still trying to maintain that can

736
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,480
even canopy and so those first 3 weeks

737
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,839
of flower and the lead cyos changed

738
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,200
plants are still stretching the heights

739
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:32,480
are changing right for each of the

740
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,519
branches so if I can't bend them all

741
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,240
down and keep them even well sometimes

742
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:40,200
those Center branches those are ones I

743
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,599
can't really just pull down with the low

744
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,080
stress train so what I'll do is I'll do

745
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:46,038
a super crop let that let those branches

746
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:47,759
flop over and then the the outer

747
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:50,960
branches really will will continue to

748
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:53,000
grow up and then it will kind of be even

749
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,480
the goal is really to have it even by

750
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,519
the end of the stretch phase so that's

751
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,079
really the only way I use super cropping

752
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:01,919
myself and that's the goal out of all of

753
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:06,240
this training is to get that even canopy

754
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:09,240
to get the maximum light available and

755
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,359
the maximum we can from the plants yeah

756
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,319
and it could be so helpful for sure

757
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:16,918
let's move on to lollipopping now Lolly

758
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:19,599
popping is categorized into the training

759
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,159
area right people say oh well it's

760
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:23,119
actually pruning it's a pruning

761
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:24,960
technique it's not a train technique

762
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,278
well okay let's just include in the

763
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,759
conversation whatever way you think

764
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:29,880
about it let's include it let's talk

765
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:33,519
about lollipopping so what is

766
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:37,559
lollipopping and do you do it at all oh

767
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:41,558
I love a clean leg oh I love a clean

768
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:45,319
leg so lollipopping is taking the uh the

769
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:48,558
foliage from the bottom of the bottom of

770
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:50,639
the plant all the way up to the canopy

771
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:53,879
to where you would like your canopy to

772
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,278
begin and uh it's to help maximize the

773
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,240
air flow

774
00:29:55,278 --> 00:30:00,880
inside um I I always I always always

775
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,798
tease on our on our shows that uh that I

776
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,320
I it's Friday night get your get your

777
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:07,200
legs shaved because uh that's another

778
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:10,398
term for it is shaving up the legs

779
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:14,319
shaving up the girls uh to have that

780
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:17,239
bottom area nice and clean and there's

781
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:20,480
you you it helps with pests it helps

782
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:23,359
with airflow so so much it's just a

783
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:27,000
clean nice clean area and when do you

784
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:29,798
typically do it uh throughout the life

785
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,200
actually as as much as I can I will try

786
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:35,639
and keep those that Center area as clean

787
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,240
as possible but right before flower in

788
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,480
that in that week or so right before

789
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,359
flower is when I just strip those girls

790
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,960
right up and uh give them a real good

791
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:48,000
training session and and really that's

792
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,000
the that's the key is right before about

793
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,960
a week before flower is to get all of

794
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,679
this done so then the plant has time to

795
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,120
recover before it has to start focusing

796
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:59,038
on creating those big beautiful buds

797
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,158
that we all want yeah I'm the same way

798
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,278
I'll do it right before flipping the

799
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,120
flower often times really during stretch

800
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,398
phase the first three weeks there still

801
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:09,439
can be some growth down there so I'm

802
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:11,599
usually going in around you know day 14

803
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,919
to 20 something like that to where I'm

804
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:15,558
doing another strip of the lowers and

805
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,600
it's not as much right I've done the

806
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:19,398
bulk of the work before flipping the

807
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:21,719
flower but there is a little bit of

808
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:23,518
cleanup that can still happen and then

809
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,679
as the plants continue on from there

810
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,519
into flowering you can get little buds

811
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,519
that kind of form down on the lowers and

812
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm usually plucking those off as well

813
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:34,519
and um yeah so I'm just like you we kind

814
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,960
of doing a little bit throughout the

815
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:38,720
whole cycle really yeah it's I I find

816
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,919
it's just maintenance if I'm in there

817
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,480
and I'm I'm seeing a a spot that needs

818
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:44,720
to be clean up just take care of it now

819
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,720
it just saves you work later on and then

820
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,000
that energy is being focused to where we

821
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,600
want it it's not where you know when

822
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,679
nobody wants to trim the lar right so

823
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,839
you know you get rid of it just get get

824
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,559
those big beautiful flowers and I mean

825
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:58,359
that's the goal we that's that's what we

826
00:31:57,558 --> 00:32:00,359
want

827
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:02,319
yeah it definitely helps with the upper

828
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,119
growth that's for sure and yeah all the

829
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:05,879
lar just ends up in my trim pile these

830
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:08,599
days I don't I don't trim that anymore I

831
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,840
used to but uh my standards have gotten

832
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:13,000
a little bit higher since then so ends

833
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:15,000
up my trim pile or you know I could end

834
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,679
up in a compost pile as well so either

835
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,038
or another thing that's kind of looped

836
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:22,038
into a training category but some people

837
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:24,278
say hey no it's Bruning is defoliation

838
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:28,119
right what is defoliation and when do

839
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:29,839
you go about doing it oh defoliation is

840
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:33,038
just getting rid of those uh big fan

841
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:35,678
leaves that are covering up what you are

842
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:37,558
trying to grow you know you you you want

843
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,880
to keep like I said earlier try and keep

844
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:42,879
a clean a clean space and get that air

845
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,760
flow and uh if you have too many leaves

846
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,919
on top of each other you can get micro

847
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:52,079
clients and get clients climates excuse

848
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:54,639
me and um moisture and then you're

849
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,439
you're opening yourself up to problems

850
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:59,759
at that point so just to keep that air

851
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,038
flow is to defoliate to get rid of the

852
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:05,720
um the leaves that are going to be a

853
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:07,839
problem later on um I like to defoliate

854
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,120
again that that right before flower

855
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:11,678
that's I I give them a a really big

856
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:14,839
stripping but I'm actually doing it

857
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,639
throughout the whole grow I'm trying to

858
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:20,599
prevent those microclimates from showing

859
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:22,678
up and um you know I've never I've never

860
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:25,719
had an issue with powdery mildew thank

861
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:28,960
goodness but uh that's something I

862
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,319
because I live in a lake um

863
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,360
there's a lot of moisture in the air and

864
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:34,638
uh we have a lot of foliage there's a

865
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:36,839
lot of green in the air so it's

866
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:40,000
something I try to prevent as much as

867
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:43,638
possible and defoliating uh keeping a

868
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,558
clean airflow canopy is is the way to do

869
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:48,038
it I'm just like you yeah late veg

870
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,839
really before flipping to flower I'm

871
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:52,720
doing pretty heavy defoliation and then

872
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:54,480
I do that flip and then within the first

873
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,919
three weeks that stretch period foliage

874
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,240
is still continuing to grow so often

875
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:02,679
times I am pling off leaves looking to

876
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:05,278
pluck them off day 7 14 21 those are

877
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:07,159
roughly the days where I typically am

878
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:08,440
just looking at the plant saying hey is

879
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:09,960
there anything that needs to be removed

880
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,440
at this point try to make sure there's

881
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,199
air flow going through the canopy making

882
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,559
sure there's not if there's stagnant

883
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:18,918
spots within the canopy that's a good

884
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:21,559
area for pest to congregate right it's

885
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:23,638
like y there's no we don't leave room

886
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:26,078
for those pests to party there's no

887
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:28,919
partying in our

888
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,760
tents and then sometimes what I'll do is

889
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:32,878
and it it's genetic dependent right cuz

890
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,520
some strains are going to be more

891
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:37,918
bushier than others so sometimes I might

892
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:40,239
they like 45 in flower and I'm like you

893
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,638
know what I can pluck off some leaves at

894
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,519
this point and get some light to come

895
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,159
more down into the canopy to touch some

896
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:49,679
of those Bud sights there so that's kind

897
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,320
of how I personally go about defoliation

898
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,480
pretty similar to you yeah I like to go

899
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,440
from the top as well uh a lot of people

900
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,079
look from the the bottom up but

901
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,039
sometimes if you just put your head over

902
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,000
top of the canopy and just pretend

903
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:03,838
you're like the light looking down and

904
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,320
think okay where can I get where can I

905
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:08,440
get some some area and it could just be

906
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,400
one or two leaves that's all you need

907
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:14,000
and you've just maximized your growth

908
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,400
yep absolutely how about the scrog

909
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,039
technique have you ever done that before

910
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,039
I've tried but it's so

911
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,760
frustrating I I like I like to move my

912
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,160
plants around and and to be able to

913
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,480
shift things around

914
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,799
and and to have things stuck in one spot

915
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,838
it's it's a little difficult for me I I

916
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:40,119
I I have tried but it's just not my it's

917
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:42,960
just not my thing I just nope I can't do

918
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:45,320
it yeah it's it can have its own unique

919
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,960
challenges that is for sure uh for those

920
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,680
folks that don't know what scrug is it's

921
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,199
basically just putting a net into your

922
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:52,838
grow space flat across your grow space

923
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,358
and then training your plants within

924
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:57,799
that net and some people will weave

925
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:59,920
branches in and out of the net other

926
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,440
would just tuck under the net entirely

927
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,400
keep tucking keep tucking all the way

928
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,318
into flower some people stop doing the

929
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,880
tucking at like day seven a flow some

930
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:11,440
people stop that day 14 of flour so

931
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,680
there's it's really subjective on when

932
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,639
you stop talking but after that you just

933
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:18,480
get the upwards growth and the idea is

934
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:21,159
that you filled up that net entirely

935
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,119
kind of maximizing the growth space and

936
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:25,159
you're resulting really in an even

937
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,400
canopy yeah it's something I've tried a

938
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:29,799
couple times in the past I'm just I'm

939
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,440
not a yield guy anymore you know when I

940
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,079
first started growing sure I was going

941
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,358
for yield and measuring things out and

942
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:36,519
and trying to get higher and higher

943
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,838
yield but I'm just growing for myself

944
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:39,358
now I mean I have friends and family

945
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:42,480
that come into town so I don't really

946
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:44,799
need yield I can just get what I'm

947
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,519
looking for just GR in the plants with

948
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,680
regular training other other types of

949
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:50,639
training I should say and so um it's

950
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:52,440
something I kind of shied away for

951
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:54,838
although there are definitely several

952
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,240
good benefits one of the main ones being

953
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:59,159
is a higher yield doing the scrug

954
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:01,078
techniqu so yeah there's a different way

955
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:04,239
to go about it and that's the beauty is

956
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:07,079
each person um you know has their own

957
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:08,559
way of gardening I mean Troy kills it

958
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,318
Northern scroger kills it with the

959
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,039
scrags you know that's his thing that's

960
00:37:11,318 --> 00:37:15,039
you

961
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:16,920
know it's that's what works for him and

962
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:19,318
I'm sure he's tried other methods to

963
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,119
find what works for him so each person

964
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:23,119
that's why that's it's so wonderful that

965
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,200
we have such a an amazing Community

966
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,838
right now that we can talk about all our

967
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:29,919
different methods so you can can find

968
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:31,159
what works for you you know and you can

969
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,079
take a little piece from here and a

970
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:36,000
little piece from there and and build

971
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:38,039
your own it's oh just amazing that we

972
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,318
have this platform yeah it's so

973
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:41,318
beneficial to be able to see all the

974
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:42,519
different ways to do it and and kind of

975
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:44,880
picking and choosing what you want to

976
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:46,838
implement in your own garden and and a

977
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,760
big shout out to Troy Northern scroger I

978
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:51,199
mean he is really we can consider him an

979
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,319
expert at this point at the scrog

980
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:56,960
technique he he literally has a show

981
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:59,199
called scrog school he's teaching step

982
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,639
byep how to do the scrog technique so if

983
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:02,879
anybody's interested in that and happen

984
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:04,960
to not know who Troy is or no than

985
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,200
scroger just search for him on YouTube

986
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,280
you'll come up with the scrog school and

987
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:13,480
um it's really really detailed class on

988
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,560
how to scrog and he is a really really

989
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:19,318
great result and even if even if you

990
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:22,400
don't are not interested in scrogging he

991
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:25,318
has a way of teaching about the plant

992
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,639
that is just so captivating it's you

993
00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:30,159
know it just if you're not interested

994
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:35,239
scrogging even just learn learn from him

995
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:40,039
about the plant it's just bow down to

996
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:44,358
try so yeah scrog technique s c o stands

997
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:47,279
for screen of green there's also sogg s

998
00:38:44,358 --> 00:38:49,838
OG SE of green have you ever done that

999
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,359
method before I have in the past and

1000
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:57,599
that's that's a lot of fun uh you just

1001
00:38:52,358 --> 00:39:00,358
take a a bunch of small plants and you

1002
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,440
fill up as much as the canopy as

1003
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:04,078
possible you have to be careful with

1004
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,920
that one though because sometimes you

1005
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,440
know they start off little you forget

1006
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,680
that they can double or triple in flower

1007
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,880
so you have to make sure you leave

1008
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:16,118
enough room room to groove in there so I

1009
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:20,880
believe the uh the rule of thumb is 50%

1010
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:23,880
so you cover 50% in uh your veg plants

1011
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,640
so then your your floor space in veg

1012
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,440
plants so then by the time that they

1013
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:33,400
grow and they they Bloom they will be

1014
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:35,400
100% in your in your canopy and uh I

1015
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,760
find it's a lot of work I like to I like

1016
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,800
to grow big plants myself but I have

1017
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,599
tried it before for fun and uh you can

1018
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,079
get a lot of flavors in one small tent

1019
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,200
that's a method that I actually haven't

1020
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:48,640
tried out should put it on my bucket

1021
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:50,759
list to try out in the future though

1022
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:52,759
that's for sure it's super interesting

1023
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,160
to me I mean it it just seems like such

1024
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:58,000
a cool technique does seem like a lot of

1025
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:59,480
work if you're handw watering but if

1026
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,318
you're doing like an EB and flow system

1027
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,800
like you've got I'm sure it makes things

1028
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:06,480
a lot easier and um I think you get the

1029
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,839
best result if you're do it from clone

1030
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,639
right because they're all kind of the

1031
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:12,440
same you know coming from the same

1032
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:14,960
mother plant and you should see similar

1033
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,318
growth across all the plants versus if

1034
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,800
you're growing from seed or even

1035
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:22,318
different cultivars it could kind of

1036
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,200
make things uneven as far as your canopy

1037
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:27,079
so often times it's genuinely

1038
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:29,118
recommended to be from clone all the

1039
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:32,720
same across the board another thing I

1040
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:35,680
want to ask about actually is lighting

1041
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:38,318
now uh how does this relate to training

1042
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:40,719
well some folks say that they reduce the

1043
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:43,480
amount of lighting when they're doing

1044
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:44,719
some of these training methods whether

1045
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,000
it be high stress training or low stress

1046
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:47,399
training they they're reducing it a

1047
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,519
little bit because they don't they want

1048
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,039
the plants to kind of recover from the

1049
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:55,119
training do you feel like the light

1050
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:57,318
output should be kind of lowered or or

1051
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,720
changed at all while you're doing plant

1052
00:40:57,318 --> 00:41:03,279
training I don't adjust my lighting for

1053
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:05,279
the training um unless I can see my if

1054
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,000
my girls are stressed and they are not

1055
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,400
bouncing back from the training then I

1056
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,800
will adjust the lighting and I'll give

1057
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,920
them a cloudy day I'll I'll I'll lower

1058
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,960
that lighting and and give them but you

1059
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,400
know the sun doesn't the sun doesn't uh

1060
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,519
stop shining because the wind is blowing

1061
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,838
right these these girls have got

1062
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:26,239
to if they're in my garden they better

1063
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:28,519
stand up

1064
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:31,639
so you know if you're not strong you're

1065
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:34,000
out it's like Spartan

1066
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:35,920
here yeah so the only time I would

1067
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,760
adjust the lighting for training is if I

1068
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,519
saw I I went too hard and they were not

1069
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,800
bouncing back so then I will lower the

1070
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:44,400
lighting a little bit and give them a

1071
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,400
cloudy day and until I see that that

1072
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,639
they're get get their footing again and

1073
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,039
then bring them back up again got it now

1074
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:52,239
what about the temperature and humidity

1075
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:53,679
are you doing anything differently in

1076
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:57,039
the environments where you're training

1077
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:59,960
plants versus not training plants or no

1078
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:01,838
no everything's I I just keep everything

1079
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,880
um I have everything all dialed in it

1080
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:05,519
just stays there I don't I once I have

1081
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,000
it dialed in I don't like to fuss and M

1082
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:08,838
with things because that's when problems

1083
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,719
happen you know you you'll adjust

1084
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:12,719
something and then do something else and

1085
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:14,959
then you you can't figure out where what

1086
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:17,239
happened and and where the problem arise

1087
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,559
so I try and keep everything as simple

1088
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:24,159
as possible and uh so everything just

1089
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:27,480
stays the same and I I adjust the

1090
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:29,159
humidity and stuff for flour and vet

1091
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,679
that's the only two times I change what

1092
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:32,639
do you typically aim for for temperature

1093
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:34,919
and humidity throughout the grow cycle

1094
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:40,558
uh during a veg I like to keep it at

1095
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:43,280
about um 80 75 to 80% humidity um I'm

1096
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,760
going to talk in uh Celsius because I am

1097
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,720
Canadian so I don't know what the

1098
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,559
conversion is but I like to keep it

1099
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:52,000
around uh 26 to

1100
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:56,000
27° in the in the

1101
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,679
tent uh so not not too hot but nice a

1102
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,559
nice summer day I like to keep it a nice

1103
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:04,519
summer day nice balmy spring summer

1104
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:07,760
day and then for flower I I keep the

1105
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:11,000
same temperature and then I bring my

1106
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:13,640
humidity down to about 50% got it and

1107
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:19,639
doing the conversion here you said 26

1108
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:22,239
which is 78.8 De and then 27° C is 80.6

1109
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:25,440
De according to google conversion here

1110
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:28,479
so for those that are in

1111
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,240
Fahrenheit awesome so I'm trying to

1112
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,920
think are there any other plant training

1113
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:32,959
methods that we didn't talk about that

1114
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,358
you'd like to

1115
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,199
discuss well I do like to do one thing

1116
00:43:36,358 --> 00:43:42,880
um to my girls that uh is not very

1117
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:46,519
typical but I like to take a leaf blower

1118
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,880
to my girls and I have an indoor Leaf

1119
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:51,639
well it's not an indoor it's an outdoor

1120
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:54,960
leaf blower but I have it indoors I in

1121
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:58,279
in my setup and I take the leaf blower

1122
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,800
and I actually have this part of my IPM

1123
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,200
it's part of my IPM and it's part

1124
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,599
training both I will take my leaf blower

1125
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:08,960
and I will blow the tent and these girls

1126
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:12,720
are swaying and moving and it's like a

1127
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:16,079
like a hurricane in the in the tent and

1128
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:19,118
uh the girls always respond with a thank

1129
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,359
