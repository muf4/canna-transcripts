00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,719
book I ever bought I started growing

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,959
back in 2010 and I was I think a year

71
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:40,120
into it I ended up buying that book and

72
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,840
it was my go-to guide for so many years

73
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,599

you on here today to talk about a

76
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,400
variety of different things but first

77
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,759
before we get too deep into those things

78
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,000
can you give us a little introduction

79
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,518
tell us a little bit about yourself and

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,199
kind of how you got into gardening yeah

81
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,680
let's see um actually I've always liked

82
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,079
gardening i' since I was a little kid I

83
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,480
like like gardening I was the only one

84
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,000
of my family that like gardening uh you

85
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:08,598
know little kids they grow uh two two

86
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,519
crops that all little kids grow radishes

87
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:14,878
cuz they're so fast like those little uh

88
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,239
all the little red ones

89
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,399
so oh what the heck do they call I can't

90
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,920
remember what they call them but they're

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,879
really fast they they're like 28

92
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:27,039
days and then the other one that all

93
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:30,759
little kids grow is corn corn uh sweet

94
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:34,560
corn because it's a C4 crap uh plant and

95
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:37,479
C4 means it it uh well most plants are

96
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,759
uh C3 which means they fix carbon you

97
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:43,280
know but C4 that means they grow faster

98
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:45,560
so um yeah it's it's one of those plants

99
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,878
that grows fast and you know I mean

100
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,878
it'll grow taller than you as a little

101
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:55,000
kid so it's pretty cool um yeah so I

102
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:58,560
started started with that and then when

103
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,799
when cannabis um came out I I just got

104
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,680
really interested in it and I lived in

105
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,719
Southern California and started growing

106
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,799
in the Hills behind uh Santa Barbara

107
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,919
little town right next to it called Mono

108
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,560
that means little little mountain in

109
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:18,079
Spanish and since then they've had like

110
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,600
mud mud slides and stuff but anyway I I

111
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,560
started a long time ago I wrote this

112
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,280
book here and nobody had published it

113
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,360
nobody they didn't want to nobody would

114
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:31,719
even print it so I had to print the book

115
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,759
myself I did all my own artwork it's

116
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,039
it's pretty pretty limited artwork but

117
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:40,800
and then there's I had a few photos but

118
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:42,680
all the photos were black and white see

119
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,000
um but that's all I could afford the

120
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:49,280
book sold is 96 pages sold for

121
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
$88.95 and I printed the the book myself

122
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:56,519
first year this thing sold 6,000 copies

123
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,319

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,759
early on and um I was made it through

167
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,478
that's when it was really expensive to

168
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,280
produce videos and stuff and so there

169
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:16,439
wasn't a lot of information out there

170
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:18,959
and the production values were well much

171
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:23,319
different than they are today so what

172
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:25,560
happened was um anyway I got uh these

173
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,479
videos went all over the world I mean I

174
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,199
I mean I literally had millions and

175
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:33,878
millions of views of the these and then

176
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:36,400
I started making my own um I made about

177
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:40,599
300 videos I guess yeah I do garden

178
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:44,638
tours and yeah garden tours and you know

179
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:46,918
um backyard stuff I had uh like what

180
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,319
three or four different garden beds that

181
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:53,639
were full of full of different varieties

182
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:56,598
of of plants and stuff and yeah I just

183
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:59,960
go through and did that but I I started

184
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:03,800
about God five five decades ago

185
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:06,959
like in the 80s early 80s and that was

186
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,840
my public life this book here came out

187
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:13,038
in

188
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:16,239
1983 and then after

189
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:18,800
that yeah gosh I mean it's it's been a

190
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,680
heck of a long career it's been more

191
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,639
than 40 years yeah well 42 years now 42

192
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,959

193
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:32,200
know I've traveled a lot I've spent a

194
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:35,079
lot of time in Europe um well I moved

195
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,479
moved here I've been here like

196
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:41,240
officially like yeah about 25 years so

197
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,480
over a third of my life has been here

198
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,519
spent a lot of time in or a bit not tons

199
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,800

haven't haven't spent any time in a in

203
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:02,559
Africa was was in Japan like like that

204
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:06,440
one book of mine Japanese where the heck

205
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:09,559
ever it is yeah so anyway I've done done

206
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:15,079
a lot and then I had to deal a lot

207
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:17,479
with uh this subject of Cu see these two

208
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:23,639
books are actually pretty much the same

209
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:26,800
book one of them is is is uh about a

210
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:30,240
specific plant and the other ones about

211
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:33,639
all kinds of different plants but this

212
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,959
is uh this book sold very very well for

213
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:40,838
many years until till life changed in

214
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:45,479
the United States let's put it that way

215
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:47,360
in the uh late 990s yeah yeah so that's

216
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,360
a little bit of background like I say

217
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,079
I've been at this a long time I know a

218
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:57,839
lot of people um and probably more

219
00:09:53,078 --> 00:10:00,958
people know me I used to used to wear a

220
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,480
disguise yeah I used to wear a disguise

221
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:06,278
let's see

222
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:09,079
that uh well there's a little car of

223
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:11,360
this one of me in Disguise

224
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:14,919
here where I wear

225
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,039
dreadlocks maybe no I guess there's oh

226
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:22,958
yeah there's another book here that I

227
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:26,000
was in a disguise but I I just don't

228
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:28,239
always oh yeah there's Russian books oh

229
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,559
yeah here's here's some more disguises

230
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:35,320
of me this is me in the the videos I

231
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:38,838
wore the disguise because well back then

232
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:43,240
times were definitely different but what

233
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:45,560
was the the deal was uh there was no no

234
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,759
internet so it was really easy I could I

235
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:51,000
could go across borders and everything

236
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:54,120
all I had to do was look differently and

237
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,679
um it sure sure helped a lot it helped a

238
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,639
heck of a lot now it doesn't help at all

239
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,359
they just run my name either way any

240
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:05,399
name I want to put out out there they

241
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:08,440
just run that yeah they know who I

242
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:11,200
am but anyway I I've certainly seen a

243
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:15,720
lot of change I've seen patterns happen

244
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:18,320
you know uh yeah but lots of change and

245
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,240
uh that's probably the biggest thing

246
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,160
I've seen is Chang and there's way more

247
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:28,039
information about indoor cultivation now

248
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:31,480
way more than there used to be and we

249
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:34,439
know a lot more about lights and in

250
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,560
general uh well yeah indoor lighting

251
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,040
definitely incredible you have done so

252
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:41,119
much good work over the years uh you

253
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,240
mentioned yeah it was 1983 was your

254
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,440
first book that was actually two years

255
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,000
before I was

256
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,959
born you've been at it for a very long

257
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,120
time and you really paved the way for

258
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:55,518
not just an access of the information

259
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,639
but also for other content creators to

260
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,240
put themselves out there your DVD is

261
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,039
still on Amazon today so somebody could

262
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,440
actually look that up and watch it and I

263
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,078
actually watched it about a handful of

264
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,519
years ago and I just brought back some

265
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:11,120
memories you know what I mean yeah yeah

266
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:14,399
you can probably find it you know High

267
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,959
Times is they're they're I don't know

268
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,399
what you'd call it if they're in

269
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:20,319
receivership or whatever it is but that

270
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,240
they're in big trouble with the Federal

271
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,240
Trade Commission and stuff so I don't

272
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,560
know really who who's in charge of of

273
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,278
the asset there that that would be a

274
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:34,759
property you know all of these they they

275
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:38,720
own the rights to to to these

276
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:41,000
videos um so I don't know what the story

277
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,000
is there uh but you can probably find

278
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,759
them on on the internet I know they

279
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,519
wouldn't let me put them on my site and

280
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:48,759
I kind of kind of pissed me off a bit

281
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,720
you know I

282
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:55,319
mean I certainly made them a lot of

283
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,320
money you oh I can imagine yeah I can

284
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,399
imagine how much but yeah your content

285
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,519
has definitely been exposed all over the

286
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,078
world and so many people have gotten

287
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,278
value and learned how to grow medicinal

288
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:08,439
plants because of you so it's really

289
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:10,198
awesome what you did and you're you're

290
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,600
still going which is really really

291
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:14,639
inspiring to see now on this podcast I

292
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,040
do have a variety of viewers I've got

293
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,039
folks that are beginners some folks that

294
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:19,639
are intermediate probably a smaller

295
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:21,319
amount of advanced Growers but I feel

296
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,799
like mostly it's beginners and

297
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,120
intermediate Growers so I'm going to go

298
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:28,000
into some questions here and really this

299
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,839
podcast is kind of to get information

300
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
about like Hands-On stuff

301
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,160
and some of the stuff there some of

302
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,360
these questions that I have which I've

303
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,319
given you in advance it's really goes

304
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,360
off of things that were in your book I I

305
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,680
would kind of want to get a little bit

306
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,600
deeper into or clarification so the

307
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,039
first one I want to jump into has to do

308
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,278
with the 24-hour light cycle so a lot of

309
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:48,319
folks are just giving when they're

310
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:50,919
growing indoors they're just giving 24

311
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,560
hours of straight light and no hours of

312
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:56,559
darkness my question for you is is that

313
00:13:53,559 --> 00:14:00,319
optimal do plants need a rest period at

314
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:03,399
all yeah they do actually uh you can

315
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,079
hype them up like that but what happens

316
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:08,440
here here's the deal it's just it's it's

317
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:10,359
real similar to people or animals like a

318
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,600
horse for example you ride that horse

319
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,720
too too long he's lathered up he I mean

320
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,560
maybe he can keep going but he going to

321
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,040
fall over dead you know I mean he's not

322
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:23,078
going to work too hard same with the dog

323
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:25,799
same with the person you know you can

324
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:28,479
only take so much if it gets too hot

325
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:31,639
outside you can't handle it your body's

326
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,360
got to rest and recover and that's when

327
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:38,639
the growth and and everything takes

328
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:41,039
place well when you got when you got uh

329
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:45,600
you you push the heck out of everything

330
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:48,078
uh plants people animals uh what happens

331
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,600
is especially in in Plants this the

332
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:52,719
cells aren't as strong they got weaker

333
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,000
walls you know it's just like not as

334
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,519
strong it's just a little bit narrower

335
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,399
and so everything is just like not as

336
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:05,519
strong not as strong so

337
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,039
um that happens that that's the first

338
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,480
thing it doesn't have time to catch up

339
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:13,679
and grow and and metabolize everything

340
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,039
cuz see they they've been growing

341
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:18,919
outside for like millions of years right

342
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:22,319
millions of years and they're used to

343
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:25,078
this regular schedule and anybody that's

344
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,680
grown very much at all any kind of

345
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:29,439
plants knows that you know the last

346
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,318
thing you want to do is uproot that

347
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:36,120
plant or change that plant schedule

348
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:39,599
because it likes a regular schedule so

349
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:44,078
yeah yeah it definitely definitely needs

350
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:46,959
a uh a downtime and you're not going to

351
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,719
make it grow any faster you know I I

352
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,758
talk to a lot of people

353
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,560
like some guys are are mechanics you

354
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:59,000
know that are into growing indoors and

355
00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:02,039
they liken everything to an internal

356
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,600
combustion engine and it's not the same

357
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:06,719
thing they just don't work the same way

358
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,920
you know you got a lot more variables

359
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,879
here and you got soft tissue uh you know

360
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:17,000
you don't you you you you you've got

361
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:19,439
water not rather than than oil you know

362
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,399
uh complete different

363
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,519
values so yeah it's it's important it's

364
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,480
important mainly the the thing

365
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:31,198
especially new people you want to follow

366
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,639
what mother Nature's doing and it works

367
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:36,039
works every time or

368
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:38,560
usually good to know yeah I personally

369
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:40,879
go after the 186 light cycle for the veg

370
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,119
stage to give some rest period but I do

371
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,799
know a handful of folks that U strive

372
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,120
for the 24 hours of of light and so I

373
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:49,120
was just curious on uh yeah because

374
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,679
there's a lot of people that say that

375
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,560
it's perfectly fine and that plants

376
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:55,399
don't need a rest period others say they

377
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,198
do so yeah I'm happy that you uh

378
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,278
revealed some stuff for us here yeah

379
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:01,078
science says

380
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:04,798
that that there's a lot of chemistry

381
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:06,558
that goes on during that time got it now

382
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,519
one of the things that's in your book

383
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,879
which I wanted to bring up was talking

384
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:13,400
about the sex of the plant and how

385
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,400
environmental factors can influence it

386
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,759
so for example it says something things

387
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,519
like increased nitrogen for more females

388
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:23,279
lower pottassium for females lower temps

389
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:25,838
for male plants lower humidity for male

390
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,359
plants more blue light for female plants

391
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:31,440
is all that stuff still accurate today

392
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:33,159
yes yeah very much so very much so and

393
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,798
those are for and that's that's for

394
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:39,519
regular plants and basically all you're

395
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:44,119
doing is making um uh stacking the the

396
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:47,119
deck in favor of of more female plants

397
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:48,558
so basically you just you make a nice

398
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,719
life for the plant and they're going to

399
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:54,558
make more female plants you know another

400
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,400
what another dious plant the Holly for

401
00:17:54,558 --> 00:18:01,279
example that's another dious one you

402
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,720
know um what's another one kiwis kiwis

403
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:06,359
is another one you know those are

404
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,880
perennials yeah okay got it yeah I know

405
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:10,558
there are testing facilities you can

406
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,320
actually send out take a sample of it

407
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,119
when it's a Seedling and send it out for

408
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:17,399
DNA sex testing so I wasn't aware that

409
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,918
you could actually get it tested and

410
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,640
then they could say it's female but if

411
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,960
you're vegging it wrong right if you're

412
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,840
two low of temps for example it could

413
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,079
increase your chances of males just look

414
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,798
at the list here longer days 18 plus

415
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:33,480
hours of light says more males so that

416
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:35,240
was a pretty surprising thing to me I

417
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,919
fig I'd just touch base and figure out

418
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,240
if that was still true or not yeah yeah

419
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,919
it's really interesting because you know

420
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,759
with the sex there's a lot of especially

421
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:48,159
lower animals and snails and worms and

422
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,440
stuff they change sex back and forth you

423
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:55,480
know from male to female or they'll be

424
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:58,200
both sexes yeah it's uh and plants too

425
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,120
it's it's like that yeah higher higher

426
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,000
things they tend to have it sorted out a

427
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:05,798
little bit better but not

428
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,038
always that's interesting so another

429
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:10,240
thing it says in your book it says that

430
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:14,960
medicinal plants virtually stop growing

431
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:18,120
at 85° F which is 25° C now is that just

432
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,159
certain genetics or all genetics will

433
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:23,719
CO2 supplementation allow the plant to

434
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:26,240
grow at those higher temps boy I'll tell

435
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,400
you you know when when I wrote when I

436
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,960
wrote that I was mainly talking about

437
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,159
well talking about the indoor indoor

438
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,798
plants and stuff and with outdoor plants

439
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:41,559
man you can push those a lot a lot more

440
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:44,038
and on some stuff I I just was you know

441
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:46,759
uh I either I didn't qualify stuff or I

442
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:49,119
was just playing wrong you know on stuff

443
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:52,000
but you look at you look at an outdoor

444
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:54,678
plant uh one that's planted in the in

445
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,599
the earth that was planted early on and

446
00:19:54,679 --> 00:20:01,280
it's got a real deep tap route that

447
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:05,480
thing that I mean it can take a lot of

448
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:08,038
abuse a heck of a lot of abuse and uh

449
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,159
it's got a heck of a good water source

450
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:14,279
already and it's getting from very deep

451
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:16,600
and uh it's got tons lots of foliage on

452
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:21,480
it that it can also use to shade the

453
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:24,079
other other plants and if it's got a a

454
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,400
like ton like a real good source of

455
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:29,960
water and it's got a good root system it

456
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:33,280
can it can take way higher temperatures

457
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,400
than that as far as like the upper end I

458
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:39,599
couldn't tell you for sure cuz you

459
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,600
mentioned varieties earlier or strains

460
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:46,480
earlier that makes a huge difference

461
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:50,038
because see there's plants I know I

462
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:53,558
remember my friend God so many people

463
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:57,200
are dead now Felix is gone a Swiss guy

464
00:20:53,558 --> 00:21:00,038
lived in tachino in the South part Pera

465
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:04,360
but he he he was growing what do you

466
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:07,679
call a per per perana tenses yeah from

467
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:13,399
teino teino tenses yeah he named you

468
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:16,519
gave it a Latin name U purple from toino

469
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,600
but it could take a freeze you could it

470
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:23,720
could handle a freeze and it could take

471
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:27,240
a freeze down to about like 20 25 26°

472
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:30,159
fah for a couple of nights uh you go

473
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,120
past three nights and would have trouble

474
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,919
but that that's that's definitely a

475
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:39,278
genetic characteristic you know

476
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:42,240
um it's big and and the same same for

477
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:45,240
heat CU if you look

478
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,759
at if you look at leaves it's so simple

479
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,558
it's it's real physical you look at the

480
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,038
the leaves the indicia leaves you know

481
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,440
where they grow and they're cooler in

482
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:56,960
the mountains they're wide they're

483
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,919
they're broad broad Lea because that way

484
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,079
they they they need that to gather more

485
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:03,960
sunlight and everything but you look at

486
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:07,599
the plants that get that get really

487
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:11,120
really high sun in the tropics they have

488
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:13,959
a narrow Leaf narrow Leaf you know and

489
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:16,479
so that's so it'll dissipate heat faster

490
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,600
you know it's it's all a function so

491
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,798
they they um they acclimate to all of

492
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:25,639
these all of these things

493
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:29,558
so we just got to really learn a hell of

494
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:33,080
a lot more than we know of about this

495
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:36,599
plant and and other plants too as far as

496
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:39,000
their specific tolerances go because we

497
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:41,240
we just don't know and a lot of times

498
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,038
people try to get you to say well I want

499
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:48,960
a general statement that's true for

500
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:52,480
everybody it's like well no like I'm

501
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,200
it's like saying I will cure cancer okay

502
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,519
which one which cancer will you cure

503
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:02,919
there's many types of cancer and

504
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,519
you can't just say I'm going to make a

505
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:06,600
or you can't just make General

506
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:08,240
statements because we really just don't

507
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:10,959
know

508
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,919
enough yeah there are so many variables

509
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,120
when it comes to Growing these plants

510
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:16,480
and science hasn't uncovered everything

511
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:17,719
when it comes to it and that's I think

512
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,079
one of the things that makes it so

513
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,720
exciting to be in this space is that

514
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:24,240
more and more things are being uncovered

515
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,519
it seems like almost every day every

516
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,798
week there's some new information coming

517
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:30,599
out there's studies being done on

518
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,519
different aspects of the plant and it

519
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:35,000
just really makes things more exciting

520
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:38,440
and fun to uh to grow these plants in my

521
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,359
opinion yeah 100%

522
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,400
100% I'm pretty

523
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:47,558
excited you know I'm like I stay with

524
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:50,798
this uh with this uh well life I mean

525
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:53,399
I'm I'm like 7 71 years old right so

526
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:55,240
like old guy now and I just don't know

527
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,960
anything different you know and it's

528
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,880
kept me entertained all this time so

529
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,558
so I think I think uh there's going to

530
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,720
be a lot of other people like this too

531
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:07,119
it certainly kept you entertained

532
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,519
absolutely for sure I want to talk about

533
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:12,038
clones next particularly taking clones

534
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:13,599
what part of the plant to take it in

535
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:15,640
there are a lot of folks that say the

536
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,558
top of the plant's the best some say no

537
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,720
the middle of the plant is best others

538
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:21,359
say the bottom part of the plant is best

539
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,600
what's your take on that what's the best

540
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,839
part of the plant to take clones from

541
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:27,359
okay when I first when I when I wrote

542
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:30,278
wrote that

543
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:33,038
uh did that did that research there what

544
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:35,960
was it said uh said they they wanted a

545
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:38,599
lot of cellulos cellulos stiff

546
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:41,679
cellulose that's that and I read that

547
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:46,119
several times and then I remember I was

548
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:50,919
over in in a uh Austria

549
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:53,719
Austria and I did uh a bit a video

550
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:57,038
actually a bunch of videos over there at

551
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,600
flowery field cuz see over there they

552
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:02,000
can grow they can grow clones and sell

553
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:07,959
them but they're not supposed to flower

554
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:10,319
them so you know my my buddy U Alex uh

555
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,079
his last name broke wall yeah he has

556
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,678
flowery Fields well he's a lawyer and he

557
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:19,000
figured the law out and he's figured he

558
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:21,840
figured it out about 15 years ago so

559
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,200
he's been making like literally hundreds

560
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:28,119
and thousands of clones every year since

561
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,000
then yeah so he's been very very helpful

562
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:34,439
but but those guys uh they had some

563
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,480
basic rules and that was uh you have as

564
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,440
many budding sites as possible or as

565
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,200
many branches as possible and they were

566
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,679
taking all the Clones off the top of the

567
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:49,319
plants where where they basically have a

568
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:52,278
high concentration of of um nitrogen and

569
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:55,158
that's just exactly against everything

570
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:57,720
there that that I read that I that I

571
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:59,799
thought I believe but it works great and

572
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,798
I've seen so many people do it since

573
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:05,278
then um so it really doesn't matter

574
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:08,918
where you take the clones from as long

575
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:11,558
as the plants healthy and growing and

576
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:13,880
healthy I got to qualify that because a

577
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:16,000
lot of times they could have uh what do

578
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,278
you call that powdery mildew inside and

579
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,119
you can't tell uh they could have some

580
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:21,798
kind of a systemic problem so that

581
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:24,798
that's incredibly important to keep your

582
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:28,599
plants clean and keep them keep them uh

583
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:31,200
sterile uh super important and then

584
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:35,558
another thing cuz see Alex really

585
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:38,080
impressed me a lot uh he doesn't keep

586
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:41,558
his plant his mother plants for more

587
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:44,398
than 6 months and he says 6 months is

588
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:47,798
about the uh the end of a productive

589
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:51,719
life for the the females and they do

590
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:56,240
real well during that time and they also

591
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:59,759
he also grows them in um uh what do you

592
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:03,200
call those the uh containers that are

593
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:06,119
self pruning yeah air air air pruning

594
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,960
containers yeah root pruning

595
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:12,199
containers and U yeah and keeps them

596
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:15,840
growing fast cranked up all the time so

597
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,759
yeah yeah but like I said doesn't bother

598
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:19,678
me to admit I'm wrong you know I mean if

599
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,519
somebody got better information fine

600
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,840
let's see it yeah I personally had take

601
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:26,359
clones from taken from all parts of the

602
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:29,038
planet I haven't had a problem with

603
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:32,759
rooting so I'm glad that you uh that you

604
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:36,398
mentioned that sure and you know um

605
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:38,679
usually for well for for clones uh the

606
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:40,959
one of the big tricks for for taking

607
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:43,600
clones is you have that uh have that

608
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,519
soil or your substrate just a a few

609
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:48,879
degrees warmer than the than the uh the

610
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:51,960
air temperature and that'll usually

611
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,799
stick your your roots a little faster

612
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,840
that that in the air but there's lots of

613
00:27:54,798 --> 00:28:00,038
information on that now that's good to

614
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:01,639
know that's question I have is also from

615
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:03,839
your book I think it's going to shock a

616
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,000
lot of folks one of the common things

617
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:09,519
that folks do is they'll do def some

618
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,558
sort of defoliation a pruning of leaves

619
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:14,159
prior to flipping to the flowering stage

620
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:16,319
now in your book as mentions avoid

621
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,880
pruning up to a month before inducing

622
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:21,759
flowering since pruning diffuses floral

623
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,679
hormones flowering is slowed down if

624
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,720
heavy prune before flowering Peak

625
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,679
maturation is delayed for a week or

626
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,360
longer and it takes a month or longer

627
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,640
for hor hormones to build up to

628
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:34,038
pre-pruning concentrations I thought

629
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,679
this was super super interesting cuz

630
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:38,480
this people go against this quite often

631
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:41,240
now first of all is this still true to

632
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,200
today yeah well I'll tell you I've just

633
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:49,000
there was one study one study that I

634
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:52,519
that I read uh that that promoted uh

635
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,839
pruning indoor plants that were grown

636
00:28:52,519 --> 00:29:00,120
indoors and that it proved that they got

637
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:03,359
like I don't know 10 12% more Harvest I

638
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:05,918
believe it was and I didn't I I I went

639
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:08,278
to look up to study before I uh the

640
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,720
program before the podcast and I

641
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:13,640
couldn't find it but that's the only

642
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,038
study that I could find and a lot of the

643
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:21,519
other information that I've gotten has

644
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:26,000
been um uh oh hearsay information or

645
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:29,960
anecdotal information no side by side uh

646
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,319
study that's that's really fir worm and

647
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,759
so that's that's why I said that and

648
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:37,278
then for outdoor plants definitely don't

649
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:38,398
prune them I mean I don't see any any

650
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:42,319
benefit

651
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:45,439
whatsoever and especially gosh

652
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:49,158
well if you look at this as far as

653
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,798
pruning goes or well pruning uh removing

654
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:55,679
the shade leaves because that's what it

655
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:57,639
is pruning trimming um they have

656
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,278
different meanings but removing the

657
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:03,919
shade leaves which is is

658
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:06,679
specific uh those guys uh I I think a

659
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,080
lot of people have a small garden and

660
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:12,240
they get antsy and they just want to do

661
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:14,558
something so they take off the leaves

662
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,359
you know and then I also see a lot of

663
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:19,639
people do this uh lollipopping they call

664
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,759
it where they take up all the leaves off

665
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,960
the b or all the leaves off the bottom

666
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:27,319
of the plant and I think that's crazy

667
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,319
because you already paid for all of that

668
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:31,759
light to grow those plants and then then

669
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:34,720
you're going to go and cut those

670
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:36,398
branches off it doesn't make much sense

671
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,519
now if you've got some really weak

672
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:41,359
growth down there sure cut that Branch

673
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:43,558
off fine but taking it off as a matter

674
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:46,079
of fact no I'd be growing all the way

675
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:48,000
all the way down to the bottom you know

676
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:51,240
the bottom of

677
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,599
the the ground you know it just it it

678
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,839
makes more sense cuz you know it's it's

679
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:58,319
just a waste like I say the light's been

680
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:00,000
spent the fertilizer been spent

681
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,599
everything's been spent but mainly it's

682
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,440
the time so you've got like 3 weeks of

683
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:07,638
time that you're not getting any benefit

684
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:12,798
from if you've done anything you've

685
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:15,398
wasted that time um yeah so I I I I

686
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:18,398
don't know I mean I just can't I can't

687
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:21,398
find any good information I and and I'm

688
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:24,479
hoping that people here will will put

689
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:26,759
these studies down because normally what

690
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,120
happens is people go well I do it it

691
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:31,679
works for me like well so what it

692
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:34,918
doesn't tell me

693
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,559
anything uh other than it works for you

694
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:41,600
but you you haven't qualified anything

695
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:44,558
so you got to you got to make uh an

696
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:47,199
actual study on this stuff still have so

697
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:48,798
much anecdotal Bro Science that's

698
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,519
floating around people say hey it works

699
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:53,038
for me so it should work for

700
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:55,038
everybody yeah or or what kind of

701
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,638
variety was it you know what was the

702
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,919
temperatures and everything all of

703
00:31:56,638 --> 00:32:00,519
that's really important you know

704
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,759
absolutely yeah but when it comes to the

705
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,200
lollipopping I know one of the main

706
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:06,839
reasons why folks do it is they claim

707
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,558
that that lower that lower area if buds

708
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:11,480
form there it's more of like an area

709
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:13,879
structure and removing that will help

710
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,839
keep the uh the top buds Focus its

711
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,480
energy on the top buds kind of forming

712
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:18,439
and it helps with density and stuff like

713
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,038
that now I know it's Cult of our

714
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,880
dependent stuff like that but I think

715
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,679
I'd give you a heads up on why some

716
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,559
people are doing that and then as far as

717
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,120
defoliation one of the main reasons why

718
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:29,678
folks like to do it is to avoid like if

719
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:31,638
you have a real thick canopy powdery

720
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,200
mildew right so if there's like real

721
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:36,479
thick lack of air flow in there that's

722
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,919
one of the main reason just to prevent

723
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,519
powder mildew from forming so if you got

724
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:43,639
throw that one out there in case anybody

725
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:46,319
listening wasn't aware but the there the

726
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:47,839
way to solve those problems is with the

727
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,798
genetic

728
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:54,278
superiority because 100% that's the way

729
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:57,038
you do it that's that works and then

730
00:32:54,278 --> 00:32:59,200
also with the type of cultivar you're

731
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:02,519
growing you know you you you don't you

732
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,960
don't have such a tight tight compact

733
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:07,599
flowers uh cuz

734
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,240
those those will make the the the

735
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:13,119
powdery me do or they'll make the

736
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:17,919
buritis or they'll they'll make a a home

737
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:21,558
for for insects and and M you know

738
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:24,919
um yeah yeah I mean we we've got tons of

739
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:27,200
tons of uh work to do as far as as far

740
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:29,120
as breeding goes cuz you know I mean

741
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,840
another one as far as breeding goes is

742
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:34,278
the the branches aren't strong enough

743
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:38,519
for example to hold the flowers up the

744
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:44,000
flowers will pull the branches over or

745
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:46,000
or uh some some some plants or a lot of

746
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,440
plants don't have a big enough root

747
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
system for example uh that's really

748
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:56,080
important or um yeah there you know

749
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,440
disease and pest resistant is resistance

750
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:02,599
is super important as well

751
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:06,919
and as far and also uh being being

752
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:10,799
immune to like uh heat and cold problems

753
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:12,720
you know huge huge huge deals huge

754
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,000
understood now one of the things that

755
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,678
kind of relates to this a little bit was

756
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,519
talking about inducing flowering in

757
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,119
particular waiting until preflowers have

758
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:24,960
appeared so I've heard that you really

759
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,320
should wait to induce flowering or or

760
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,000
switch to that flowering light cycle

761
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,519
right wait until the profiles have

762
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,199
appeared it said that such stress you

763
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:35,639
know if you go against that could cause

764
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:38,319
strange growth plants May grow into

765
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:41,240
hermaphrodites so showing inter interex

766
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,119
traits what's your take on that yeah

767
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:47,358
100% 100% because you know like I say

768
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:49,679
the plants don't change that fast and

769
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:52,799
and when they've been growing the same

770
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,599
way for for millions of years they're

771
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,039
not going to deviate from that very fast

772
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:02,200
you know so they're going to they're

773
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:05,239
going to stay growing that way right uh

774
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:08,519
and two like I mentioned before the the

775
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:12,078
cell walls that get more uh thinner

776
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:14,920
narrower uh they're not as strong and so

777
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:19,160
there's all kinds of stuff that produce

778
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,880
produces stress and you know any kind of

779
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:23,279
and and that would be photo period

780
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,838
stress because you'd like we've got the

781
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:30,040
ability to make the the uh the plant

782
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:32,559
flower at the induce flowering uh really

783
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:34,119
quickly by you know giving it longer

784
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:37,519
nights

785
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:40,800
so you'd be stressing the plant out that

786
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:44,159
and and stress they don't like stress

787
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,640
and in general let's say you know pretty

788
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:49,679
much everybody's grown like well

789
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:52,759
radishes I mentioned radishes earlier

790
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,919
but radishes as soon as it gets hot or

791
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,240
as soon as they're stressed out at all

792
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:01,358
they always bolt they go to Sea every

793
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:05,598
time and you know like I say most people

794
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:07,239
have grown radishes so what happens any

795
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,720
time a plant gets

796
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:12,078
dressed they want to they try to

797
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:15,078
complete their life cycle and produce a

798
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:18,240
viable seed in general that's the first

799
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:20,760
thing they do so anytime you stress out

800
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:23,439
a plant any kind of a plant they're

801
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,079
going to try to complete their life

802
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,960
cycle

803
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:30,119
and they're going to want to make and

804
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,720
want to and and and try to get them

805
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:35,160
planted in the ground so they'll be

806
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:39,679
healthy next year and they'll procreate

807
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:41,679
for another year um it's just so

808
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:44,759
straightforward and simple you know and

809
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:46,480
people people that aren't really

810
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,760
experienced with gardening think they

811
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,159
can go in and change all of that well

812
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,400
it's the systems already been set up

813
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:56,318
before you got

814
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,960
here that makes sense now another thing

815
00:36:56,318 --> 00:37:00,599
I've heard talking about the amount of

816
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,358
light given to the plant or really

817
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,599
Darkness we know that when you flipped a

818
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:06,318
flower it's really the darkness period

819
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:08,880
that's going to have the plant to

820
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:11,279
produce Floren of the flowering hormone

821
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,039
does giving the plant less than 12 hours

822
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,519
of light induce any flowering FAS and

823
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:19,559
does it reduce yield yeah it reduces

824
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:23,800
yield um because there's that thing that

825
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:27,799
Daily Light integral uh it's it you got

826
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:30,280
to have so many um hours of light of a

827
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:33,920
specific spectrum and

828
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:37,640
intensity uh every 24 hours for for it

829
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,280
to to to to receive all the light it

830
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:43,318
needs to flower properly so if it

831
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:46,839
doesn't get that so if you've got if

832
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:49,239
you've got uh say it well 10 hours say

833
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:51,799
it's it's 10 hours of light yes so

834
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:55,838
you've got to stuff 10 hours or 12 hours

835
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:58,000
of light into that 10 hours right um so

836
00:37:55,838 --> 00:38:00,799
it's got you just got to give it more

837
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,199
intense light and technically that's

838
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:07,119
that's quite difficult to do so that's

839
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:11,559
that's number one and then let's see

840
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:14,838
less light less light and uh yeah so you

841
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:18,119
don't get as much light it's not as

842
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:21,000
bright yeah so your DLI goes down so you

843
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:24,760
you're definitely going to get less less

844
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,800
production guaranteed guaranteed and the

845
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:31,839
other part is we don't know this this is

846
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,519
my feeling and I believe that it goes

847
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:37,199
all the way here we

848
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:40,759
have doas what we use here in Spain it's

849
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:43,039
like the whole Spectrum or fan everybody

850
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:46,960
you have the whole fan so you can have a

851
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:49,679
plant over here that that is

852
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:53,000
autoflowering that that flowers after

853
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:54,838
like 3 weeks right okay so so that's one

854
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,159
side and then you can have a plant over

855
00:38:54,838 --> 00:39:00,679
on the other side that says one of those

856
00:38:57,159 --> 00:39:03,480
really long season sativ that really

857
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:05,559
doesn't ever quit flowering it it

858
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,358
continues so you've got this entire

859
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:12,519
Spectrum from one side to the other

860
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:16,318
complete complete um well yeah Spectrum

861
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:19,119
maybe yeah it doesn't mean light

862
00:39:16,318 --> 00:39:22,400
spectrum it means spectrum

863
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,400
of different yeah it's they're they're

864
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,160
completely different at opposite ends of

865
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:31,720
the of of the scale so I'm believe that

866
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:35,879
in between here is you've got everything

867
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:38,919
else too so with this one here you can

868
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:42,000
get uh 24 hours of light and this one

869
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:46,838
here you can have like 10 hours of light

870
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:50,199
or uh and longer longer photo period or

871
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:53,119
longer light period and longer nights

872
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:55,399
but everything in between is the same so

873
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,079
what does that mean that means you're

874
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,039
going to get plants that flower with 12

875
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:04,200
hours of light with 14 hours of light

876
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:07,599
with 10 hours of light we don't know

877
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:10,358
which ones because we don't know enough

878
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:13,039
yet and we usually and and and usually

879
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:15,920
with these plants since it's an out

880
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:17,519
breeder we don't know we don't know

881
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,200
what's

882
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:23,759
um

883
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:26,239
uh we don't know if it's stable or not

884
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,480
first it's got to be stable and then you

885
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:31,039
can measure it well there's so much

886
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,480
unstable stuff out there that that we're

887
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:35,880
not really doing our s a service of

888
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,119
making more

889
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:42,160
varieties that aren't stable so it's

890
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:44,640
kind of we go around in circles and it's

891
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:47,679
going to take some big agricultural

892
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:50,920
company to sort that stuff out actually

893
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:52,399
I think scking on the topic of light UV

894
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,960
light want to get into that a little bit

895
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,680
can you talk to us about UV light and

896
00:40:53,960 --> 00:41:02,639
how it impacts triome development yeah

897
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:05,279
the the UV the what the example best

898
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:07,159
example I have there's information there

899
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,079
probably better information than this

900
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:13,879
but in Switzerland see you you used to

901
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:18,440
be able to uh grow any plant you wanted

902
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:23,119
in Switzerland um about 20 years ago and

903
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:26,920
a friend of mine was growing uh these

904
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:31,720
plants at 900 M and he also had another

905
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:36,599
Gard at 300 M in elevation right so 300

906
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:38,919
M about 1,000 and 900 M about 3,000 so

907
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:43,240
it's quite quite a bit of difference or

908
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:49,440
4,000 so so what happened

909
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:53,439
is the ones at at uh 900 M those plants

910
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:56,358
had really heavy tricomes on it because

911
00:41:53,440 --> 00:42:00,639
they get more UV light and they would

912
00:41:56,358 --> 00:42:02,838
put and and uh then the tricomes are

913
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:05,719
there or these the capitate stock

914
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:08,759
tricomes are the ones we care about but

915
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:10,799
uh tricomes just means plant hair you

916
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,240
know so it could be any kind of a plant

917
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,640
hair and there's within that

918
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:18,598
classification there's four Bas well

919
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:21,519
there's quite a few different types but

920
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:24,960
anyway uh with more UV light there's

921
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:27,880
they make more troms to cover up cover

922
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:32,920
up the foliage and protect it better uh

923
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:37,880
it doesn't necessarily make more potent

924
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:42,318
pyoms it just makes more of them so as

925
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:45,880
far as increase in potency no I didn't

926
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:47,759
see that but the number of tricomes yeah

927
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,440
now here's the this is also real

928
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,480
interesting the the garden down below at

929
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,440
300

930
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:57,760
M

931
00:42:53,440 --> 00:43:00,720
uh it was the same potency uh

932
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:05,440
approximately as the one up

933
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:08,519
above in relation to weight because of

934
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:11,559
uh well no let's see in relation to

935
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:14,199
weight what do I mean if you took one

936
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:19,680
plant and that would that would weigh uh

937
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:23,039
say 100 G and then at 300 M and then you

938
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:26,358
take another plant at 900 M and that

939
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:28,000
would weigh 80 grams well they still had

940
00:43:26,358 --> 00:43:33,279
the same

941
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:36,760
potency the same level of

942
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,480
of stuff in it pretty straightforward

943
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,760
answer there yeah I've heard pretty much

944
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,400
the same stuff over the course of the

945
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:47,000
past several years yeah I mean it's

946
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,920
that's what I found so far too and so we

947
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,920
all

948
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,000
agree that's

949
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,159
good I want to get into something a

950
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,639
little bit more controversial next the

951
00:43:54,159 --> 00:44:00,159
flushing plants or soil prior to harvest

952
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:03,719
should Growers flush their plants or or

953
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:07,639
soil prior to harvest if so what are the

954
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:10,679
benefits okay the the number one is the

955
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:13,598
term cuz what they would actually be

956
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:16,960
doing they're not flushing the plant

957
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:19,400
they're actually leeching the soil

958
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,599
leeching the soil flushing is a

959
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,480
different term uh and usually people use

960
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:29,440
that term flushing and I made this

961
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,960
mistake until I was corrected uh so um

962
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,519
now it doesn't make any difference

963
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,480
whatsoever you can plant you can grow

964
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:39,119
right fertilize right up to the end what

965
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,760
what the the deal is

966
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:45,200
see now this is this is where my

967
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,680
perspective comes in this is a good part

968
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:50,879
about being an old guy cuz see when this

969
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:54,838
industry grew the the real money there

970
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,800
was there was real money in fertilizer

971
00:44:54,838 --> 00:44:58,719
that's where the money was at because

972
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,720
people people needed it over and over

973
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:03,959
and then they could keep buying it over

974
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:07,159
and over well as we all know most of

975
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:10,199
what you find in fertilizer is water so

976
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:12,239
they take a little bit and and to make

977
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:14,199
to make a dollar like well say if we use

978
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:15,358
a dollar for example make a dollars

979
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:19,118
worth of

980
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:21,639
fertilizer uh that you would buy retail

981
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,640
it cost you about uh two to three

982
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:28,440
pennies to make that so you've got a

983
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:30,558
really a big a big uh margin there so

984
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,240
that's why everybody seemed to be an

985
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:34,480
expert in

986
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:36,358
fertilizers and because that's where the

987
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,679
only place to make any money at it and

988
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:39,598
that you couldn't make any money at

989
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:42,639
lights because they were made by big

990
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,400
companies and and you know or or the

991
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:47,400
other stuff you could buy all of that

992
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,800
stuff at the nursery but the fertilizers

993
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:55,280
if you had your special fertilizer well

994
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:57,800
then you could uh uh grow the best

995
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:01,760
plants the biggest plants so everybody

996
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:04,839
was a an expert well now you go into a

997
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:09,240
nursery for example any plant just any

998
00:46:04,838 --> 00:46:11,318
kind of a plant nursery you know and um

999
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:14,279
you look and see you go to the

1000
00:46:11,318 --> 00:46:17,199
fertilizer section and you see there' be

1001
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,960
about like 20 maybe 30 different

1002
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:24,078
fertilizers

1003
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:26,559
for I don't know two 300 maybe 500

1004
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,720
different types of plants you got 20

1005
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,960
kinds of a fertilizers for 500 different

1006
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:33,399
kinds of plants but you got this plant

1007
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,760
the one that we've been dealing with

1008
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:39,680
this this plant here and what do we have

1009
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:43,319
we have we

1010
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:46,318
have one plant and like 500 kind of

1011
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:49,318
fertilizers for it you know something's

1012
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:51,400
backwards something's backwards well

1013
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:53,599
it's called it's money money is the

1014
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,800
thing that's made the big difference so

1015
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,960
what they've done is and then they they

1016
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:00,240
they make that uh the hydroponic

1017
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:03,760
fertilizers they make all kinds of

1018
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:05,679
different mixes with them and stuff well

1019
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,359
that's just to take people's money out

1020
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:11,598
of their pocket because I I never used

1021
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:16,880
all that stuff and it's worked fine for

1022
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:19,480
me um yeah so that's that's what I'd be

1023
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:22,039
thinking out about more than anything

1024
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,199
else I don't have any good statistics

1025
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:27,639
here but you know I used to be I was a

1026
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:30,439
garden Rider in in America you know like

1027
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:33,358
a garden well Garden Riders of America

1028
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:37,679
we had an association a National

1029
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:39,838
Association um yeah and uh one of the

1030
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:42,318
things that they that we learned there

1031
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:45,679
was uh

1032
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:49,000
see people put home gardeners home

1033
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:51,399
gardeners put about 10 times more

1034
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:55,880
fertilizer and chemicals on their

1035
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:59,240
Gardens than they need to you know and

1036
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:01,640
the same goes with indoor Growers too

1037
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:04,519
they they they put a lot more stuff on

1038
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:07,440
there than they need to and it's a real

1039
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:10,119
good living and stuff but you a lot of

1040
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:14,800
that stuff you just don't need you don't

1041
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:18,640
need uh you know uh they got you loaded

1042
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:22,599
up so heavily on on all the

1043
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:24,480
fertilizers um I I wonder I mean you

1044
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:26,920
know it's not a real I'm not going to be

1045
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,920
real popular with the with a few people

1046
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,159
in the

1047
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,240
industry but man I mean all those

1048
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:36,558
fertilizer guys made tons of money I

1049
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:40,000
mean I made serious money and I never I

1050
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:43,319
mean some guys had like seven different

1051
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,960
products you'd put in got a little pot

1052
00:48:43,318 --> 00:48:48,318
here you got seven different products

1053
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:51,559
you put in there that's a lot you I

1054
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:53,679
don't I don't understand that now you

1055
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:55,599
know and then the farmers I mean you

1056
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:57,480
just need a little bit of fritted tra

1057
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,280
Trace elements you know the fritted

1058
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:03,318
trace elements those are the ones that

1059
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:06,119
it means like claw so it it hooks it

1060
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:09,000
hooks onto the the other elements and it

1061
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:12,160
stays with them so um so it's

1062
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,798
immediately available and then uh that

1063
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:17,960
then your primary nutrients and that's

1064
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:19,960
that's about it uh secondary ones and

1065
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:22,798
they mix sulfur with everything every I

1066
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,920
mean it's just like hooked onto sulfur

1067
00:49:22,798 --> 00:49:27,119
molecules hooked onto everything it

1068
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:31,358
seems so you don't need any sulfur

1069
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:33,480
because it's already there um yeah yeah

1070
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:35,759
but if anything I mean I would for

1071
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:38,318
people I would suggest that they get a

1072
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:41,119
soil test you want to do something get a

1073
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:44,119
soil test that's the best thing to do

1074
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:47,960
because then you find out what you need

1075
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:50,920
um you know and also with the organic

1076
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:52,960
stuff people carry that over uh go

1077
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,200
overboard on that I know I certainly did

1078
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,480
in the first few years when I was

1079
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:01,558
organic G gardening

1080
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:04,920
uh gardening organically I had uh I had

1081
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:09,079
I don't know maybe 10% organic matter in

1082
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:13,280
the soil and you know five is a

1083
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:16,160
lot um yeah but it it causes more

1084
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:18,240
trouble than it's worth you know but

1085
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:21,039
yeah I mean you go to a soil scientists

1086
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:25,199
and they will always call it mineral

1087
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:28,000
soil because it's mainly minerals you

1088
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:30,719
know those guys are really well

1089
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,798
educated and I'd listen to

1090
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:35,118
them yeah it could be super helpful to

1091
00:50:32,798 --> 00:50:37,079
get that soil test and even talking to

1092
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,599
an expert like I talked to Bryant Mason

1093
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,960
the soil doctor I'm not sure if you know

1094
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:43,240
who he is or not but he's excellent very

1095
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,480
knowledgeable and he um does Consulting

1096
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:46,919
he's a crop adviser so he can take your

1097
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,318
soil test and then kind of give you

1098
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,920
information on what you need to add into

1099
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:52,119
it I think it's a great way to go about

1100
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,720
it for sure I I do think you can overdo

1101
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:55,480
it as well like you had mentioned like

1102
00:50:53,719 --> 00:50:57,039
you had done I've overdone it as well

1103
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,760
when it comes to the organ organic side

1104
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:00,759
of thing so it is possible I think

1105
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,400
that's a misconception out there is

1106
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,200
people say that oh if you're growing

1107
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,160
with or organic inputs or all natural

1108
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:08,078
inputs the plant's just going to uptake

1109
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:10,358
what it wants when it wants so there's

1110
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,200
no harm in putting too much which is

1111
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:15,239
which we know now is uh is definitely

1112
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:17,078
not true so no not at all I mean they

1113
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:20,439
can you can you

1114
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:22,640
can oh like hot manures for example

1115
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:26,079
there's all kinds of stuff you can burn

1116
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:29,719
with uh you look at that and it's

1117
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:33,000
expensive too you know the the bat guano

1118
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:35,439
that's really expensive and you

1119
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,119
know you know how hard it is to chase

1120
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,400
those little bats around have them poop

1121
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:39,400
in a

1122
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,719
bag it's a tough job man T job those

1123
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:48,358
guys should get paid a lot

1124
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:51,318
yeah that's funny I want to shift over

1125
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:53,558
to drying I wanted to get your input on

1126
00:51:51,318 --> 00:51:56,798
what do you feel is the optimal drying

1127
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:59,119
conditions and drying time oh man see

1128
00:51:56,798 --> 00:52:02,039
there you go uh there's all these

1129
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:04,680
different variables uh first off it

1130
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:07,358
depends on how the pl plants harvested

1131
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:09,838
how big the plant is do you have do you

1132
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:12,798
have the main stem is the main stem

1133
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:15,318
there or is there going to be smaller

1134
00:52:12,798 --> 00:52:18,400
stems um you know

1135
00:52:15,318 --> 00:52:21,639
so say for example if you harvest

1136
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:24,559
Harvest a plant and

1137
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:27,798
um uh you you cut all the flowers off

1138
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,839
the stems and then the leaves off the

1139
00:52:27,798 --> 00:52:31,318
off of the

1140
00:52:28,838 --> 00:52:34,599
flowers uh then you've just got flower

1141
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:37,838
buds there well those can be put in uh

1142
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:39,760
on on one of those uh little like dry

1143
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:43,078
screens or something you know they have

1144
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:46,359
those expandable net net shelves that

1145
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:50,280
that open up and you've got uh usually

1146
00:52:46,358 --> 00:52:52,880
it's two or 3 feet across I think I had

1147
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:56,920
I had one that was 4T across that was

1148
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:59,480
really big it would hold a lot yeah but

1149
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:03,920
um yeah you can you can dry them a lot

1150
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:08,039
faster in there uh than than with a a

1151
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:10,639
big plant a big uh uh plant where you

1152
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:14,159
hold the the entire plant and keep the

1153
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:18,598
stems because see there's there's

1154
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:21,598
different um different levels of of

1155
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:23,318
moisture see you've got a stem this big

1156
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,880
well that's going to hold more moisture

1157
00:53:23,318 --> 00:53:27,960
than a stem this big you know they're

1158
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:31,079
just different sizes so this has more

1159
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:34,960
moisture than this one and then the leaf

1160
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:38,680
that's real narrow or real thin uh will

1161
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:42,920
will dissipate much quicker too so the

1162
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:44,838
idea is to equalize everything out you

1163
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:48,838
want to get you want to get out all of

1164
00:53:44,838 --> 00:53:51,679
those all the the pigments and stuff and

1165
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:54,599
um God there's tons of tons of stuff in

1166
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:57,798
there that makes it taste green or or

1167
00:53:54,599 --> 00:54:00,640
ammonia like um

1168
00:53:57,798 --> 00:54:03,318
but the dry the drawing volatized all of

1169
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:06,358
that or just basically it it it

1170
00:54:03,318 --> 00:54:11,000
dissipates into the air uh so you can

1171
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:15,358
get rid rid of all of that so it depends

1172
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:18,719
on what you want you can either keep the

1173
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:21,239
leaves on or keep or take the leaves off

1174
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:24,439
right at first when it's Supple usually

1175
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:26,879
smaller Growers will do that and then

1176
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,280
big Growers usually

1177
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,960
wait and they'll dry the whole branches

1178
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:35,040
the whole plant first or parts of the

1179
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:37,400
plant and then remove the leaves

1180
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:41,239
afterwards it seems to be more efficient

1181
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:42,720
that way um and then I'll tell you I

1182
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:47,838
just got

1183
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:49,838
these um I just got these things here

1184
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:54,880
they're from uh

1185
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:57,639
seedsman and there's apparently uh TPL

1186
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:03,119
loock it's called TPL loock

1187
00:54:57,639 --> 00:55:06,719
yeah uh but it's uh 58 to 62%

1188
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:11,280
humidity and the ones I've seen have

1189
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:14,279
been well they go from 55 to to 60 65

1190
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:17,720
but it depends this is this is

1191
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:21,640
approximately how much humidity here uh

1192
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:26,959
the way I do or or that you want your

1193
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:30,838
plant have what I do is I did um uh

1194
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:35,358
I I measured it uh what the flower

1195
00:55:30,838 --> 00:55:40,519
weighs when it's wet and then when it's

1196
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:44,400
when it's dissipated 3/4 of its of its

1197
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:48,440
moisture that'll be uh well say if it

1198
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:52,680
weighs uh 10 10 gam when it's dry when

1199
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:55,760
it's wet it would weigh uh 2 G and a

1200
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:57,038
half when it's dry and that would put it

1201
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:02,039
at a

1202
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:05,160
approximately 70% moisture 60% moisture

1203
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:08,000
in that range after that then you're

1204
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:10,679
going to have to to check yourself my

1205
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,920
rule of thumb the one I came up with

1206
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:17,798
years ago is like when you snap the stem

1207
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:22,079
if the stem actually snaps then it's dry

1208
00:56:17,798 --> 00:56:23,719
or if it's uh dry enough but you know uh

1209
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:29,039
if it's dry enough to

1210
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:34,439
burn um but I'll I tell you if you can

1211
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:38,039
measure the uh the uh humidity or well

1212
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:40,079
the moisture within the within the

1213
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:44,119
flow

1214
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:47,039
it's perfect perfect um to do it that

1215
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:51,440
way if you can if you can measure that

1216
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:54,160
you're you're best off um and then you

1217
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,480
come down to the curing and the curing

1218
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:59,759
I'm kind of like rambling on here the

1219
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:01,960
the curing what you do is uh you want to

1220
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,319
even out the moisture cuz you had the

1221
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:07,798
the the real thin leaf and then the

1222
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:09,960
thick stem so they'll hold different

1223
00:57:07,798 --> 00:57:13,440
moisture at different rates well you

1224
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:16,639
want to balance that out and what what

1225
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:19,798
curing will do is it it evens those

1226
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:22,000
things those two moistures out hope that

1227
00:57:19,798 --> 00:57:24,239
was a r answer I kind of found found

1228
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,318
myself rambling a little that's all

1229
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:28,879
right I appreciate your Insight on that

1230
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:30,480
one we have reached the hour mark here

1231
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,200
so we're going to wrap things up can you

1232
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,519
tell the listeners how they can find you

1233
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:36,000
and is there anything upcoming in the

1234
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:37,960
future that you want to talk about yeah

1235
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:42,000
let's see we got a lot of stuff I got a

1236
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:43,559
lot of stuff going on uh you can go to p

g- cantes c r v n tes.com for servantes

1239
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:55,279
and you see this mug right here um yeah

1240
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,798
and you can look up all kinds of history

1241
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,160
about me huh

1242
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:01,639
and there's lots of garden information

1243
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:04,480
tons of garden information and then you

1244
00:58:01,639 --> 00:58:07,558
can go to that site and you can also

1245
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:09,519
pick up this book here for free in 11

1246
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:13,200
different languages and it's just like

1247
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:17,798
600 Pages you know A4 format in Europe

1248
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:21,078
or uh 8 1 12 by 11 in in uh the United

1249
00:58:17,798 --> 00:58:23,798
States and then let's see next month

1250
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:27,039
right at a month from now is going to be

1251
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:28,960
spannabis and spannabis in barcelon

1252
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:31,960
and I've been talking to people and

1253
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,679
making all kinds of plans and stuff uh

1254
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:36,358
but that's that's a real big Fair it

1255
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:39,798
used to be the biggest one in the world

1256
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:44,880
uh but now Las Vegas is bigger the Las

1257
00:58:39,798 --> 00:58:49,239
Vegas fair and also the German Fair

1258
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:53,400
um uh Mary Jane which is in Berlin and

1259
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:57,078
that's in June in middle of June uh but

1260
00:58:53,400 --> 00:59:00,720
that that fair is huge it was is way

1261
00:58:57,079 --> 00:59:04,440
bigger than the fair we have here in

1262
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:07,279
Barcelona and then also I'll be going to

1263
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:09,838
uh haven't haven't decided for sure but

1264
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:14,280
I probably will go up there to uh

1265
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:17,358
Amsterdam to uh Green Tech and that is

1266
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:21,400
really a good fair that is the biggest

1267
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:24,838
um Horticultural fair in the world and

1268
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:28,119
we have our own section there people

1269
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:30,480
like us we have our own section you know

1270
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:32,160
and before they used to kick us out all

1271
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:35,519
the time but
