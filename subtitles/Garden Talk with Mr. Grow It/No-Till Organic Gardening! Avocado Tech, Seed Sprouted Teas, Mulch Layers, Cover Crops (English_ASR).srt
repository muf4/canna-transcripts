1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,639
take an avocado superfood super nutrient

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,480
rich to begin with

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,240
and you mix in some stuff like say

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,000
malted barley flour because the worms

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,719
they really like the malted barley flour

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,798
and then put it

7
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:14,798
top down onto the soil and what's going

8
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:15,759
to happen is the worms in your soil are

9
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:16,480
going to come up and they're going to

10
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,160
just start

11
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,920
feeding on this stuff you want to think

12
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,719
about it like a fish tank where

13
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,400
if you have a very small fish tank any

14
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,278
changes in that system are going to

15
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,439
greatly affect

16
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,320
how things work so the bigger the system

17
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,000
that you have

18
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,320
the easier it is to sustain it and

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,480
maintain it and big changes

20
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,558
may have less of an effect overall

21
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,919
blends tend to use a lot of things like

22
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,558
bone meal blood meal

23
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,840
and you have to think about where did

24
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,839
those come from

25
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
organically

26
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,000
what's up everybody if you that don't

27
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,759
know me my name is chris aka mr growit

and welcome to my talk channel in this

29
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,399
video i interview another youtuber

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,359
he goes by photosyntec he is an organic

31
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,280
gardener

32
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,280
he goes indoors i think he has plants

33
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,478
outdoors as well and i pick his brain

34
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,079
pretty good in this video we talk about

35
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,599
a ton of different things

36
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,000
we talk about pot size we talk about

37
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,000
what's in his mix we talk about cover

38

little bit about yourself and how you

62
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:58,078
got into growing

63
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,798
yeah for sure so i'm up in canada uh

64
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,519
canadian ac mpr grower is what i'm

65
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,680
called up here

66
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,718
licensed legal grower for medical

67
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,920
cannabis

68
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,199
i've been gardening for easily a dozen

69
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,080
years but i've only been growing

70
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,639
cannabis now

71
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,800
since well legalization came back in

72
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,039
october of 2018.

73
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,280
otherwise started outgrowing synthetics

74
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,560
as i think most growers do

75
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,640
and evolved into organics says i see a

76
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,318
lot of growers are starting to do now

77
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,399
uh definitely becoming a more popular

78
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:31,598
way to grow other than that i

79
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,239
run a youtube channel called photosyntec

80
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,598
talk about organics a lot gardening and

81
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,159
you know just generally there to help

82
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,039
people

83
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:41,439
you know learn how to grow and you know

84
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,878
do the best cannabis they can

85
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,959
nice so i'm going to pick your brain

86
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,679
specifically about the organic side of

87
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,120
things

88
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,800
i know you got some good knowledge in

89
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,439
that let's start with

90
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,519
pot size so what size grill pots do you

91
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,759
use when growing organically

92
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,039
well ideally the biggest that you

93
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,639
possibly can

94
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,799
especially if you're going to introduce

95
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,279
worms into the system

96
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,439
right now in my space i'm using some 15

97
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,439
gallon pots and that's about the

98
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,158
smallest that you'd want to go

99
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,239
realistically 30 would be better but i

100
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,840
will be moving into some 80 gallon grass

101
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,759
root fabric pots here

102
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,680
over the next couple weeks and that's

103
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,000
really going to allow me to have a a

104
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,680
much

105
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,519
better system i mean you want to think

106
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,319
about it like a fish tank where

107
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,920
if you have a very small fish tank any

108
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:26,878
changes in that system are going to

109
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,039
greatly affect

110
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:29,919
how things work so the bigger the system

111
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:31,519
that you have

112
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,919
the easier it is to sustain it and

113
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,719
maintain it and big changes

114
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,000
may have less of an effect overall

115
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,560
that's a really good point i've

116
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,158
um i started out with bottle nutrients

117
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,920
as well and then kind of switched to

118
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,239
organics i've been mostly doing the

119
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,199
blends but i did try them out in three

120
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,519
gallon containers

121
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,598
five gallon containers and you know

122
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,120
oftentimes it's kind of a struggle

123
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,359
and i like the way you put that with the

124
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,640
with the fish tank so

125
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,400
what type of grill pot do you use use

126
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,079
plastic do you use plastic at all or

127
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,640
just the the fabric pots that you

128
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,920
mentioned

129
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,279
been playing around with a couple

130
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,878
different things trying to find stuff

131
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,199
that works the best

132
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,719
uh right now and again going back on the

133
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,158
grass root stuff uh

134
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,000
something that i've recently tried is

135
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,438
the transplantators

136
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,279
i don't know if you're aware it's a

137
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,040
fabric pot but it actually has velcro on

138
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,879
the sides so you can split the thing

139
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,080
open to take your plants out

140
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:26,240
but you know it depends i i'll take

141
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,159
clones i'll put them in just little tiny

142
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,360
plastic jars because i'm not or i should

143
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,720
say plastic containers

144
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,319
because i'm not planning on keeping them

145
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,440
in there for a long time if i know what

146
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,719
i'm going to transplant

147
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,639
out i do prefer plastic because

148
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,160
well any fabric pot as i'm sure you've

149
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,478
found they are a pain

150
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,479
to pull the the plant out of and again

151
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,319
why i like these transplantators

152
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:47,839
because they've got the velcro side so

153
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,759
excited to use those

154
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,359
that makes sense i was actually at mj

155
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,639
bizcon um

156
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,439
last year they didn't have it but the

157
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,478
year before 2019 i did talk to the guys

158
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,680
at grassroots

159
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:58,959
and one of the things that they had

160
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,519
pointed out that was pretty interesting

161
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,439
is now

162
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,120
instead of just doing straight up fabric

163
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,120
they're adding in that liner

164
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,319
yeah on the inside uh because one thing

165
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,120
they had mentioned is that

166
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,680
you know when you're running living soil

167
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,840
with

168
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,280
the regular fabric pots it's drying out

169
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,918
from all the sides

170
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,478
and he says that's really not natural so

171
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,478
um

172
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,000
there is still aeration down below it's

173
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,800
still just fabric down below

174
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,800
and i think on the very top there's also

175
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,800
some air in there i got a visitor

176
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,280
but i thought that was pretty

177
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,478
interesting um so i'm actually using

178
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:36,799
the plastic pots now but i wouldn't um

179
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,879
i do actually have a two foot by ten

180
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,560
foot bed for outdoors

181
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,800
okay and it does have the liner it's for

182
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,079
my vegetables right right um which works

183
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,520
pretty good but yeah i thought that was

184
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,319
that was pretty interesting when he had

185
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,319
mentioned that

186
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,000
yeah so just to touch back on that i've

187
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,439
even seen and talked to some of my

188
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,399
viewers who will take and

189
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,399
wrap plastic wrap around a fabric pot to

190
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,918
act just like that liner and tell me

191
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,439
that they get great success with it

192
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,519
oh that's a good hack that's a really

193
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,519
good yeah i haven't tried it myself but

194
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,198
as soon as i get the opportunity if i

195
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,079
need to but because i'm moving all over

196
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,319
the fabric

197
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:13,439
beds anyway we'll see hmm makes sense

198
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,800
so what do you use for uh medium i've

199
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,680
been playing around

200
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,439
um mostly living soil here for at least

201
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,560
over the last six months

202
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,639
uh a mix that i've originally sort of

203
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,038
tried to make myself and

204
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,400
i recently did a video on that calling

205
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,719
that sort of my biggest failing

206
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,399
as an organic grower was thinking that i

207
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,000
was a soil scientist and knew how to go

208
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,478
about making this stuff myself

209
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,079
and for the most part it's not too

210
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:39,680
difficult to mix up with soil there's

211
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,038
lots of recipes out there

212
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,560
and you know as an organic grower and

213
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:48,719
most organic cannabis growers i think

214
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,519
what turned me on was mr canucks grow

215
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,000
his coco coir his dry amendments

216
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,439
making it look easy boy is that a rabbit

217
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,478
hole you can go down

218
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,000
but to that point um i i do mainly a

219
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,318
cocoa base now

220
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,319
and it's based heavily off of the build

221
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,680
a soil mix and when i say heavily about

222
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,199
the only thing that i'm doing different

223
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,079
than their recipe is i'm adding in some

224
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,759
biochar

225
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:14,240
uh for many many beneficial qualities

226
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,598
got it okay and correct me farm on they

227
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,319
have three different mixes on their

228
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,439
website

229
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,039
yours is the thirty thirty three thirty

230
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,079
three thirty three right so one point

231
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,478
one part

232
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,318
and it's um coco co so thirty three

233
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,719
percent coco coir

234
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,598
thirty three percent aeration and then

235
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,240
thirty 33

236
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:34,079
compost is that right yeah you bet now

237
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,918
just to point on that um they've got

238
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,439
another mix on there it's uh i believe

239
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,399
it's uh what is it

240
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,680
five parts compost two parts aeration

241
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,560
one part

242
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,840
uh no sorry five parts cocoa two parts

243
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,360
anyway you'd have to go on it's recipe

244
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,239
number two i can't remember

245
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,800
but the the takeaway there is i'm using

246
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,439
the one that's heavy compost the 33 33

247
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,240
33

248
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,519
because i have excellent quality compost

249
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,478
sea soil stuff i

250
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,560
i get it up here i don't know if you

251
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,918
guys can get it down there but it's

252
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,439
excellent excellent quality so that's

253
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:04,000
the takeaway there is if you can get the

254
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,879
really

255
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,160
good good high quality uh i think booze

256
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,039
blend is what i've heard recommended

257
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,039
down there

258
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:15,120
um then maybe look at that 33 33 33 mix

259
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,240
i've had wicked results with it super

260
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,280
super pleased and that's what i'm going

261
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,598
to be filling my uh

262
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,598
my beds with when i when i get those

263
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,560
kicked off here in the next couple weeks

264
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,159
got it and then so the the last 33 is

265
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,199
going to be aeration

266
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,520
you can use a bunch of different things

267
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,000
variation what do you use for aeration

268
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,519
i've been playing around um i've landed

269
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,719
on a mix of

270
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,479
hydroton clay pebbles and rice hulls

271
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,000
uh the nice thing about the rice hulls

272
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,759
is they break down over time

273
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and help give you a little extra silicon

274
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,639
to your medium and silica as i'm sure

275
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,120
you know

276
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,199
uh will help your plants grow bigger

277
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,759
stronger cellular walls protect against

278
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,440
pests

279
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,039
it's just a very beneficial

280
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,080
micronutrient to have into the

281
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,240
the mix nice yeah

282
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,320
so what else do you amend into the

283
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,680
medium to begin with on top of that

284
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,278
33 33 33 well following of course that

285
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,639
build a soil mix

286
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,559
that's the thing i like about it is

287
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:09,039
their their recipe number one it's a

288
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,639
really

289
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:16,000
simple simple mix you've got your npk

290
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,759
uh parts it's uh neem or karanja

291
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,839
now just to get into that for a minute

292
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,879
neem is uh something that's broken down

293
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,519
from the neem tree

294
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,080
and karanja very similar and if you

295
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,080
can't

296
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,680
get karanjan you can only get neem or

297
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,040
vice versa they can be used pretty much

298
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,519
interchangeably

299
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,439
they look very similar and they have

300
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,519
very similar properties and also very

301
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,080
very good at protecting against pests

302
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,600
the other npk ingredients that go in

303
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,000
there is kelp meal

304
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,519
high in potassium tons of micronutrients

305
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,360
as well and you know just

306
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,519
well kelp of course fastest growing

307
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,000
plant on the planet so why not use

308
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,360
kelp and then the other one that goes in

309
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,720
there is going to be some crab meal

310
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,839
you've got your chitin

311
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,720
you've got um other beneficial parts to

312
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,480
it as well

313
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,639
and then there's going to be the mineral

314
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,920
side of things uh

315
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,679
basil rock dust which i'm actually

316
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,199
playing with a little bit um up here

317
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,120
gaia green has a rock

318
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,959
dust blend that i'm looking at trying to

319
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,679
change in because it's got some glacial

320
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,838
rock dust

321
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,359
some basalt rock dust as well as a few

322
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,200
other sources and i think

323
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,800
one of the things i really try to focus

324
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,278
on doing organic growing

325
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,319
is as many diverse sources as possible

326
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,958
just to

327
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,519
get that mix as as well again diverse

328
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,958
because

329
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,399
having a large variety of inputs

330
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,239
really make sure that the plants gonna

331
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,600
get what it needs and then the last

332
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,399
thing of course that i put in there is

333
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,000
oyster shell

334
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,559
flour which helps with your calcium

335
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,320
and i believe the osf also does a little

336
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:45,359
bit of buffering of ph

337
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,800
as well as the microbes in the soil so i

338
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,440
don't have to worry about doing things

339
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,359
like ph

340
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,399
my water okay i know you also

341
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,440
add worms to your medium which type do

342
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,759
you use

343
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,519
right now i've just got the the red

344
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:00,399
wigglers i would like to get the night

345
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,240
crawlers

346
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,759
and the difference there is the red

347
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,519
wigglers they sit up top they're a

348
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,720
compost worm so they're doing all that

349
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,320
work up in the

350
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,839
the rhizosphere up in the top part of

351
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,519
the soil but the night crawlers they're

352
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,720
going to go down deeper and until that

353
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,799
lower part of the soil so

354
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,320
having a good mixture again of both that

355
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,359
diversity is going to give you the best

356
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,278
results

357
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,839
so in a previous convo you actually

358
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,320
introduced me to avocado tech

359
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,920
can you explain to the listeners what

360
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,040
that is and how you incorporate that

361
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,599
into your garden

362
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,879
so definitely have to give a shout out

363
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,000
to uh

364
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,639
to blue at blue of green tank on

365
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,600
instagram

366
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,399
at blue underscore of underscore green

367
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,079
tank there

368
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,240
uh he came up with this it's based off

369
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,799
the idea of fruit drop theory

370
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,079
uh as a fruit tree grows up or a berry

371
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,759
bush

372
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,078
it's going to grow some fruit and

373
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,799
eventually drop it with the idea or the

374
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,399
hope that

375
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,319
and an animal is going to pick it up or

376
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,278
perhaps it's just going to decompose

377
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,040
there in the ground

378
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,958
so you've got this wonderful piece of

379
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,958
fruit that's full of all these nutrients

380
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,719
and it's decomposing going back in

381
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,159
and feeding that soil and of course

382
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,240
there's an organic or that's what we do

383
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,799
we feed the soil to feed the plant

384
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,680
so the idea with avocado tech is to do

385
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,799
just that

386
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:16,239
take an avocado superfood super nutrient

387
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,078
rich to begin with

388
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,839
and you mix in some stuff like say

389
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:21,759
malted barley flour because the worms

390
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,880
they really like the malted barley flour

391
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,159
or some oyster shellflower uh worms need

392
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:27,679
a little bit of grit

393
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,078
so some sand if you don't have it in

394
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,039
your mix uh some osf is nice in there

395
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:32,159
give them that little bit of grit to

396
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,000
help digest things

397
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,199
but basically you just take this mix it

398
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,799
all up like you would

399
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,560
you know a deviled egg put it back into

400
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,559
that avocado shell and then put it

401
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,638
top down onto the soil and what's going

402
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,599
to happen is the worms in your soil are

403
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,399
going to come up and they're going to

404
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,879
just start

405
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,278
feeding on this stuff and returning

406
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,439
those nutrients into a bioavailable form

407
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,799
so your plant can uptake it and then the

408
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,800
best thing about this

409
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,479
the best thing about this is it's it's

410
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:57,120
so low maintenance because you only have

411
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,800
to do it

412
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,639
three times a grow and this is how blue

413
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,000
sells it is it's just you've got a half

414
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,600
an avocado for veg

415
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,679
a half an avocado at the beginning of

416
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,240
flower or a week or two before flour

417
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,559
starts

418
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,519
and then another half an avocado about

419
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:11,599
halfway through

420
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,200
and the only thing that you're really

421
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,560
changing there is once you get into

422
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,440
flour you're going to add in a little

423
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,119
extra

424
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,760
phosphorus i like to use mineralized

425
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,399
phosphate bat guano if you're unfamiliar

426
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:24,720
but i'm looking around seeing what other

427
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,120
more sustainable sources i can find out

428
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,959
there

429
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,560
and that's sort of the challenge too is

430
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,359
always to see what

431
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,759
better practices i as an organic grower

432
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
can

433
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,439
take from industry and you know bring

434
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,240
into my grow room in a more sustainable

435
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,320
fashion

436
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,600
got it yeah i saw a video on it actually

437
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,680
after you mentioned it

438
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,600
and that was blue talking about it and

439
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,638
it showed him flipping over that

440
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,680
uh avocado shell and it was just loaded

441
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,519
with worms

442
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,519
yeah loaded it was it was pretty cool to

443
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,440
see yeah i know i had a buddy stop by

444
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,240
the grower room today to just uh pick up

445
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,959
a clone

446
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,278
and he'd never seen it myself or himself

447
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,879
and

448
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,799
same thing you pull up the avocado and

449
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,320
there's just swarming worms

450
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,159
it's just it's a testament to how well

451
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,600
it works and the takeaway there too is

452
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:06,719
it doesn't have to necessarily be

453
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,720
avocado uh

454
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,480
i know that blues tries uh cantaloupes

455
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,720
and some other you know smaller

456
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,120
dome fruit so the idea is it's a

457
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,440
humidity dome it's completely dark

458
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,959
perfect environment for worms the only

459
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,880
takeaway is if you are going to try

460
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,359
avocado tech and i strongly recommend

461
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:23,759
this

462
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,039
uh is get some bokashi grades and put a

463
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,600
little bokashi mix

464
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,879
in there because i've seen some avocados

465
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,639
start to go anaerobic

466
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,360
so if you've got some bokashi grains in

467
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,799
there bokashi being an anaerobic

468
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,240
compost microorganism it's going to help

469
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,719
break down that that nutrient internal

470
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,278
and

471
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,079
you know provide just a safer way to get

472
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:45,679
things done

473
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,599
that makes sense yeah okay so i want to

474
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:48,319
flip back to water you briefly talked

475
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,399
about water

476
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,920
um what type of water do you use do you

477
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,278
use reverse osmosis

478
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:58,399
distilled well tap water

479
00:14:55,278 --> 00:15:00,720
i've used a variety actually uh so

480
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,399
up until recently my main source of

481
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,480
water in the grow room has been

482
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,078
just half water good old dechlorinated

483
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,600
tap water except in the summer

484
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:09,278
uh where i've got rain barrels sitting

485
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,639
on the side of my house because

486
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,759
why pay for water when you can get it

487
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,120
for free but recently i did install an

488
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,240
arrow watering system

489
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,839
um or i should say ro filter for

490
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,440
watering i use roof water all the time

491
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,800
for my humidifiers because where i live

492
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,360
i have very heavy water

493
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,000
and if you if you see all of a sudden

494
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,278
say you're

495
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,198
you know starting off growing and pretty

496
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,639
humidifier in your space and you're

497
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,559
seeing like a white foamy powder

498
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,039
everywhere it's not powdery mildew per

499
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,599
se

500
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,599
it's likely uh minerals that have come

501
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,240
out of humidifier deposited onto the

502
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,399
surfaces

503
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,680
so that's why i use ro water it's

504
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,600
demineralized water

505
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,198
in my humidifiers but since getting an

506
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,399
ro water filter installed in my house

507
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,000
i've actually changed

508
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,240
over to that to start watering all my

509
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,639
plants because the big thing for me is

510
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,519
my groom's actually outside in my garage

511
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,198
which is

512
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,799
you know good 15 feet from the house and

513
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,078
i don't have water out there so i

514
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,240
normally fill up five

515
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,919
five gallon buckets bring them out there

516
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,198
let the water dechlorinate

517
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,719
and then i'll use that to water my

518
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,078
plants over the course of a couple weeks

519
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,519
so having the ability to

520
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:12,399
just fill up a five gallon container

521
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,759
with our water works really really well

522
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,078
it makes sense yeah it's funny you

523
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,600
mentioned the um the white powdery

524
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,679
substance coming from the

525
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,440
humidifier and you know the root cause

526
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,879
of that is tap water with the minerals

527
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,279
and so on and so forth

528
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,439
um two other things that that impacts is

529
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,958
the carbon filter it actually clogs

530
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,079
those carbon filtered socks

531
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,679
good point you know i've had so many

532
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,120
people say uh reach out to me like i'm

533
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:34,319
getting no suction coming out what's

534
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,839
going on and then

535
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,440
you know the root cause was because they

536
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,199
were using tap water

537
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,800
in their humidifier it was just clogging

538
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,639
that up like pretty quickly

539
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,919
and then i had another person reach out

540
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,159
to me and mention that he saw

541
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,919
a build up on his fan so it was like it

542
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,399
went internal components

543
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,319
actually got into his fan it's all white

544
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,519
substance within his fan it did damage

545
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,040
on that one so

546
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,799
yeah yeah definitely whenever you're

547
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,198
using a humidifier definitely want to

548
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,758
have

549
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:01,758
filtered water or ideally reverse

550
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,000
osmosis water or distilled water

551
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,679
for sure and you know one other thing to

552
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,599
think about and this is just me

553
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,959
thinking out loud is i'm wondering if

554
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,639
you get build up

555
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,798
on the leaves of the plants and it

556
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,759
affects the stomata and the ability to

557
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,318
intake actual moisture and whatnot so

558
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,160
curious

559
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,240
so yeah if you're using humidifier

560
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,240
definitely horror water

561
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,519
and you said you don't ph adjust your

562
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,318
water i

563
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,439
don't know what the ph is in my water

564
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:29,200
when i grow

565
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,038
i haven't measured it in a long long

566
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,279
time i i shouldn't say that i

567
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:35,599
i do occasionally measure my top water

568
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:36,720
if i'm where when i was doing top water

569
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,959
just to make sure that things were

570
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,360
staying on point but because i

571
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:46,798
you know sit around 7.4 to 7.8

572
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:50,079
i don't worry about ph i let the

573
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,879
the gardening i let the medium do that

574
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,918
for me

575
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,520
because the microbiology will take and

576
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,080
along with the nutrients that i put in

577
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,400
there help

578
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,839
buffer that ph to the range that it

579
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,798
needs to be and you know i've even

580
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,959
recently learned

581
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:04,639
that the plant within an area close to

582
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,519
the roots has the ability to affect the

583
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,679
ph around it

584
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,519
to also help make that a more hospitable

585
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,440
zone for the microbiology

586
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:13,599
but the key takeaway there is know what

587
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,320
it is like don't just think you can't

588
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,839
not ph you have to know what it is um

589
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,439
i've got a whole video that i talk about

590
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,079
this on my channel too

591
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,640
i've i agree i've had at one point my

592
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,798
the

593
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,440
water coming out of my tap was over

594
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:29,519
eight 8.0 ph

595
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,759
uh dechlorinated it and gave my plants

596
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,720
and didn't get a good result

597
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:35,119
you know measuring that runoff uh ph it

598
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,200
was

599
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:38,239
high and i was seeing deficiencies in my

600
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,798
plants so

601
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,240
i personally do ph my ph adjusts my

602
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:43,679
water to make sure it's

603
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,839
within you know if i'm growing in soil

604
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,240
between six and seven ph

605
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,279
um that's just what's worked best for me

606
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,599
and that's the thing

607
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,319
like it's it works well for me i don't

608
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:53,839
have to but

609
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:55,839
i mean let me put it through this way if

610
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:58,159
i start to see deficiency or some sort

611
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,240
of toxicity the first thing i'm gonna do

612
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,519
is check runoff and see if that i've got

613
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,200
something odd going on

614
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:04,798
and that should be the takeaway i don't

615
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,279
ph because i don't have to

616
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,759
but i know that it's an absolute top

617
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:12,960
tool in the arsenal if i need to use it

618
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:15,440
makes sense cool okay

619
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,038
so we know what your pot size is uh we

620
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,240
know what your mix is you've amended

621
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,119
that mix up

622
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,839
um you know you've got your plants going

623
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,839
when do you give your first

624
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:29,359
feeding how do you and how do you

625
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,678
feed well it depends like right now i've

626
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:31,918
been

627
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,840
working on trying to do a perpetual so

628
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,280
get to the point where

629
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,959
i would just ideally be

630
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,720
pulling veg plants out of my tent that i

631
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,160
have here behind me and putting those

632
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,519
into the flower room

633
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,000
um so i'd be more reamending the medium

634
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,960
ideally at the point of planting or very

635
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,119
close to it

636
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,798
but because i've been changing beds out

637
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,599
and and working through this whole new

638
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,079
system

639
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,798
um i i don't have a very consistent

640
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,839
approach

641
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,480
to it at this time however that being

642
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,798
said

643
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,558
the idea is if you're doing something

644
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,720
like avocado attack you're doing one of

645
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:07,119
the avocados throughout veg in a couple

646
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,000
weeks

647
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:11,279
before you're getting into golden flower

648
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,640
you want to go again

649
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,960
so you've got a cat running around there

650
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,960
or something

651
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:20,558
but you know to that point the the thing

652
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,558
that you need to remember is if you're

653
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,399
doing organic growing your your

654
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,079
nutrients aren't immediately available

655
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,919
so you have to plan it out

656
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,399
and i think that's that's the main thing

657
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,159
is if you know you're going into flour

658
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,440
or you're planning on flour in two weeks

659
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,760
time

660
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,200
get your your extra phosphorus your

661
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:38,720
extra potassium boost

662
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,960
in now because that's when it's going to

663
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,960
need it get it ready to be bioavailable

664
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,880
for when the plant starts to take it up

665
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,759
so so that's the thing is organics

666
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,960
really involve

667
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,640
a whole lot of planning uh it sounds

668
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,480
like it's not a lot of work because well

669
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,679
i don't ph and i only have to add water

670
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,599
and that's all i do it's but

671
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,280
it isn't there's there's so much

672
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,519
planning involved to

673
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,279
to be successful in that grow to be able

674
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,240
to sit back and just

675
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,519
water yep i agree let's talk a little

676
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,839
bit about cover crops

677
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,119
um so which cover crops do you use and

678
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,439
when do you plant them

679
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,959
uh so the best time to do cover crops is

680
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,759
when you're first starting off your

681
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,400
living soil

682
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,240
mix a week or two before your plants

683
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,919
going in to give them some time to

684
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,000
get built up and start getting some of

685
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,400
that nitrogen into the soil

686
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,240
um the way that i've been doing things

687
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,360
it's just lately i

688
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,880
because i if if uh well let me let me

689
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:32,719
back this up a bit if people haven't

690
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,159
seen my channel i recently ran into an

691
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,240
issue where my growth seeded

692
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,919
so i've been trying to recover by

693
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,640
bringing in and doing a whole bunch of

694
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,840
uh well fast methods to get things

695
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,159
turned around

696
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,599
so right now i'm just doing cover crop

697
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,520
and then i get the plant in there

698
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,839
kind of at the same time but the idea is

699
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,639
yeah cover crop a couple weeks ahead

700
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:53,359
now cover crop that i use you can go as

701
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,038
simple as say

702
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,798
red clove or white clove or something

703
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,200
along those lines but

704
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:01,519
going back to the diversity thing i use

705
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,279
a five seed mix i get from black swallow

706
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,798
living soils up here in canada

707
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:08,720
uh it's got fenugreek uh clover

708
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,400
uh a couple of i can't remember off the

709
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,880
top of my head but it's again it's it's

710
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,640
got

711
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,280
multiple things in it to provide a

712
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,120
higher level of diversity

713
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:18,399
nice yeah i'm just using the white dutch

714
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,119
clover right now but

715
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,080
um yeah i've seen the uh the blends that

716
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:23,599
they have with

717
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:25,359
a couple different ones think about

718
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:26,879
trying those out in the future yeah

719
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,558
i'm actually thinking of maybe throwing

720
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,159
some peas in the grove once i get these

721
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:31,279
uh grassroots fabric pots going just

722
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,840
because they got the trellis going up

723
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:33,839
the side

724
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:34,879
and yeah these are extra excellent

725
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,439
nitrogen fixers

726
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,360
and delicious and mulch layer i know you

727
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,120
add one of those to the top

728
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,719
of the soil what do you use for a mulch

729
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,439
layer and when do you apply that

730
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,798
generally just straw and right away as

731
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,840
soon as you get that that plant

732
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,839
transplanted

733
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:51,359
you want to get the mulch layer down and

734
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,759
if you're doing cover crop don't worry

735
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:53,439
about

736
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,359
putting the mulch over top to cover crop

737
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,640
the cover crop will grow up and through

738
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:01,918
uh i've been working on as well a

739
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,919
a mix of different uh mulches where i've

740
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,320
got some cedar wood chips and people are

741
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,320
gonna go you can't do cedar yeah you can

742
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,759
hit me up on my my channel we'll talk to

743
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:13,119
you about it uh

744
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:15,359
as well as some was it uh pine and uh

745
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,239
again just straw the idea there is

746
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:17,839
getting some

747
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,319
wood in there because what is going to

748
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,839
bring in that fungal component and

749
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:23,038
again with diversity not only do you

750
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:24,720
want good bacterial components in your

751
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:25,679
soil you want lots of fungal components

752
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,960
because funguses

753
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,000
will help break down and and move things

754
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,360
around a lot better

755
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,359
and then of course when we talk about

756
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:34,879
things like mycorrhizae the

757
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:37,038
most beneficial fungus you can have in

758
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,480
the garden well

759
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,759
it's good to have a lot of different

760
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,120
sources yeah that makes sense

761
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:44,558
so you told us when that first feeding

762
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,918
happens all those you know it's kind of

763
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:50,480
a gray area it depends a lot of things

764
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,520
you know what about the second feeding

765
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,000
like something within

766
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,079
flowering uh typically people will do

767
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,839
they'll mend the medium to begin with

768
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,599
then before flipping a flower they'll do

769
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:02,879
some sort of top dressing

770
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:05,119
um you know with some flour type

771
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,760
nutrients and then like 30 days into

772
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,839
flowering

773
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:09,359
along those lines week three four or

774
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:12,000
five of flowering something like that

775
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,798
they will do a another type of top

776
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
feeding

777
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,639
do you do anything like that absolutely

778
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,880
yeah week

779
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,080
week three is when i prefer to hit them

780
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,278
um because

781
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,639
i'll go and do my my initial flower feed

782
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:26,720
a couple weeks ahead

783
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,080
and then once i get into week three i

784
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,000
like to do that feed because again i

785
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:32,000
gotta give that a couple weeks for it to

786
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,119
become bioavailable and ready for the

787
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,480
plants and

788
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,158
you know that that was a bit of a

789
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,079
learning thing too because

790
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,840
going from synthetics to organics it was

791
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,678
just okay well i'm gonna change up my

792
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:42,639
feed week five i'm gonna use this set of

793
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,880
bottles and

794
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,000
you know you have to be prepared for

795
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,080
that but then

796
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,919
also bringing in things like sugars to

797
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,158
help increase microbes and

798
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,520
well boost the ripeness i mean there's

799
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,520
lots of different organic

800
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,400
brightness boosters out there too that

801
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:58,400
you can use so

802
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,720
so what exactly like for that second

803
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,960
feeding is there anything in particular

804
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,079
that you um give to the plant at that

805
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,000
time

806
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,079
yeah we touched on that before it's uh

807
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,119
like i'll do the pk boost the same stuff

808
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:12,399
phosphorus and stuff

809
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,399
and then like kelp for getting your

810
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,880
potassium and whatnot so

811
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,159
okay and then um so you do incorporate

812
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,880
sugars into your garden

813
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,200
absolutely so i i actually sugars once a

814
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,400
week

815
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:27,120
um and i'll mix it up too i like to use

816
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,240
molasses blackstrap molasses and then

817
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,239
i've got some

818
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,679
coconut nectar sugar which i picked up

819
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,519
by accident from the costco

820
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,720
thinking it was a different type of

821
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:35,839
coconut product but

822
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,120
actually i find that i really like this

823
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:38,798
stuff it's a light sugar that dissolves

824
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,319
really well in water and i'll alternate

825
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:43,918
each week i'll do

826
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,960
one tablespoon of sugar or molasses into

827
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,360
the water

828
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,400
uh per gallon mix that up and feed that

829
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,678
and that helps boost up that

830
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,159
microbiology because

831
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,080
one of the things that i don't do is

832
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,799
compost teas

833
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,798
now the reason for that um if you're

834
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,639
familiar with the future cannabis

835
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,400
project earlier this summer they had a

836
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,720
really great episode on talking about

837
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,278
bro

838
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,880
science and uh linda chalker scott i

839
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,919
hope i got her name right

840
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,120
uh fantastic scientist she doesn't work

841
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,038
with cannabis she just

842
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:14,798
works with gardening but she came on she

843
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:18,319
talked a great deal about

844
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:20,480
compost tea and why it's not really

845
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,399
necessary to use compost tea because you

846
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,480
can get the same level of

847
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,080
benefit from it by just top dressing

848
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,599
with compost and that's something that

849
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:28,000
i've been doing a lot of lately is i'll

850
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:29,439
just

851
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,200
top dress with the compost some

852
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,679
earthworm casting some bokashi in the

853
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,080
mix

854
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,200
and then just water in with my molasses

855
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:36,960
water which is

856
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,558
effectively the same thing as doing a

857
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,079
compost tea

858
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:41,678
with the exception of i'm not letting it

859
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,319
brew overnight and letting that

860
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,960
that microbiology bloom in a big pot of

861
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:46,960
water

862
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,400
but i'm letting it bloom in a big pot of

863
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,840
soil so

864
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,600
the idea is all of that compost tea

865
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:54,158
action is happening but it's already in

866
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,278
the pot

867
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,039
in a more concentrated form and i'll say

868
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:00,079
that i've been getting amazing results

869
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:01,519
with this method

870
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:03,599
got it so you don't really do compost

871
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,759
teas do you need like nutrient teas

872
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:07,519
plant teas manure teas anything like

873
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,278
that absolutely you know i've never

874
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,278
heard of manure tea

875
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:12,798
yeah that's i could see how that might

876
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:16,079
be beneficial um

877
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:18,000
no i do seed sprouties uh once a week uh

878
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,240
depending on where i'm in the cycle

879
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,919
vegetative i'll do

880
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,960
pardon me corn barley and alfalfa

881
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,720
and then in flour i'll do corn barley

882
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,798
and mung beans

883
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,640
each one has its own benefits i've got a

884
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:35,839
whole video up on my channel that talks

885
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,000
in depth about it but the short of it is

886
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,359
it's part of the routine corn takes

887
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,278
several days to sprout

888
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,278
barley doesn't take quite as long and

889
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,919
alfalfa and mung beans take even less

890
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:47,440
so on friday night for example i'll take

891
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,960
some corn seeds

892
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,558
i'll put them in some water and let

893
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,558
those soak for a day the next day

894
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:54,879
dump those out add some barley into

895
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,319
another jar let those soak and over the

896
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,760
next you know four or five days

897
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,839
i'm getting these seeds to the point

898
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,319
where they've sprouted and then

899
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,759
i take and cannibalize them by hitting

900
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,519
them with the blender

901
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:06,798
add those into some water to dilute it

902
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,158
and then water from there

903
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:11,278
and um biggest takeaway there is you

904
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,600
want to talk about

905
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,480
overnight growth uh especially with

906
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:16,719
alfalfa

907
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,960
alfalfa has a chemical in it called

908
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,440
tricontinol which is a growth booster

909
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,079
so if if you want to see immediate

910
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,000
growth

911
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,918
um you know like steroid like growth

912
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,159
with your plants just try an alfalfa

913
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,080
sprouted tea just once

914
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,840
the way to mix them is quite simple

915
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:32,558
you're generally going a half a cup of

916
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,000
seeds

917
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:38,000
per five gallons

918
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,679
and then if you're using alfalfa do a

919
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,880
quarter cup because it's it's it'll come

920
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,559
in really hot

921
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,159
and then yeah just just blend that up

922
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,398
and then mix the juice in there i'll

923
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,600
strain it through like a nylon bag too

924
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:49,678
just so i'm not putting all the seed

925
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,519
stuff into the water itself

926
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,120
but then those seeds that i've ground up

927
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:54,398
and put into the nylon bag i'll take an

928
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,239
old top dress into my

929
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,000
pots as well as a little extra treat for

930
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,359
the worms yeah so you talked a little

931
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
bit about uh gaia green i use those

932
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,278
organic blends so um i'm sure there's

933
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,720
people that are watching here that are

934
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:07,519
brand new to my channel maybe this is

935
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,640
the first video

936
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:12,558
you've ever seen of me so a little bit

937
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,720
background on me is i've been growing

938
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:16,158
for almost 11 years now

939
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,679
and most of the time i've been using

940
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,360
those bottled nutrients right synthetics

941
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,519
but i've slowly worked my way it's only

942
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:25,038
weaned my way off the bottles

943
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:27,200
and i started with uh organic blends

944
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,038
so i started with earth dust by the

945
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,278
green sunshine company

946
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:32,240
and uh instructions are pretty pretty

947
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:34,798
straightforward

948
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,399
they have a formula for base and they

949
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:39,759
have a formula for boost

950
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:41,519
the base is what you use when you first

951
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:44,720
amend into and during veg

952
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:46,240
and then use boost for flowering um so

953
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,440
that's what i would typically do i

954
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,278
forget what it was i think it's like two

955
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,440
to four tablespoons per gallon

956
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:52,720
or something like that for the base and

957
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,558
then the boost

958
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,399
had some pretty good results doing that

959
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:57,359
there's so many different organic blends

960
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,239
out there

961
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,119
we've got dr earth down to earth mr bees

962
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,558
trees

963
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:06,158
um there is a new one that i try to with

964
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,200
slow dirt

965
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:12,240
build the soil has their own craft blend

966
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,240
um that they call it uh you've used guya

967
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,720
green have you used any others

968
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,399
besides gaia green guy green and then

969
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,038
just the stuff from black swallow

970
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:23,119
we're i don't know if it's limited up

971
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:25,519
here but

972
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,038
i've got two good sources and and that's

973
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,278
who i rely on and whatnot

974
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:30,798
um i've heard down to earth stuff down

975
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:31,679
in the states is also really good to

976
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:35,440
work with

977
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,278
uh so it's it's really just looking at

978
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,038
where the amendment's coming from how

979
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:40,880
are they sourcing it like

980
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:43,359
one other thing about blends and this is

981
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,919
why i've decided to mix it myself is

982
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:48,319
pardon me blends tend to use a lot of

983
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,880
things like bone meal blood meal and

984
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:51,759
you have to think about where did those

985
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,278
come from

986
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:55,839
organically you know it's it's waste by

987
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:59,359
product

988
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:01,199
from the the food industry and

989
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,119
now it's good that there's a use for

990
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,640
that but does that necessarily mean you

991
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,678
want to be using that to grow

992
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,519
your your plants with and if it works

993
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,080
for you it works for you um you know

994
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,798
like

995
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:13,439
just side note to talk about blood meal

996
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:15,599
for a minute

997
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,640
um if you've got a nitrogen deficiency

998
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:18,959
in your plants

999
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,480
make up a quick tea using just a little

1000
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,120
bit of blood meal and water that into

1001
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,798
your plants

1002
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,000
it's just like a synthetic nutrient at

1003
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,879
that point because you're making it

1004
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,038
bioavailable

1005
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,440
because it is a dried blood that's

1006
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:31,839
basically turned into a ground nutrient

1007
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,759
so those those nutrients may have their

1008
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:36,558
place but uh yeah no um

1009
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:37,519
it's just it's about finding stuff and

1010
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:39,599
local too like

1011
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,558
the local stuff that you can get is way

1012
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,398
better um

1013
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:44,798
you know don't buy and ship nutrients

1014
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,719
across the country if you don't have to

1015
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:48,158
rice hulls for example i need to go and

1016
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,519
get more rice holes for my growth so i'm

1017
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,880
going to go to the local brewery

1018
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,640
and get them there i can get 50 pounds

1019
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,480
for 50 bucks you know

1020
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,799
that's the thing about organic nutrients

1021
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,960
they should be relatively inexpensive

1022
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:00,480
uh a 50-pound bag of oyster shell flour

1023
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,000
flowers gonna cost me i think seventy

1024
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,159
five dollars

1025
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,200
and that's going to feed my two 80

1026
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,399
gallon beds

1027
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:11,679
for the foreseeable future

1028
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:14,158
so organics you know should be fairly

1029
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,399
inexpensive to do in that regard so what

1030
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,399
other advice do you have for growers who

1031
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:20,798
are maybe switching from you know

1032
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:23,038
synthetics over to the organic side of

1033
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:25,839
things

1034
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,200
learn about inoculation that's that's a

1035
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:30,879
really important thing

1036
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,480
because i've said this a couple times

1037
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,240
throughout our chat here is those

1038
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,200
nutrients take some time to become

1039
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,399
available

1040
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,720
and that process is made

1041
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:41,759
faster is increased by inoculating your

1042
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,798
medium

1043
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:47,359
you can inoculate your medium through a

1044
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:49,278
bacteria that comes in a powder form uh

1045
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:50,719
or by doing a compost again i just

1046
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:52,480
talked about compost teas

1047
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,159
and it can be just that simple and the

1048
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,599
way that i kick start my medium i just

1049
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,240
did transplanting last night

1050
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:00,240
was just to again compost on top a

1051
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,880
little bokashi in the mix little earth

1052
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,839
worm castings and just water in you know

1053
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,799
and and that's

1054
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:07,918
that's going to be the best way to do it

1055
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:10,240
but

1056
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,440
if you understand how inoculation works

1057
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,079
in that you need to get

1058
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,080
something living in that medium to start

1059
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,960
eating these nutrients and providing

1060
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,278
them in a

1061
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,480
a more ionic form to your plants then

1062
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:21,519
you're going to be sort of off to the

1063
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,240
races

1064
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,200
and then it's just planning planning

1065
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,120
planning planning

1066
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,278
thinking about what you want to do but

1067
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:30,158
don't try and be a soil scientist find a

1068
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:32,079
recipe

1069
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,440
stick to that recipe and and then start

1070
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,558
experimenting because then i think

1071
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,640
you're going to find a much

1072
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:37,918
better level of success that's really

1073
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,519
good advice that's one thing we didn't

1074
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,960
talk about is microbial inoculants do

1075
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,440
you use any products

1076
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,558
microbial inoculants or recharge mammoth

1077
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,278
p anything like that

1078
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:48,960
not so much um i've been thinking about

1079
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:49,359
getting into the recharge just because i

1080
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,278
hear

1081
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:52,798
so many good things about it and i'm a

1082
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,200
huge fan of the dude girls

1083
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,240
podcast i like watching these guys but

1084
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,440
uh no i

1085
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,440
i rely mostly on just the compost and

1086
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,679
this compost that i get the sea soil

1087
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,360
seems to really do the trick but then to

1088
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,880
that point if i could get another source

1089
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:07,439
of compost it wouldn't be a bad idea

1090
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,079
either

1091
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,679
and using some vermicompost i've started

1092
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,599
up a warm bin a couple months ago so

1093
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,838
i've got fresh worm castings

1094
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,879
and just adding in as many different

1095
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:19,519
sources as

1096
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:21,039
you can well matt thank you so much for

1097

and uh you know letting people know how

1099
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:25,759
you do your grow i think there's a lot

1100
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,000
of good information

1101

beginners

1103
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:32,800
kind of shifting over from the bottled

1104
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:34,159
side of things to the organic side of

1105
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,720
things and you provide a lot of really

1106
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,960
good

1107
