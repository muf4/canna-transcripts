00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,199
episode number 158 in this episode I

11

for 20 years and grows a variety of

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,118
plants he's big into stress testing

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,679
plants which is what we get into in

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,159
today's episode everything from the

16
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,439
types of precision stress benefits how

17
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,359
he goes about the different stress

18
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,280
techniques and more if you want to see

26
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,879
bring free information about gardening

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,520

coming on to the podcast we actually met

70
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,439
in person at MJ biscon 2024 man what an

71
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,839
event it was really really cool to meet

72
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,800
you and uh yeah it was a good vibe dude

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,400
thanks man it was super crazy to see all

74
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,519
you guys huge honor huge honor so we

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,158
talked about having you come on the

76
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,239
podcast and I asked you you know what do

77
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:53,560
you want to talk about and things that

78
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,400
you kind of specialize in you said a

79
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,759
bunch of different things but you really

80
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,640
like to focus on hunting and also

81
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,158
Precision stress that really perked up

82
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,598
my a little bit because Precision stress

83
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,400
I don't think it's talked about enough

84
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,959
things that you can do to stress out the

85
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,519
plant that actually results in better

86
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,280
things happening to the plant whether it

87
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,480
be stressing to cause more tricomes

88
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,598
making it more hardier plant more

89
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,238
vigorous more resistance right to pest

90
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,959
pathogens things like that so we're

91
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,200
going to get into all of that in this

92
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,640
episode kind of what you do to stress

93
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,039
out your plants and kind of what you're

94
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,479
looking for in the plants but first can

95
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,798
we do an introduction tell us a little

96
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,679
bit about yourself and how you got to

97
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:37,080
into gardening I'm Amai cannabis I've

98
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,879
been gardening for almost 20 years now

99
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,879
uh been a huge passion started off as a

100
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:44,199
hobby and then saw the science behind

101
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,679
everything and it really just became

102
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:48,119
like a big drive and like a dream

103
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,319
honestly never thought i' would as far

104
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,400
as I have been um it's kind of

105
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:56,759
crazy um but let's talk about some

106
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,519
plants man let's talk about this how I

107
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:01,840
grow yeah absolutely yeah man tell us

108
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,920
what is your grow style overall grow

109
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,000
style are you indoor outdoor are you

110
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:11,598
soil Coco Hydro what's your style so I

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,438
really started Outdoors um did not do

112
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,159
good too good with that there's a lot of

113
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,639
mold a lot of issues just did not did

114
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,680
not like fighting Mother Nature so kind

115
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,478
of moved indoors really really use a lot

116
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,439
of Coco use

117
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:29,000
promix um what was the other

118
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:31,560
brand honestly no it's mainly promix

119
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,279
yeah promix for the the win uh use the

120
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,319
straight cocoa and then I'll add in my

121
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:42,079
own um peite and a couple other things

122
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:44,680
to to make it nice and Airy um that is

123
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,120
like when I preferably grow but like

124
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,680
when it comes to like the science side

125
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,079
of things I grow in all kinds of

126
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,519
different medium because especially like

127
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:55,800
when I'm chasing certain stress factors

128
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,799
you know it's easier to hone in on like

129
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,840
maybe like a pure cocoa like when I'm

130
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,879
doing droughts I use a lot of pure Coco

131
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,478
go do you use mostly organic inputs or

132
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:10,079
are you doing synthetic or are you Sanic

133
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:12,839
so I jump around a lot with that one too

134
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,599
sorry I'm all over the place I got mad a

135
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:17,599
DHD got to keep moving you know got to

136
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,240
do a lot of things so my main go-to is

137
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,520
really like a Sanic approach I really

138
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,560
have been dabbling in more Organics as

139
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:29,318
of recently um I kind of shied away from

140
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,240
it in the beginning because I I wasn't

141
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:33,639
really too keen on the whole like time

142
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,319
release you got to like get this this

143
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:39,280
mix in right so everything breaks down

144
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,840
at a certain time and I wasn't too fond

145
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,198
of that and it really

146
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,679
like can't you can't play with it you

147
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:47,400
know what I mean and so like if you're

148
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,079
trying to like do a lot of salts and

149
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,638
like Chase like something that is really

150
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:54,000
like resisted against your salts you

151
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,879
can't do that in Organics you know so

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,759
yeah um I hope yeah I hope that answers

153
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,120
your question yeah kind of getting the

154
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,400
Best of Both Worlds there they're using

155
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,759
both organic and synthetic inputs mhm

156
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:09,439
nice so getting into stress what are the

157
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,879
benefits to doing these Precision stress

158
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:14,439
techniques the overall idea is you want

159
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,439
to find the most resilient plant the

160
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:19,000
most resilient plant to all of these

161
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,279
types of traits oh well not traits um

162
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,959
sorry all of these types of

163
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:29,638
stresses so you can find um more

164
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,399
leniency in the garden right so you you

165
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,639
don't have to be as worried about your

166
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:39,879
plant like getting some type of

167
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:42,918
uh we'll just use a a like tobacco

168
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:45,319
Mosaic or something you know more

169
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:46,758
resilience to something like that you

170
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,080
don't have to worry about it spreading

171
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,560
this much but it doesn't mean that you

172
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,279
shouldn't still practice like

173
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,319
cleanliness in the garden you know

174
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,239
always pract practice that never use the

175
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,520
same scissors on on two different plants

176
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,400
you know um just because it is resilient

177
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:05,918
doesn't mean you should just give up but

178
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,839
the whole idea is for it to go into

179
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,439
bigger commercial facilities and then

180
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:13,478
find more

181
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:16,399
um more benefits and more more less

182
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:19,000
problems right cuzz like if you do if

183
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:21,038
you do um your wind training your wind

184
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,639
training will get a bigger structure

185
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,318
right you you can get more yield from it

186
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,720
depending on if you can find that more

187
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,000
resilient plant that can handle that you

188
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,400
can get more structure better like

189
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,240
stronger branches

190
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:39,000
you're the watering the watering is a

191
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,680
good one you're watering um the root

192
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,879
system is really what's happening for

193
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,360
the droughts your root system is

194
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,840
creating a bunch of we'll say Pockets

195
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,919
inside of the roots right that are

196
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:52,000
really holding that water so when there

197
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:56,359
is no water they can red drink that up

198
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,759
it's a a biochemical pathway Pathways or

199
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,439
something like that I can never remember

200
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,840
the actual term

201
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:06,120
sorry uh but there's a bunch of benefits

202
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,959
to these it's not just cuz I like

203
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,280
cousing my plant's a bunch of stress you

204
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:13,560
know um the idea is when you breed with

205
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,839
them right after you after you're

206
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,598
induced these stresses and you keep

207
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,638
breeding through the line right and you

208
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,519
keep going on and you find these traits

209
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:25,439
and you hunt out the the more most

210
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:27,719
resilient ones you can turn around breed

211
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,158
that into like say a plant that you R

212
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,680
like and you can try to pull that from

213
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:34,639
that plant into a plant that you want

214
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,598
right there's little a little bit more

215
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,799
breeding into it than is what I'm saying

216
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,839
but that's the whole idea in like a

217
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,399
general term got it and I know some

218
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,320
folks will do Precision stress

219
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,159
techniques in order to get more

220
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,879
secondary metabolites to be formed you

221
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,799
know a lot of these stress factors

222
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:53,480
actually lead to more triome production

223
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,919
and uh you know we're growing these

224
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,600
medicinal plants that's what a lot of

225
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:59,679
people are really aiming for is the

226
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,120
triome production right so fig got in

227
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,239
that one yeah yeah there are a couple

228
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,200
different stress factors biotic and

229
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,600
abiotic can you break down the

230
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,120
differences so biotic will mainly be

231
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,720
your outside sources really like your

232
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:19,000
natural natural stuff like your plant

233
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:22,160
will have like fungi it'll have viruses

234
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
it'll have um bugs you know all that

235
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,639
kind of issues that that's more of your

236
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,958
biotic your abiotic will be your heat

237
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,838
from your light your your droughts your

238
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:34,359
salt

239
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:37,120
um there's a couple other ones sorry

240
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,720
pruning transplanting goes in there wind

241
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,759
stress is all in there mechanical

242
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,600
stresses was called yeah I think you

243
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:45,360
said salinity as well the salt stress

244
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,000
flooding drought light yeah all that

245
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,759
good stuff mhm let's go into detail on

246
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,078
both of them maybe we'll start off with

247
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,879
abiotic which is uh I think more

248
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:57,958
commonly used as stress temperature

249
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:00,278
maybe start there do you stress the

250
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:02,719
plants at all using temp temperature if

251
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:05,278
so how do you stress it and what do you

252
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,639
look for in the plant heat is one that I

253
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:10,000
I definitely do use because a lot of

254
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:11,759
people um will have that issue you'll

255
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,879
see a lot of tip Burns and a lot of

256
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,600
growths like really doesn't matter where

257
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,480
you go you can see at home grows you can

258
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,879
see them at commercial grow you're going

259
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,360
to see tip Burns all the time so I've

260
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:25,838
been chasing heat as one of them yeah uh

261
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,120
crank up the light mainly I just crank

262
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,600
up the light to everything she gots I'll

263
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,679
add the wind try to keep keep the the

264
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,320
try to keep it in there relatively nice

265
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,359
but to where it's still nice and hot

266
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,200
right and is what I do is I'll start

267
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,680
breeding I'll I I'll throw a plant I

268
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,200
throw a couple plants in there right let

269
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,000
them do their thing breed them out let a

270
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,320
first cycle come through I already know

271
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,919
all the first Cy going to be eh breed

272
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,360
them again same once right and I'm not

273
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:54,360
reversing any of these I'm trying to

274
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,879
keep them as open as possible try to

275
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,720
keep that

276
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:02,200
genetic pull right we'll say is open as

277
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,680
possible so I will get a bunch of uh uh

278
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:09,800
diversity right cuz if say I start with

279
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:12,519
something that has already been um we'll

280
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:15,359
say locked in okay like we'll say use a

281
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:17,919
medical plant as examples so like you'll

282
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,159
find f6s and stuff like that if you use

283
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,879
something like that you're not going to

284
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:22,639
find a lot of that diversity because

285
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,439
they've already locked it into certain

286
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,519
types of traits that they you know

287
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,040
they've wanted but I want other traits

288
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,200
right so we start from the top get them

289
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:34,039
going keep them cycling and as you're

290
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,720
cycling you'll start finding certain

291
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:39,958
plants will produce traits that are more

292
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,720
resilient to these like factors so like

293
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,599
the heat an example it won't you won't

294
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,278
see a bunch of tip burn it'll start

295
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,159
being it'll Thrive it'll be nice flushed

296
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,759
green other plants alongside of it

297
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:52,838
you'll see that they're burning so you

298
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,679
know that you're still doing the right

299
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,839
type of factors right you're still

300
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:58,559
inducing that stress to the point where

301
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:00,000
other plants are naturally like H I

302
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,559
can't do this

303
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,440
you're trying to find that guy you know

304
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:08,759
yeah so that's more or less for the heat

305
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:11,000
one um I do wind as well because I I

306
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:13,639
liked seeing it um there's a lot of a

307
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,320
lot of benefits from the wind one cuz if

308
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:18,560
you if you add a bunch of air like for

309
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,399
example the way I do it is I grab a box

310
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,278
fan and it sounds crazy but I'll just

311
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,360
take a box fan crank it on as high as I

312
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,519
possibly can and I literally will sit it

313
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,399
right in front of the plants just

314
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,919
blasting it blasting it to the point

315
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,480
where the plants are just all sorts of

316
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:36,519
Droopy right and I keep doing that um to

317
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,039
help build up uh what is it why do I

318
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,399
forget the name of

319
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:44,799
it the cell the cell your wall right cuz

320
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:47,120
it essentially it's like breaking your

321
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:52,078
arm right if you break a bone right or

322
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,720
fra fracture it to be precise sorry um

323
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,319
if you fracture a

324
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,480
bone it'll heal over time and it'll

325
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,600
it'll heal stronger right A lot of these

326
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,519
branches and stuff with most common

327
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,159
plants that we we all love right they're

328
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,039
the same way if you add in fractures

329
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:09,958
micr fractures along these branches they

330
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:12,559
will come back heal stronger and it

331
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:14,319
helps promote more flow through those

332
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,039
you know those branches so you get more

333
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,480
energy going to the the output of your

334
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:22,519
you know flow I do a lot of biotic

335
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:26,920
stressing uh I actually introduce a lot

336
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:29,480
of uh PM into the grow cuz I'm trying to

337
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:33,399
find PM resilience so I can breath that

338
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,480
into other plants um that PM resilience

339
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:37,240
is the same way as that you would you

340
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,839
would do for your light you if you want

341
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,399
to start like trying to find something

342
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,000
that's resilient to that kind of trait

343
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,559
you do the same thing that you know pre

344
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,759
lights that one has a lot of ups and

345
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:50,119
downs because you know once you start

346
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,600
bringing in like molds and like bugs and

347
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,240
all kinds of other stuff it's really

348
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,240
hard to like start keeping track of it

349
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,039
making sure it's contained in one area

350
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,480
you start having to do a lot of other

351
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:02,319
like uh uh I PMs and stuff like that

352
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,000
really trying to mitigate any type of

353
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,839
spread so you don't have this test

354
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,519
happening over here and then you spread

355
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:12,120
that mold into like something over here

356
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,720
that you didn't want the mold you know

357
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,198
so yeah so for the PM that's pretty

358
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,160
interesting that you actually introduce

359
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:22,919
it in to stress the plan out and just

360
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,120
see if it's resistant or not how do you

361
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:26,198
can you break that down in details like

362
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,278
what do you actually do to that do you

363
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:30,758
just increase the humidity and kind of

364
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:32,519
cause pm to occur in one area and then

365
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,759
bring that plant into another area to

366
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:38,959
see if it infects another plant or like

367
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:42,199
what's the detail on that one so I work

368
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:45,319
at a commercial facility as well um and

369
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:47,599
I I talk to a lot of other commercial

370
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,278
facilities just trying to help out give

371
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,879
them you know some insight that I

372
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:55,679
have um a lot of people that I know in

373
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:59,240
the commercial facilities are dealing

374
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:02,399
with certain like uh PM big issue big

375
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,480
issue in commercial sites and then uh

376
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,600
fungus Nets fungus Nets and those both

377
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,079
of those so if I still some of the oil

378
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,199
for the fungus knats because that's

379
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:16,078
another one that I do sorry we'll get to

380
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:19,278
that later um uh steal some of the soil

381
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:20,799
from them they just the top 2 in because

382
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,399
that's where the the fungus NS like

383
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,319
laying all their eggs that's where all

384
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,639
all like a good amount of that activity

385
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,399
happens for them top 2 in of that and

386
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:32,519
then still a branch that is infected

387
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:34,720
with PM something that is like heavy

388
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,399
infected take that bring them both back

389
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,399
in take your take your bugs put put them

390
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,318
in your bug site take that branch and

391
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,399
literally just put it into the room add

392
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:46,799
it into the room add a lot of wind in

393
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,600
there and let let it do a natural thing

394
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:52,359
that that PM will naturally spread right

395
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,879
um because I'm trying to stay as natural

396
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,120
as possible I don't want to literally

397
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,639
just go in there and rub the PM plant on

398
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,440
them because that that's not natural you

399
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:05,198
know I want it to spread naturally so it

400
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,519
tries to fight it naturally and in

401
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:10,159
nature it would be the plant next to it

402
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,480
or itself I guess but the plant next to

403
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,000
it catches PM it's not likely to catch

404
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,000
it as well because it's going to spread

405
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,240
over right that's my whole idea with it

406
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,679
got it yeah you're actually the first

407
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,680
person I've ever heard of uh doing it

408
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,439
that way it's pretty interesting it

409
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:27,039
reminds me of I had a buddy in

410
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,639
Massachusetts who grew out chillo G

411
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,159
along with a whole bunch of other plants

412
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,680
and he always struggles with high

413
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:36,719
humidity and unfortunately a lot of his

414
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,799
plants got powdery mildew but the chill

415
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,839
out OG which was in the same room didn't

416
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,958
get it he's like dude I need to show you

417
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:45,000
this look this is resistant to powdery

418
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,719
Milo I'm like dude that's awesome I'm

419
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,839
glad you got at least one plant that

420
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,800
wasn't infected and I happy that it was

421
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,720
actually the strain that I bred so

422
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,399
appreciate you sharing that with me but

423
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,079
yeah it is something that I know that

424
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,078
quite a few Growers do look for

425
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:00,318
resistance to pathogens such as a

426
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,039
powdery Milo so I'm glad you brought

427
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:03,278
that up I do want to back up to

428
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,558
temperature to kind of get a little bit

429
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,919
more into detail on that one talking

430
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:09,759
about heat blasting with heat what

431
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,600
temperature what what heat do you go up

432
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:15,759
to in order to see if the plan is

433
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:17,798
stressed or not uh around the 96 to 98

434
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:21,640
Zone cuz I don't want to push too past

435
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:23,879
too far past 98 because most things will

436
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,439
burn at 98 regardless you know what I

437
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,439
mean so like that's really that that

438
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:29,519
maximum threshold and I only keep it

439
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,279
there for

440
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:36,400
like maybe 5 minutes tops and then I'll

441
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:39,160
bring it back down and that's just to

442
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,798
like how do I explain this if you look

443
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,600
out in nature right nature is always

444
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:45,440
different the light the pen like the

445
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,558
light penetration that we're getting

446
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,440
from the Sun is always different no

447
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:52,038
matter what throughout the day it will

448
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,038
change right and so at certain peaks in

449
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:56,240
the day there might be times that that

450
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:58,200
there's super hot heat just beaming down

451
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,599
on you you know what I mean and so I'm

452
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,600
trying to like like keep it as natural

453
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:05,038
as

454
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,879
possible um without going too far

455
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,359
because I know when like like I said if

456
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,120
you if you push the limits too far

457
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:13,399
that's just unnatural and what once you

458
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,918
start pushing the unnatural limits

459
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,400
what's the point of what you're doing

460
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:20,280
because if if I sit here and try to like

461
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,519
find a plant that goes up to 10 and

462
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:25,119
something you know so some crazy

463
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:26,759
number okay that's cool and all but in

464
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,519
my eyes it's kind of a waste of time

465
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:30,240
because whoever is going to really like

466
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:32,079
you know going to find that you're not

467
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,000
going to find a single moment in time

468
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:36,918
that outside where your surface

469
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,200
temperature is going to be over like 120

470
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:40,960
degrees or something you know what I

471
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,880
mean it's crazy yeah I know one of the

472
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,159
things that folks look for when they're

473
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,840
doing heat stress is they look for

474
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:48,720
plants to flip over and show intersex

475
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:50,720
traits right for Maite plants they're

476
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,960
looking for the the uh plant to

477
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,960
potentially show nanners right and

478
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,240
breeders in particular they will just

479
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,000
scrap that plant they'll call it off and

480
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,159
they won't use it for future breeding

481
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,720
projects also looking for certain types

482
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:06,880
of fox tailing cuz there's certain

483
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,480
strains that after uh heat is induced

484
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,919
there's a lot of fox tailing that will

485
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,240
incur I'm trying to find the one that

486
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,480
won't you know what I mean because like

487
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,000
I like Fox tailing sometimes because it

488
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:22,000
looks cool but otherwise for your

489
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,359
overall like production as nah you know

490
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,279
what I mean I know there are mixed

491
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,000
opinions on Fox tailing some people hate

492
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,000
it some people feel like it leads to a

493
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,839
more AER structure some people like a

494
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,279
bag appeel others love it uh I know some

495
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:36,279
people who wash and they uh they said

496
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:39,678
they get a better result washing because

497
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:41,918
of uh more looser areer buds coming from

498
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,640
the fox tales and so yeah we got people

499
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,679
who love it people people who hate them

500
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:49,480
so I thought that was kind of funny yeah

501
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:52,000
no it's fun to fun to look at in my eyes

502
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,400
but otherwise besides that uh that's not

503
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,759
for me yeah me living in the desert I

504
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,480
encounter it quite a bit it's sometimes

505
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:02,798
tough specifically in the summertime it

506
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,679
always reaches

507
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:08,798
80° F and I'm lucky to keep it you know

508
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:10,759
under 82 degrees F sometimes it creeps

509
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,759
up a little bit more than that lately uh

510
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:14,119
you know in the new household here I

511
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:16,599
just moved in here I little bit better

512
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:18,839
of cooling situation so I am able to

513
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:21,678
control the temps but my last place man

514
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:23,439
it was touching 86 plus degrees and I'd

515
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,320
see a lot of fox tailing happening on on

516
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,960
some genetics because of that not all

517
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,399
genetics will fox tail but definitely a

518
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,440
good amount will

519
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,038
and uh yeah he definitely contri can

520
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,840
contribute to that also I know infrared

521
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:39,798
light excess infrared light I think uh

522
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:42,798
5% or more 7% or more can actually lead

523
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:44,319
to Fox hang as well the uh ES300 LED

524
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:46,400
grill light by Green Sunshine Company

525
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,918
you know rest in peace that uh company

526
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,080
no longer exists but that was a very

527
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,880
popular light and their first version

528
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,519
had a lot of ir in it and so a lot of

529
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,120
genetics were Fox selling because of it

530
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:58,200
and people were like what the heck's

531
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:00,479
going on so he revised he put out a V2

532
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,919
with actually less IR in it and that

533
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,519
actually helped to solve the problem

534
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,400
there so figur that was worthy of

535
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,558
mentioning okay so we talked about

536
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,519
temperature you kind of said a few

537
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:12,158
things for lighting but if we can get

538
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:14,558
deeper into that amount of light and

539
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,520
spectrum of light some people will just

540
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:18,278
blast it with excess light to try to

541
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:20,960
stress their plants other people will

542
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:23,000
give certain Spectrum in order to stress

543
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,079
the plant what do you typically do in

544
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,200
regards to light stress both I do a lot

545
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:31,399
of uh I switch between I have a bunch of

546
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,798
Lights I have the what are they called

547
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:38,960
the bulb lights HPS and MH HS HPS sorry

548
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:43,240
there's too many too many abbreviations

549
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:47,798
man the HPS I have a th000 watt of that

550
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:50,278
I run that in a 4x4 okay that's a lot

551
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:52,200
Max that out that's a lot right um whole

552
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:54,519
lot of heat coming off that thing so I'm

553
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,798
constantly running an AC bi it to try to

554
00:21:54,519 --> 00:22:00,839
keep them temperatures I 100% understand

555
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:03,278
what you mean I live a high desert so in

556
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:05,240
the in summertime I feel you on that

557
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:07,000
like when I don't want it too high it

558
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,400
starts reaching up in them higher levels

559
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,880
so I'm like okay I guess we're doing a

560
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:17,038
higher test today you know um I do

561
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,000
switch it between that and led I have an

562
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:22,079
LED

563
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,960
650 um Mars

564
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:27,399
Hydro Crank that and I swap them in

565
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,880
between the Mars Hydro I bring closer to

566
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:33,720
the plant um because I don't know I I I

567
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,600
heard it I heard it back in the day that

568
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,798
it's just it's a good thing to do like

569
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,558
you could run them closer and like some

570
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:42,960
I don't know I just stick to what I know

571
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:44,960
yeah but I keep switching in between

572
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,720
that because of that same that same

573
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,079
sentence that I was saying earlier like

574
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,400
go outside you never get the same type

575
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:56,798
of light penetration I'll say you know

576
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:59,159
so switching between LED and hid so you

577
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:01,038
got the different spectrums there now do

578
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:03,640
you have a par meter are you measuring

579
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:05,359
the amount of light that is being

580
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,360
emitted onto the plant and then are you

581
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:10,558
increasing that to see if it stresses

582
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:14,038
his plan or not I had a par meter broke

583
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:17,038
it um so I started using the app on the

584
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:18,558
the what is it the photon Photon app I

585
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:19,879
think with piece of you know with the

586
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:22,879
piece of paper and

587
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,720
everything I don't trust that so I'm

588
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,600
currently trying to get a new one but

589
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,440
yeah I usually do test it um

590
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:33,158
what is

591
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,159
it the or is it a bricks me bricks meter

592
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:38,120
I think it's a bricks meter bricks

593
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,440
refractometer yeah I think that's what I

594
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:42,839
think that's what I had I can't sorry

595
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:47,480
I'm bad with

596
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:49,959
names yeah but I do I do I have a big

597
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:54,079
sheet if I should have brought that I

598
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,400
should have brought that I'm sorry dang

599
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,918
always messing up on something I usually

600
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,600
every show every it doesn't matter what

601
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,679
I'm doing at least one one thing I

602
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,199
forget like to bring um I was going to

603
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:05,840
bring the sheet so I can tell you

604
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,558
literally like I have a chart that I

605
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,278
write down everything so like this month

606
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:11,359
I'm running this and this were the

607
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:13,679
results you know always taking notes

608
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:16,798
because if I don't take notes then how

609
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:20,559
am I going to know you know and I re

610
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:22,720
well it's about about a month I recently

611
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:24,960
switched to stop taking notes and

612
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,759
actually recording so I can see the

613
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,720
entire plant and I can like literally

614
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:34,278
have the evidence of what's Happening go

615
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,679
through um time date it and then that's

616
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:39,480
technically my notes now it can be so

617
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:41,399
helpful to take videos and pictures and

618
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,919
have those as your notes or

619
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:47,599
documentation right so I have been

620
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,320
filming my plants for nine years now and

621
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,639
I can look back on my hard drive and see

622
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:55,480
the plants that I grew back in

623
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:57,399
2015 and uh it's it's interesting to see

624
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,880
the different growth and like remind

625
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:02,798
myself of what that look like how it

626
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,640
grew so on and so forth one mistake I

627
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:08,200
made is actually organizing that footage

628
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,080
instead of doing like

629
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,519
2015 Vlog one Vlog two Vlog three and

630
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:15,558
just dumping footage in there of all

631
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:17,759
different plants I had to go back and

632
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:20,359
organize into different folders by

633
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:22,200
strain really or cultivar and so that

634
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:24,278
way I can look and see okay when I grew

635
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,558
up the gelato 41 backcross let me look

636
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:27,640
into that folder and I can see

637
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:29,359
everything about that versus trying to

638
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,320
dig back at a a certain year at a

639
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:34,359
certain Vlog number so I learned my

640
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,278
lesson on that one but I totally get

641
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:38,759
what you mean by filming or taking

642
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:41,720
pictures of it how that can be helpful I

643
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:45,000
just kept losing all my notes I I had uh

644
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,880
used to have a what are those

645
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,519
uh you know the books that don't have

646
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,600
the the wire going around it um and

647
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,759
they're usually like black and white

648
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:57,558
yeah those like perfect binding ones or

649
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:00,119
I think they're perfect binding that

650
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:03,079
yeah binder yeah you know which one I'm

651
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:05,239
talking about had a stack like this of

652
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:07,639
all my notes that I've been taking I

653
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,278
lost half that stack and and multiple

654
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,038
moves and so dang I got to start

655
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:13,720
recording stuff cuz I just put it on a

656
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:15,919
cloud and then I always have access to

657
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,399
it you know what I mean there you go yep

658
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,919
that would work great okay let's get

659
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:23,519
into drought stress next so do you do

660
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:24,720
any type of drought stress if so how do

661
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,480
you do it and what do you look for in

662
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:33,000
the plant so with my drought stressing I

663
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:38,519
do pure cocoa right and then I will

664
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,798
water it one day let it let it run stop

665
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:42,079
about the third day the third day is

666
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:43,839
when it's really going to need your

667
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,839
water you're going to start seeing that

668
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:49,240
that droop down if you gave it that full

669
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:52,959
saturation on that third day on what is

670
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:54,759
it I'm running in three gallons right on

671
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,600
that third day you should start seeing

672
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:58,359
your your plant drooping down a little

673
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:01,839
bit that's when you know that that's

674
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:03,959
that's about how how long you can go so

675
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,359
I will stretch it farther and farther

676
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,159
and then start seeing what plants are re

677
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:10,479
reacting the most and at that time

678
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:12,679
that's that's the ones that I'll start

679
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,000
breeding with the ones that are more

680
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:16,679
resilient to that I'll take that plant

681
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,159
cuz I want that and I'll breed it and

682
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:20,480
I'll try to find that trait in that

683
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,960
plant again the next cycle and you just

684
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,120
keep doing that um the idea is just to

685
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,759
find something that I could potentially

686
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:32,359
water it this one day and then go with

687
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:35,759
maybe like a 4 to 5 day stretch without

688
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:38,879
watering and it still be just barely at

689
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:41,440
that droopy Point that's like the real

690
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,600
Pinnacle of what I'm looking for because

691
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,000
with that then it gives people the time

692
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:47,839
period of say you have to go to work and

693
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,038
you can't really go into your garden

694
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,798
it's okay tomorrow just catch back up

695
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:53,679
onto it you know what I mean and so it

696
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:56,480
gives you plant a little bit more time

697
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:59,159
and more leniency for neglect you know

698
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,759
what I mean cuz

699
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,320
the whole reason honestly like I got

700
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:05,278
into growing was I watched my mom um

701
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:07,839
when I was a little kid I she used to

702
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,278
love gardening uh she just used to be

703
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:11,480
mad all the time because she did not

704
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,679
have a green thumb and bless her soul

705
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,519
she tried so much but she would forget

706
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,159
to water it and that was the main issue

707
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,839
for her you know what I mean and so I

708
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,919
always wanted to find a plant that was

709
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:25,359
like super resilient to it like Cactus

710
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,960
you know a cactus cactus cactus what is

711
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,000
it there's a couple of them but like

712
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,120
Cactus is the most notorious those live

713
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,798
out in the desert go Forever Without

714
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,798
Water you know what I mean still do

715
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:37,000
perfectly fine have juices running in

716
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,759
them like come on be ideal pretty

717
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,319
straightforward there now on the flip

718
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:43,599
side flooding is the type of St really

719
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:45,639
overwatering a lot of people call it

720
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:48,038
instead adding so much water in there

721
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,080
that the medium's oversaturated do you

722
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:51,440
do any of that stress if so how do you

723
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:55,199
do it and what do you look for in the

724
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:58,600
plant actually I do that one with my bug

725
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,080
stress um with the fungus Nets

726
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:02,839
because when you get all that excess Mo

727
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:05,079
like moisture in your medium that's

728
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:07,519
really what you're those

729
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:10,119
little sorry I'm almost SAR that's what

730
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:10,798
those little bugs like I I do not like

731
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:14,079
those

732
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:15,879
things pain and pain to keep it like

733
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:17,879
contained they always

734
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,360
spread but

735
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:24,760
um I actually do that and it really just

736
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:27,240
goes back in that same basis like you

737
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:30,278
can find that there's more plants that

738
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,120
when you are watering them uh more

739
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:34,240
excessively you'll start getting a bunch

740
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:36,558
of like toxicities and stuff depending

741
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,319
on what your feed is and stuff like that

742
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:39,879
you'll start running into all kinds of

743
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:43,119
issues like the plant will start turning

744
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:45,760
all kinds of colors right um that

745
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:48,639
actually leads me into like the cold cuz

746
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:51,079
I do cold as well the cold temps I try

747
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,038
to water with colder water sometimes as

748
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:55,558
well to see you know which one's going

749
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:58,398
to react the most I'm trying to avoid

750
00:29:55,558 --> 00:30:02,000
the purpling in our medical plants I

751
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:03,599
know it does it in um the Tomato

752
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
sometimes does the

753
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:09,240
purpling uh there's a couple other

754
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,599
plants that it does it as well but yeah

755
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,839
let's move on to Salt stress do you do

756
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:16,599
this at all if so how do you do it and

757
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:20,398
what do you look for in the plant so I

758
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:22,918
don't have a a meter technically to read

759
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:27,119
my salts I really just run at a higher

760
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:29,000
uh PPM PPM or EC is a lot of people

761
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:32,518
measure by those yeah yeah yeah I just

762
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,960
run at a a lot higher one for that that

763
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:38,240
test so like I'll push into the threes

764
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:41,919
and fours instead of like the average

765
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:45,159
1.6 you know I'll try to get as high as

766
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:47,240
high high as I can I'll stack um do a

767
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:49,720
lot of bottom feeding for that that type

768
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:53,640
of test to try to pull up the salts so

769
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,360
they stay in there and Stack Up um

770
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,639
that's mainly how I do that as the

771
00:30:55,359 --> 00:31:00,439
plant's growing are you looking for like

772
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:02,158
EX ively dark leaves curling nitrogen

773
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,840
toxicity for example and then are you

774
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,200
like culling off the plants that aren't

775
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:10,000
able to handle that high you see or what

776
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:12,759
100% yeah there's uh you you literally

777
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,079
what you said literally all of those the

778
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:17,278
um the nitrogen is M mainly the one that

779
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:19,759
I'm looking for though because I find

780
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:21,679
that the nitrogen issue is the biggest

781
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:23,720
issue in my eyes that a lot of like home

782
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,200
Growers deal with because they don't

783
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,360
pull off the nitrogen when they're

784
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,840
supposed to and so they start like

785
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:32,319
having excesses of it and that's where

786
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:34,439
the issues start lying in and really

787
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:36,879
that's that is literally what I am

788
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,880
searching for when it comes to that that

789
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,440
that stress test got it and I know

790
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,200
running higher EC can actually stunt the

791
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,720
growth as well so the plant might look

792
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,399
nice and green and healthy but like just

793
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,480
stays it just it stays squat right it

794
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:53,239
stays the growth has been stunted so I

795
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,440
assume that's another thing you look for

796
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,440
MH yep they just do not move

797
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,480
yeah literally

798
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,320
been two weeks nothing and just sits

799
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,159
there looking healthy yeah yeah no no

800
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,240
that one gets me sometimes too because

801
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,159
like I have so much going on and I'll go

802
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,880
in there check on it all right so this

803
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,240
test is working this T come back okay

804
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,120
it's working and then come back again

805
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:21,798
wait a second okay wait a second you you

806
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:24,719
guys aren't moving yeah no like yeah

807
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:26,679
that gives me all the time reminds me of

808
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,960
my hydroponic grow the first one I've

809
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:31,120
ever done I've grown in soil for 14

810
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,240
years and then just tried hydro and uh

811
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:35,199
one thing I've learned is from somebody

812
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,720
else they had mentioned that sure you

813
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,278
can try to run a higher AC you're not

814
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:43,679
really going to see nutrient burn as you

815
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:46,839
would in soil like it's not as apparent

816
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,038
but you'll see more of a slowed growth

817
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:50,038
and that's exactly what when I was

818
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:52,638
reaching these higher ECS touching

819
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:54,558
upward of 2.0 EC some people say that's

820
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:56,479
excessive for running in Hydro deep

821
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:58,000
water culture to be more specific people

822
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,519
said you can get away with the smaller

823
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
one and any higher than that you could

824
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:05,000
actually see stunting so I actually

825
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,480
backed off and went down in order to try

826
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,038
to prevent that stunt of growth from

827
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,679
happening that's literally why I'm

828
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:11,079
trying to get into soil and stuff

829
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,720
because it does give you that quicker

830
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:17,960
reading on that um I shout out to bobiz

831
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,440
because bobiz is really they hooked me

832
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,840
up with a starter kit of uh they have

833
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,519
some liquid organic nutrients so I'm

834
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:28,519
going to try that see see what that's

835
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:31,798
all about and run a couple test see what

836
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:34,720
happens super excited awesome let's move

837
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:36,679
on to Mechanical stress so things that

838
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,399
fall under this would be like pruning

839
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:42,440
for example training transplanting do

840
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:45,719
you do any of those things yes I do I do

841
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:49,000
the pruning so normally I will prune it

842
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,319
at your sixth Sho right um most plants

843
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,119
once it gets like it's sixth Sho you

844
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:55,398
prune it there so it gets a little bit

845
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,479
more growth and then you naturally prune

846
00:33:55,398 --> 00:34:00,000
it depending on what type of plants that

847
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,200
it is um it's depending on really how

848
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,200
much you want to prune it but in the

849
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:09,599
medical

850
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:12,398
plant six sh six shoot 2 weeks um after

851
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,240
that and then 2 weeks before you flip it

852
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:17,799
into flower that is really the standard

853
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:20,678
that I've ran by um but when it comes to

854
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:23,399
the test I'll I will prune that I'll

855
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:25,519
prune it every week just to see and and

856
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:27,878
really what I'm looking for is it to

857
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:32,039
Herm out when I push it into flour

858
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:35,598
because that's like a common one

859
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:38,279
um lack of lack of development like

860
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,720
you'll get a lot of like like tops and

861
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,839
stuff but like they'll just be little

862
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:44,358
guys little guys and um that's something

863
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:47,039
that

864
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:49,239
I again if I see those two things I'll

865
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:52,079
kill them off um I'm really looking for

866
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:53,918
something I can prune as often as uh

867
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,359
there's a bush that's like a Bonsai I

868
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,759
can't remember what it's

869
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:59,039
called a awesome little Bush you have to

870
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,000
you have to prune that thing all the

871
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:04,239
time though because it it it grows crazy

872
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,440
um and I'm looking for something like

873
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:10,118
that because if we can get that type of

874
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,159
vigor right in the plant and still be

875
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:16,760
able to prune it top it get it like just

876
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:19,679
just constantly chopping at it right and

877
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,359
the idea is we get it like that we get

878
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:24,519
massive yields off that one plant

879
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:26,559
because we can train it easily easily

880
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:28,920
right B bend your branches down and like

881
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,880
your wise so they come down get plenty

882
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,159
of crazy tops everywhere and it'll just

883
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,720
be amazing but a lot of plants can't

884
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:37,440
handle that kind of training yeah I've

885
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:40,319
seen some people do some crazy things

886
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,240
when it comes to training and Topping

887
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,680
stripping down all the leaves to

888
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:46,559
foliation and really just having it

889
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:49,639
mostly naked take almost every single

890
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:51,358
leaf off of the plant B flipping flower

891
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:52,598
and let that thing grow back and

892
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:53,799
sometimes you don't even think that the

893
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:56,519
plant is going to

894
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,920
survive and uh you see their progress

895
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:01,400
weeks later and the plant grows just

896
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,880
fine so it's pretty interesting to see

897
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,400
kind of how much you can actually take

898
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,000
off the plant and how it rebounds and is

899
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,119
able to grow and get to harvest from it

900
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,760
yeah like uh the what is it the swazi

901
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,680
swas

902
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,200
methoding however however it's

903
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:20,159
pronounced right um I like that but I

904
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:22,239
like pushing it a little bit farther

905
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:25,118
like really pushing it to its real Max

906
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:28,479
just to see how far I can go to push

907
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:32,519
that specific genetic or or or strain

908
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,838
right um to it Max that's the best way I

909
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:37,440
can put it because like you were saying

910
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:38,920
like even at even at commercial

911
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,240
facilities that is one of the funnest

912
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,838
things to do teaching people how to like

913
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:45,519
cut back a mom or something like that

914
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:47,880
sometimes just go over there grab the

915
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:50,519
plant little bundle it up and then take

916
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:53,480
go down half of it take some loppers and

917
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:55,800
chop half of it off it looks disgusting

918
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,880
the plant looks like it's going to die

919
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,440
everybody freaks out the first time see

920
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:04,880
it and like just give it a little bit

921
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:07,280
comes back even bigger like I love that

922
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,119
but if we can start that at a at a a

923
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,599
younger like age in the plants

924
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:16,480
development and it not

925
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:19,400
have detrimental like problems then

926
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,679
that's what I'm really looking for like

927
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:25,039
that would be key that's a keeper for

928
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:26,318
you huh mhm 100% I want to go back to

929
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:28,199
another thing that you spoke about which

930
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:30,679
is the fungus Nets how you take taken

931
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:33,159
soil from a commercial facility that had

932
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:34,559
fungus gats introducing into your garden

933
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:36,838
what exactly you trying to get out of

934
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:39,000
doing that all right I'm going try to

935
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,880
get into the science of this you bear

936
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,318
with

937
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:47,039
me all right so plants when they are

938
00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:51,639
being attacked by certain types of pests

939
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:54,279
they uh what is it e ethyl methylene I

940
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:56,000
can never remember remember the actual

941
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,160
chemical that it starts to produce the

942
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,400
plant will produce this this chemical

943
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:03,759
right to try to F fight them off and in

944
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:06,240
doing so it usually results in like a

945
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:09,040
higher tarpine yield and so something

946
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,879
something along that sort right

947
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,199
depending on what type of insects that

948
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,800
you are really introducing is really

949
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:19,358
depending on what type of um we'll say

950
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,800
pheromone pathogen I I I can't never

951
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:23,679
remember the name of it sorry I gets me

952
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,240
every time but the idea is you build

953
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:27,960
that resistance and that resistance is

954
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:30,838
shown in your

955
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,000
uction um in certain types of oil

956
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:34,400
development I hope I'm saying that right

957
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,079
and you can correct me if I'm wrong

958
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,400
could be wrong with that one that one is

959
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,599
really just a newer test that I've been

960
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,480
I've been playing with you know what I

961
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:45,079
mean yeah I've never heard of the the

962
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,039
people introducing fungus nets for a

963
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:48,760
stress now when you introduce them and

964
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:50,838
they're you know you got the population

965
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,079
going say you're done with the test how

966
00:38:50,838 --> 00:38:57,639
do you get rid of the fungus nuts I like

967
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:58,400
a zerol um cuz it it really works as

968
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:01,358
like

969
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,838
a what is it called a

970
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:06,920
sterilizer it is zerol 2.0 is what I

971
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:10,559
really keep keep I keep a gallon of that

972
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:12,760
thing around um it's essentially like a

973
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:15,599
peroxide just a high concentrated

974
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:18,560
version of peroxide and you keep that

975
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:22,480
down throw all everything away you spray

976
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:25,880
everything down clean everything bleach

977
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,559
everything um the buckets clean those

978
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,519
out make sure that the soil that that

979
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:33,078
you are has been contaminated make sure

980
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:35,759
you bring that away from your home

981
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:39,039
facility wherever you're doing your test

982
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,319
do not do not let that stay sit around

983
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:42,079
because if it sits around and there's

984
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:45,159
still moisture in it then they just keep

985
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,079
breeding and it will spread and good

986
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:50,118
luck after that point you're a brave man

987
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,519
for introducing fungus knots

988
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:54,200
intentionally and doing the the uh

989
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:55,838
stress testing because me personally I

990
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:58,439
struggle with fungus Nets and I just

991
00:39:55,838 --> 00:40:00,279
want them gone I but I understand what

992
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,039
you're uh what you're going for there

993
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:06,839
what are some challenges when it comes

994
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:06,838
to doing some of these Precision stress

995
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:12,559
techniques

996
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:16,000
well don't think that you're going to

997
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:20,239
have a good yield like your yield is a

998
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,400
big problem um spreading uh any type of

999
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:24,479
cont like contamination that's another

1000
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,160
big problem yeah honestly those are like

1001
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,240
the biggest ones those are like the

1002
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,318
really biggest ones because you burn

1003
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:31,959
through a lot of plans don't like doing

1004
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:35,159
all of these tests and trying to get to

1005
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:38,358
your end result you will will say like

1006
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:41,000
this you do 10 right you're probably

1007
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:42,639
going to keep one if you're lucky if

1008
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,719
you're lucky off that run if you're

1009
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:49,519
lucky off that run right because you

1010
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:53,279
have to St stay with in in a regular um

1011
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:54,838
a regular kind of idea um you have to

1012
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,800
stay

1013
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:59,719
with non feminized stuff

1014
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,920
right because you want to keep that

1015
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:05,598
diversity right so you're going to start

1016
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,400
10 plants maybe one survives so that's

1017
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,359
all 10 plants that you ran throughout

1018
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,440
this entire test that you

1019
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:12,920
probably might have thought that maybe

1020
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,240
one was going to survive you might be

1021
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:18,440
able to smoke so you know

1022
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:21,039
no more often than not your killing

1023
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,318
plants are you starting from seed and

1024
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:26,838
only doing seeds or are you doing clones

1025
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:28,159
as well seeds and clones a lot of seeds

1026
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:30,519
and clones

1027
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:32,960
um specifically like you start off from

1028
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:36,000
your seed to keep that diversity and

1029
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,720
then uh depending on what type of tests

1030
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,760
you want to run you would cut the clone

1031
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:42,639
from that and then cut your clone from

1032
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:46,319
your mail as well so you can keep them

1033
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:49,639
those type those specific genetic you

1034
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:52,000
know pools we'll say genetic pools

1035
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:53,480
together and then once you got your

1036
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,880
clones you take your clones and put them

1037
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,318
in different tests got it so I imagine

1038
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,160
you are letting the pl grow up the from

1039
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:03,279
seed cutting the Clones having the

1040
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:06,078
Clones off to the side pushing some to

1041
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,000
testing right Precision stress testing

1042
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,920
keeping the ones that you've cloned you

1043
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,639
have them kind of separate you're not t

1044
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,559
stressing some and you're stressing the

1045
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:19,879
others or what yep yep the if I if I

1046
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:21,400
start one strain um 100% already know

1047
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,400
from the beginning I'm going to test

1048
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,760
this strain I know for a fact that I'm

1049
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,599
not going to run this for any type of

1050
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,520
medical use or anything this is just for

1051
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:34,318
testing then I will grow that out to

1052
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:36,400
about about yall like L as soon as I got

1053
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,199
like four branches on that plant I will

1054
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,039
cut off three of them and then I'll

1055
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:44,199
leave that one branch um those three

1056
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:46,599
other branches set one to the side the

1057
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:49,279
other the other two right into testing

1058
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:54,480
that main plant right into testing that

1059
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:57,200
one I'll save um as the control cuz you

1060
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,920
got I use that pruning the pruning meth

1061
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,399
method for that first one the mom that

1062
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,800
is that prune that is the one that I

1063
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:07,119
will consistently go back and sit here

1064
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:10,119
and chop away at um one of the plants

1065
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:13,800
I'll push into the PM room the other

1066
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:17,358
plant I'll push into um the bug room and

1067
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,640
then I have the control room understood

1068
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:21,318
that makes sense so the next question I

1069
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:24,480
want to ask as we get towards the end

1070
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:27,519
here what are the top three genetics

1071
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,880
that you've grown as in like for the

1072
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:32,559
resistant traits or just top three that

1073
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,960
I personally enjoy top three in your

1074
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,640
opinion what you enjoy kind of maybe

1075
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,679
name off the The Strain and then uh kind

1076
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:43,639
of what you like about it Afghan because

1077
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:45,719
that is an um that's a really good

1078
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:48,558
drought I've grow I've grown that a

1079
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:50,399
couple times like the original Afghan

1080
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:54,359
not like any of the crossed afghanis

1081
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,838
like the original land race right um I

1082
00:43:54,358 --> 00:43:57,880
found that that one fights a lot of

1083
00:43:55,838 --> 00:43:59,679
droughts and that I think that goes back

1084
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:03,000
to how it was

1085
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:05,358
initially like bred out and found you

1086
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,318
know like they used to grow it in big

1087
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:10,039
fields and then they would flood the

1088
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:12,639
they dig canals right along the the

1089
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:15,039
sides of each each row and then they

1090
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:17,960
just flood it and that's how they did it

1091
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:20,159
um and that that ground would dry out

1092
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,240
often and then they just come back flood

1093
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:25,558
it again

1094
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:28,118
um it builds so many tra it built so

1095
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:30,160
many resistances like I think this is

1096
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:33,000
really why we know it is what it is

1097
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:38,279
today cuz like it works for a lot of

1098
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:41,440
things um another one uh what is it blue

1099
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,359
dreams honestly I like blue dreams um

1100
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,079
not because it's res resiling to

1101
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:47,039
anything it is a pain for a lot of

1102
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:49,760
people to grow like it is not a beginner

1103
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:52,480
strain um in my eyes

1104
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,440
personally um I just like the way it

1105
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,358
tastes it's a good one it's really good

1106
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,240
and then for a third one I like Alaskan

1107
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:02,279
Thunder [ __ ] that every like the the the

1108
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,719
legendary how it's everybody's like no

1109
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,720
it's not real it's not Alaskan you know

1110
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:12,078
I'm looking for it I had it one time and

1111
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:14,159
gold gold got me set classic yeah yeah

1112
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,318
I'm a big lamb race guy nice yeah the

1113
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:16,399
reason why I asked that question is cuz

1114
00:45:15,318 --> 00:45:18,759
we have a lot of people that are tuning

1115
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,960
into this that are shopping for genetics

1116
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,119
and they like to hear what other people

1117
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,639
are growing and their experiences kind

1118
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:26,200
of growing now what they like about

1119
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:28,358
those particular genetics so I

1120
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:29,960
appreciate you revealing that to us now

1121
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:31,598
I'm sure we could go on and on but we're

1122
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,280
going to wrap things up here can you

1123
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,359
tell the listeners how they can find you

1124
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,319
and what you have upcoming in the future

1125
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:40,119
uh you can find me on YouTube Instagram

1126
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:42,400
really honestly any platform I'm

1127
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:44,240
everywhere I stay I try to stay in touch

1128
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,358
with the community as much as

1129
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:49,479
possible um I got a bunch of bunch of

1130
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:52,598
events that I'm about to be starting up

1131
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:55,000
uh grow alongs competitions you know all

1132
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:57,838
kinds of stuff like that so make sure to

1133
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,760
follow it's going to be crazy

1134
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,679
again thank you for having me awesome

1135
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,480
