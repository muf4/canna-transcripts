00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,000
doing today I'm doing great Chris thanks

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,719
for having me yeah thanks for coming on

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,719
today we're going to talk all about crop

71
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,280
steering so you actually reached out to

72
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,359
me several months ago and wanted to be

73
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,840
on the podcast to talk shop and I like

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,440
talking shop and you gave me some

75
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,680
suggestions for things that we could

76
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,919
kind of get into and lots of good topics

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,519
to choose from but I really narrowed it

78
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,839
down to that crop steering one because I

79
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,920
think that's becoming more and more

80
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,878
popular these days amongst folks I get

81
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,759
more and more questions about it and

82
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:05,359
yeah figured we would dive into that one

83
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,199
this time around and talk about your

84
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,480
experience doing it but first can you

85
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,719
tell us a little bit about yourself and

86
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:14,280
how you got into gardening yeah

87
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,680
absolutely um so uh the way that I got

88
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,080
into gardening was actually through

89
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,719
growing and I'll

90
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,080
explain um I think that my story and why

91
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:26,759
I started growing is very relatable I

92
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,400
think to most Growers that are coming um

93
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:33,438
that are coming into the uh the scene

94
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,239
nowaday and they're they're going to um

95
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:37,639
they're going to dispensaries and they

96
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,640
are having really poor experience after

97
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:43,958
Poor experience and they're overpaying

98
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,079
for product that is overdried and it's

99
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:49,120
and it's rushed to the shelves and it's

100
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,360
stale and it's flavorless and it's it

101
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,879
has no effects and you're spending

102
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,439
hundreds thousands of dollars and at a

103
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:01,120
certain point you say enough is enough

104
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:04,799
and fortunately Illinois went legal back

105
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,200
in 2020 and that was when I decided to

106
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,760
jump on board with it and I did like

107
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:14,158
most people and I went and Googled uh

108
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:16,560
you know best place to buy seeds and

109
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:20,798
Best Equipment and and all those things

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,478
and was ushered into you know the uh the

111
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,079
Corrals that are in place with SEO to

112
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:27,519
make sure that you're landing on white

113
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:29,038
labeled seed banks and and the and the

114
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:34,639
the big brands that are paying the top

115
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:36,519
dollar for o so um I like many went went

116
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,840
and bought all of those those

117
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:42,879
recommendations and and had uh really

118
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:46,519
poor results actually surprise surprise

119
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:49,680
uh with with the first couple runs but I

120
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:52,079
really enjoyed the the growing aspect of

121
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,560
it the N the nurturing for something

122
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,680
living and it inspired a curiosity in me

123
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,160
to want to get better at this and that's

124
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,519
kind of just in my nature to when I pick

125
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,800
up a hobby I want to be the best at it

126
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:09,198
um or the best that I can be and uh I

127
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,639
went through exhaust of lengths to to

128
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,400
get more knowledgeable on this plant and

129
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:18,519
start to understand it at a biological

130
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:21,679
level and It ultimately led me to living

131
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:24,478
soil and uh specifically Bill the soil

132
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,918
and and Jeremy Silva um I really

133
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:30,519
gravitated towards his message and um it

134
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:34,839
really aligned with who I am as a as a

135
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:38,399
person and um I started digging deeper

136
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:40,519
and deeper into living soil and that's

137
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,758
what led me to gardening because

138
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:47,318
gardening is to me in my mind is a much

139
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:50,199
more it's a uh it's it's a much broader

140
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:53,919
term um and to me there's a spiritual

141
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:56,800
element to it as well but uh I started

142
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:59,279
growing all sorts of things outside and

143
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,160
we my wife and I collect house plants

144
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,318
and

145
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,600
we amassed this huge collection of house

146
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:08,000
plants that we had to you know dwindle

147
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,840
down to just the the rare and exotic

148
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,478
ones because you know everybody can go

149
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:15,399
get a snake plant or you know all you

150
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,839
know money trees and things like that um

151
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:20,439
but uh it so the the gardening has

152
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:23,359
stemmed from growing medicinal plants

153
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:25,800
indoors and um I've I've taken the grows

154
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,199
out doors and it is deep in my

155
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,439
connection with nature my appreciation

156
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,360
for the balance that uh that exists in

157
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:35,319
nature and uh it's really just been a

158
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,479
beautiful Evolution so uh yeah it was

159
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:40,199
really just a a constant dissatisfaction

160
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:43,478
with the dispensary Market that led me

161
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,720
to growing my own medicinal herbs which

162
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:47,879
led to you know gardening many other

163
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,720
things fruits and vegetables and flowers

164
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:51,918
things that bring me a lot of Joy that's

165
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,400
awesome and I know you've gone so far to

166
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,439
do a couple different things in the

167
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:57,719
industry that's notable number one a

168
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,959
podcast you've got the Growers hangout

169
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,720
you're a part of that one if you can

170
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,719
talk about that for and then also the

171
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,960
crop culture box can you talk to us

172
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,240
about those things yes absolutely thank

173
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:12,000
you uh so um I started a podcast weekly

174
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,680
every Tuesday with my friend Aaron um

175
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,399
support dope people and Pete of heisen

176
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:21,720
tur brothers and it is a

177
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:25,519
community-based uh platform where we uh

178
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:28,000
you know try to provide value to to our

179
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:31,198
uh viewers and we're trying to bring

180
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,240
guests and experts on that um you know

181
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,759
are bringing a unique perspective and uh

182
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,240
it really does cater to newer Growers

183
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,960
and uh not to say that uh you know

184
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,478
experienced Growers can't find benefit

185
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,758
we've had people like miles from weed to

186
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:47,560
taste good uh speaking about living soil

187
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,840
and fermented plant extracts and we've

188
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,959
had Eric from Thrive Yahweh who came on

189
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:55,038
and talked about the value of laop

190
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:58,120
bacillus and uh and his products and it

191
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:00,439
was just an amazing Deep dive into the

192
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,879
science of it and

193
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:06,319
it's it's been a really a really fun

194
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,000
thing to do uh to be able to share the

195
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,080
things that I do in my garden the things

196
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,079
that I've uh experienced a positive

197
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:16,240
benefit from with people to uh to see if

198
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:19,198
that's something that they would like to

199
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,199
adopt and uh and do it themselves and as

200
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,520
it relates to uh the crop culture box so

201
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,840
crop culture again was uh again again

202
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,758
stemming from that uh that whole

203
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:34,079
dispensary thing and when I started

204
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:36,080
growing I as a collector myself uh pop

205
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,080
culture being a very important part of

206
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:43,519
my life being a a child of the 80s um

207
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,720
and being you know growing up through I

208
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,759
don't even think it's arguably the most

209
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:53,360
um profound uh time in American history

210
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:55,120
when it came to pop culture and um I

211
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,079
incorporate a lot of those things into

212
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:02,959
the business so what crop culture is um

213
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:06,199
is a premium uh thoughtfully curated

214
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:08,838
Growers box that releases quarterly

215
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,759
their theme boxes where I partner with

216
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,000
the the best breeders in the industry

217
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,720
and the best brands in the industry and

218
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,879
I do the research to make sure that

219
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,639
these are the best products and these

220
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:24,240
are things that get my stample stamp of

221
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:26,199
approval and um I am able to leverage um

222
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,680
you know wholesale pricing with my

223
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,519
partners and I pass those savings along

224
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:35,838
to my customers these boxes are truly uh

225
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:38,320
an unbeatable value and the reason why

226
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,839
I'm able to do this is because I have uh

227
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,000
I have a really good day job that I'm

228
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,519
very fortunate for that it pays the

229
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,958
bills and it affords me the opportunity

230
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:50,440
to kind of do this as a uh a creative

231
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:52,159
Venture and uh give back to the

232
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,640
community which I feel is given so much

233
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:57,199
to me and um not being a very

234
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:00,000
financially driven person I would rather

235
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,160
pack more value into the box because at

236
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,278
the end of the day I want something that

237
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:07,199
I would be excited about I have a very I

238
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:09,439
have very Discerning taste and I want

239
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,640
every single person to open their box

240
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,839
and be blown away by what they received

241
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:17,759
and you always are going to get much

242
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,800
more than what uh you know what I

243
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,559
advertise I always under promise and

244
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:25,120
overd deliver um and I work with a lot

245
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,599
of upand cominging breeders as well they

246
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,639
might not be the featured breeder for

247
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,079
the Box because I have to leverage

248
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:34,439
recognition and things like that um but

249
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:37,479
I I they send me packs and it's a

250
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,880
platform to to help them grow as well

251
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,800
and and share their genetics with people

252
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:44,519
and uh get them you know engaging with

253
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,639
these breeders and helping them grow so

254
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,399
it's really been a a beautiful way to

255
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:53,278
harmoniously bring together breeders and

256
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,278
Brands and um it's not a competitive

257
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,078
thing it is just this everybody can

258
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,278
benefit from it awesome good stuff there

259
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:00,759
all right let's get into the topic

260
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:04,360
before people start complaining in the

261
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:06,639
comment section let's do it crop

262
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,919
steering break it down for us a lot of

263
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:12,399
beginners tune into my show as well what

264
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:15,479
is crop steering yeah so crop steering

265
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,240
in a nutshell is taking um the way that

266
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,000
we refer to it is taking your indoor

267
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,879
garden and altering the variables of

268
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,879
your lighting your climate and your

269
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:31,639
irrigation to steer the outcome of your

270
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:34,799
plans and uh your phytochemical uh

271
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:38,399
profiles in your in your plants so your

272
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:40,599
uh your canabo flavonoids T Turpin we

273
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:45,120
are trying to

274
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:47,079
influence yield and flavor and potency

275
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,759
essentially with crop steering and then

276
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:52,159
there's a couple different types there's

277
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,399
vegetative steering and then generative

278
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,838
steering first off what is vegetative

279
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,799
steering what is meant by that

280
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,079
vegetative steering and the difference

281
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:04,240
between that and um generative steering

282
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:06,719
is generative steering is uh triggering

283
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,919
the light cycle for photo period plants

284
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,399
so this is where you are uh you are in

285
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,958
an indoor environment switching your

286
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,159
light cycle to 12 hours on 12 hours off

287
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:18,559
to trigger that flowering cycle there

288
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,958
are things that you can also do with

289
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:25,039
that light cycle in terms of the light

290
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:29,000
duration and intensity to also influence

291
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,679
the the outcome of uh of your plants but

292
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,039
um

293
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,359
with in the vegetative uh in vegetative

294
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:38,838
steering this is where we are going to

295
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:42,480
be adjusting inputs like our humidity

296
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:46,320
and um our lighting to and as well as

297
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:49,360
our irrigation to influence how our

298
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,399
plant grows how vigorously it grows

299
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,480
there are ways to slow down growth if

300
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:57,278
you're like me and a really bad at

301
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:00,039
planting your grows and sometimes run

302
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,919
into a situation where you have small

303
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:05,198
plants that you don't have anywhere to

304
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:08,958
put and you have to wait for your tents

305
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:12,359
to open up there are ways that you could

306
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:14,838
safely and do it without minimal with

307
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,079
minimal impact to your plants reduce the

308
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,760
growth of your plant and have it pick

309
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:21,359
right back up as soon as you get it

310
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:22,720
transplanted so that is basically what

311
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,519
we are what we're going to be talking

312
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,720
about today are some of the experiences

313
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:32,959
that I have had adjusting those various

314
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,120
um inputs to have dramatically different

315
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,198
results in many of the plants that I've

316
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,639
grown out over the years you mentioned

317
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:41,599
having a slow down plant growth and it's

318
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:43,440
uh kind of laugh a little bit because I

319
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,360
actually released a whole video on how

320
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,600
to titled how to slow down plant growth

321
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,959
and that definitely raised some eyebrows

322
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,079
for sure but the thing was I was going

323
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,479
on vacation right and I didn't want to

324
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:57,559
come back and have the plants grown into

325
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,440
the light and so yeah there are things

326
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:01,119
that sometimes you do need to slow down

327
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,199
plant growth but uh that's definitely a

328
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,440
separate topic there okay so good

329
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:08,198
definitions on both of those things

330
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,720
let's get into to start we we'll break

331
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:11,399
down each individual thing you talked

332
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,199
about climate and then light intensity

333
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,679
and irrigation let's start with the

334
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:18,519
climate and I think one of the things

335
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:21,319
that come to mind is the temperature day

336
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,198
temps versus night temps so can you kind

337
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,600
of break it down for us like what are

338
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:28,039
you typically aiming for for day temps

339
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,159
what do you aim for for night temps what

340
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:34,120
impact the has on plant growth so on and

341
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:36,000
so forth absolutely so um this might be

342
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,120
a little controversial

343
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,078
but I kind of like high high

344
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:47,198
temperatures um when I am in veg when my

345
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:49,879
plants are I would say 3 weeks old all

346
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:52,838
the way through up until week six of

347
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:55,078
flower I like high temperatures I am

348
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,639
completely fine with my tense tense

349
00:14:55,078 --> 00:15:03,039
reaching 90°

350
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:06,320
92° as long as you have adequate

351
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:08,679
humidity for the uh for the phase of

352
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,519
growth that your plant is in adequate

353
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:17,239
air exchange and air flow so I have I

354
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:21,399
have a 4x2 living soil bed in a 4x2 tent

355
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,639
and um I often have troubles keeping the

356
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,759
uh the temperatures down in that tent

357
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:29,680
I've had issues with with heat stress

358
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:32,440
there is a a healthy amount of stress I

359
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,838
think is acceptable and actually needed

360
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,319
in every plant's life I think to bring

361
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,360
out the best Expressions because let's

362
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:40,799
face it we're we're trying to this is

363
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,318
biomimicry when we're talking about

364
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,000
growing indoors if you look

365
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:47,719
outdoors in the in the in the summertime

366
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,720
you go outside to if you're growing an

367
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:55,759
outdoor plant and it is 95°

368
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,920
outside your plant is praying why is

369
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:02,399
that and your hum you know the humidity

370
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:05,439
might be 40 40 % out there um I think we

371
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,879
we try we try to attain these these

372
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,880
perfect temperatures and humidities and

373
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:12,399
VPD is obviously something a lot of

374
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:16,318
people pay a lot of attention to I pay

375
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,879
attention to it but I have a a very go

376
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:22,198
with the flow type of approach where I

377
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:26,278
just go into my my garage and I react to

378
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:29,198
how my plants look and um there are

379
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:31,078
there are things that um so so we talk

380
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,639
about high temperatures later in flow I

381
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:34,958
want to be very very careful because

382
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,600
like you said you have newer Growers you

383
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,879
have to have adequate air flow in air

384
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,560
exchange if you are going to have higher

385
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:46,198
temp uh higher humidity levels I am fine

386
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:48,799
if it's 90 90° and 70% humidity week six

387
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:51,599
flow my plants are loving it at that

388
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,399
point um so you just want to you just

389
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,440
have to keep in keep in mind you have to

390
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:59,120
keep that ratio uh ratio appropriate and

391
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,920
making sure that if you're if you have

392
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,560
leaves overlapping each other you're not

393
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,879
getting moisture pockets and things like

394
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,558
that so there are things that you just

395
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:09,400
have to be aware of but um you know

396
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:10,519
higher temperatures you're going to get

397
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,759
you're you're you're going to get higher

398
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:15,798
yields and your plants are going to grow

399
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:17,558
more vigorously um especially in veg uh

400
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:18,918
you you have nice high temperatures nice

401
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:23,599
high humidities your plants are going to

402
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:25,559
grow very rapidly um so like I said I I

403
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,599
tell people all the time when they ask

404
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:30,200
me questions I say it really depends

405
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,639
because there is no one- siiz fits-all

406
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,080
solution to this and uh or when it comes

407
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,759
to advice because everybody has

408
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,199
different growing parameters and

409
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,038
different mediums and inputs and things

410
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,640
like that so I I try to speak in

411
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:44,919
generalities and and add caveats as much

412
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,720
as possible yeah I try to do the same

413
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,120
thing because you know over the years

414
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,679
people have complained because uh you

415
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,599
know like oh that's not the right

416
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,000
temperature that's you can do this

417
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:56,599
temperature instead and it's like yeah

418
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,960
you can you can do 90° Fahrenheit like

419
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:01,599
Chris is doing right or you could go

420
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,360
down and do 75° right so it's like

421
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,759
you're still going to get to harvest but

422
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:12,399
yeah I'm looking at the vpg chart right

423
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:14,400
now 90° in flow it calls for 64 to 68% R

424
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,159
so it's pretty high higher than a lot of

425
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,759
people would go in the flower stage cuz

426
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,840
they don't want to do that humidity but

427
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,038
don't want to risk mold I should say but

428
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,720
uh you can totally get away with it

429
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:27,640
especially if you have that air flow now

430
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,600
I'm usually running about 82° fah and

431
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,080
then I try to drop at after week five

432
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,519
six of flour I'm trying to drop it down

433
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:37,599
a little bit to try to conserve some of

434
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:40,519
those tpin right the flavonoids yes 100%

435
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:45,439
and actually I have a a really perfect

436
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:48,480
example of that we try to work on uh our

437
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,440
weakest variable right so I grow in a

438
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,480
garage and I'm at the mercy of the

439
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,960
outside temperatures and often times the

440
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,960
the hard the things that we can't

441
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,558
control are are are the hardest things

442
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,400
and uh it's it's not always about the

443
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,558
your environment inside your tent that's

444
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,798
important it's a lot of times what your

445
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:11,879
outside is that's driving those in

446
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:14,200
inside conditions so um it is not ideal

447
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,720
I do want to be very very clear to have

448
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,400
90 Dee temperatures in week six of flour

449
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,600
that is not ideal uh and as you drop

450
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,759
your temperatures there are other things

451
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:27,599
that you're going to see happen tpine

452
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:29,759
preservation is incredibly important um

453
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,879
you're going to see uh your anth thein

454
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,279
is going if it's if it's present in gen

455
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,000
in the genetics your PL your plants are

456
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:38,200
going to get you know burgundy and

457
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,839
purples um and you're going to get that

458
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:44,360
beautiful fall Fade with the cooler

459
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:48,359
temperatures um but uh I actually grew

460
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:52,279
out a clone two clones of Lumpy's apple

461
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:54,399
fritter uh lumpy cut of apple fritter um

462
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:56,240
and I wanted to do I do a lot of side

463
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,960
by-side testing I think there is a

464
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,279
tremendous amount of value in doing

465
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:07,440
testing for a home grower um because

466
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:10,720
it's low risk and by failing You observe

467
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,679
what caused it to fail and I feel you

468
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,159
learn from those failures so it is an

469
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:18,679
important part of the the growing

470
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:22,520
process is that failure um but then also

471
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:25,759
sometimes you have happy uh accidents

472
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:28,038
and and really interesting things happen

473
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:31,359
uh when you least expect it so I grew

474
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:36,119
out this uh this apple fritter uh Earth

475
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:39,319
boxes for both um and I grew one under

476
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:41,719
uh about 600 par which is typically the

477
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:43,359
range that I prefer for my flowering

478
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,079
plants 600 to

479
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,359
900 uh is kind of I I don't push my

480
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,519
plants very hard because I don't

481
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:53,240
supplement

482
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:56,720
CO2 um so at the lower intensities I

483
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:59,519
observed uh the plant's morphology was

484
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,960
very different the uh the flowers were

485
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,960
larger they were um they were firm but

486
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,440
they were not dense and they had a lot

487
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,880
more Tricom coverage versus the ones

488
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:14,880
that I grew in another tent at around

489
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:17,400
1100 uh par and uh all the same inputs

490
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,520
uh but the buds were smaller they were

491
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,798
much more dense um less tricomes and the

492
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:26,639
flavor was completely different

493
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:29,119
completely different um and I even grew

494
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,600
it out a third time with even less light

495
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:35,879
in a in a 2X two tent and I got where I

496
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:38,719
got gas the first time I got grape the

497
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:42,400
the the next time just wildly different

498
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:47,038
all from the same clone just by altering

499
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:49,480
light intensities so now you can look at

500
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:52,839
let's experiment with

501
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,960
UVB uh I mean there's been studies

502
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:59,519
showing that there's significant tpine

503
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:04,038
production increase with uh with UVB in

504
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:05,839
small amounts uh in the day or using red

505
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:08,440
light uh when you when you put your

506
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:11,038
plants to sleep to help ease them into

507
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,960
into sleep uh there are all all sorts of

508
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,879
really cool things that we could do with

509
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,000
uh light intensity and and U and color

510
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:21,080
frequencies and things like that to

511
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,679
impact um our our end result as well

512
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:26,319
that a really good example of how

513
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,038
different climates will yield different

514
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:29,960
results right you mentioned the two

515
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:32,038
different clones you had and different

516
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,200
environments and two completely

517
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:37,000
different outcomes so great example of

518
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,600
that one how about day length now that's

519
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,599
something that people talk about when it

520
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:43,199
comes to crop steering talk to us about

521
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:46,240
that I've done a few things when we're

522
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,360
talking about um indoor

523
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,839
controls uh you know I I do have uh AC

524
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:54,678
Infinity lights that have the the the

525
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:57,038
daylight uh the sunrise sunset feature

526
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:59,200
I've experimented with that I wouldn't

527
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,759
say that I've done it I've gone done any

528
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,480
like true side by-side comparisons with

529
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:08,000
that by any means but um what I I did

530
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:12,360
notice on the few times that I have kind

531
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:17,720
of stepped my plants down vers uh so

532
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:19,119
going from 186 to 14 hours on versus

533
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,079
going straight to

534
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:25,439
1212 um I have found a gentler

535
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:27,798
transition you can make the argument

536
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,120
that the plant doesn't care and if you

537
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:31,599
flip it to 12 it's going to adjust and

538
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:34,519
you're just going to have more time

539
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:39,000
where it's going to be able to produce

540
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:42,200
at at a you know our generative phase

541
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,400
but um like I said I've I've tried I've

542
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,360
tried it numerous times it's some I

543
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,080
think

544
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:50,678
there's we may never be able to quantify

545
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:53,519
it but at the very least you'll save

546
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,919
energy and that's not a bad thing but

547
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:58,319
when we're when we're talking about

548
00:23:54,919 --> 00:24:01,799
light duration we have to talk about DLI

549
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:04,759
um um and for anybody who is listening

550
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:07,400
that um hasn't measured their their

551
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:09,599
light intensity um not saying you have

552
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,559
to go buy an expensive meter they have

553
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:14,439
uh very effective meters um as apps on

554
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:16,158
your phone and they have little

555
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,679
attachments you can get on your phone

556
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,960
and they get really really close to some

557
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:24,600
of the higher quality um light meters

558
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,919
out there but it is super important to

559
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:28,480
um have your Baseline to know where your

560
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:31,720
plants are and how much light they're

561
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:35,519
getting because when you drop your your

562
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:38,759
lights from 18 hours to uh of light to

563
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:40,639
12 hours of light your plants uh think

564
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,278
of it as a battery your battery is not

565
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,399
going to fully charge if you keep your

566
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:48,119
light uh intensity at the same uh at the

567
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:51,398
same rate um at that at that lower

568
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:54,000
duration so um you have to scale it

569
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:57,079
appropriately so uh definitely start

570
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,880
measuring par uh ppfd if you if you are

571
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:02,240
not um because I I think that is one of

572
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,520
the evolutions of the hom grower is kind

573
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,399
of like the next step to to Really um

574
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,440
honing in your grow and having full

575
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:14,199
control uh or better control I should

576
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:16,919
say of uh of your outcomes so um yeah I

577
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,880
I I would say uh th those are probably

578
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:23,240
the things that that I've I've

579
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,159
personally experimented with and and I'm

580
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,200
currently doing is just kind of stepping

581
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:28,320
down the light but again it's I don't

582
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,080
know if it's something I can necess

583
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:34,519
necessarily say definitively like yes

584
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:36,759
this is making a positive or negative

585
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:38,480
impact one way or the other got it and

586
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:41,278
you mentioned the par range that you

587
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,679
typically aim for 600 to 900 ppfd and

588
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:45,359
flowering I usually do the same range

589
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,240
there I think it's a good General range

590
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:50,759
but like you mentioned DLI needs to be

591
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,960
factored into it I have a DLI calculator

592
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:56,278
up right now and this pretty easy to use

593
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,360
if you Google it I'm not sure if folks

594
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:00,880
in listening in have done this before

595
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:04,000
but you just put in your ppfd so I put

596
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,039
900 and then time hours that would be

597
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,359
how long the lights are on for 12 hours

598
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,359
that's a 38.888421100000

599
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:31,278
and that's one thing that we kind of I

600
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,880
gu skipped over a little bit when we

601
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,119
were talking about climate do you have

602
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,799
anything to add about CO2 like are you

603
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,759
supplementing CO2 is there certain ppms

604
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:40,918
that you're aiming for how does that

605
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:44,359
factor into crop

606
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:46,278
steering so um that is actually one area

607
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:50,158
that I haven't uh that I haven't gotten

608
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:53,159
into because I have I've taken into

609
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:56,159
account the opinions of Growers that I

610
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:58,399
know that have supplemented CO2 um and

611
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,278
measured it uh as well as people people

612
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:02,519
that I really respect in the industry

613
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:05,278
that uh that supplement CO2 and I think

614
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:07,639
for my style of growing it is it I I

615
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:10,679
determined it to be an unnecessary

616
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,720
expense because like I said I am not

617
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:16,000
pushing my my lights very hard I know

618
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,720
I'm leaving yield on the table I I I

619
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
definitely know that but as a hom grower

620
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:23,679
I'm okay with that because I really am

621
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,319
prioritizing the flavor um over over uh

622
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,720
the yield of course I like to have both

623
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,798
you know we love to have it all but but

624
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,480
um you know that that's just kind of uh

625
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:34,119
really depends on what your priorities

626
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,000
are as a grower and if you need to

627
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:39,158
monetize your medicinales then you know

628
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,960
and prioritize yield then you know

629
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:43,519
that's uh your prerogative and um you

630
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,200
know it's probably financially

631
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,519
beneficial too then it probably pay for

632
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,360
itself but uh yeah it's just it's just

633
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,798
not something that um really fits with

634
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:54,359
my growing style yet but it's not

635
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:56,000
something I am against testing in the in

636
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:58,199
the future if the opportunity presents

637
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,319
itself yeah I've experimented a little

638
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,360
little bit with CO2 in the past nothing

639
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,918
too crazy those mushroom bags and the

640
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:07,479
canisters which a lot of controversy

641
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:09,038
about those on whether or not they work

642
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,120
I have a monitor so I was able to see it

643
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:12,640
was elevated I'm no longer using them

644
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:15,839
you know just like you I'm a small home

645
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,440
grower I exhale CO2 and that's enough

646
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:19,119
for the the home I live in the plants

647
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,159
where I am but it is certainly worth

648
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:24,119
mentioning I know there's a study out of

649
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:26,840
Utah State University where they did PPM

650
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:30,359
levels of CO2 up to 1,400 and they saw

651
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:33,678
30% increasing and yield due to that so

652
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:35,519
it's definitely worth it to increase CO2

653
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,360
supplement CO2 if you are looking for

654
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,759
yield but not everybody's looking for

655
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:42,719
that and I'm not too sure how that if

656
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,839
adjusting the CO2 up and down would

657
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,759
affect the plant in some way like if

658
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:49,000
people use that in crop steering in

659
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:50,720
order to try to control the growth or or

660
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,519
whatever so I guess that's something

661
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,640
that uh going have to do some more

662
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:56,079
research and figure out yeah it's very

663
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,880
interesting because um I mean

664
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:00,199
essentially what you could be doing is

665
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,600
um you're stressing it it's there's

666
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,720
there's going to be a stress response

667
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:09,439
and it's not too dissimilar to the way

668
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:11,960
other plants are um are steered where

669
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,558
they will flip the light cycle between

670
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,880
uh generative and vegetative and um use

671
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:19,879
that to actually increase yield you

672
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,159
wouldn't do that obviously with with

673
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,000
medicinal herbs because they would they

674
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:28,159
would freak out and rev and you would

675
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,480
have all sorts of issues but um yeah

676
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,440
theoretically it's it's not too

677
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,759
dissimilar to that so we already dove

678
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,640
into light intensity a little bit uh you

679
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,759
touched upon sunrise and sunset but

680
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:41,000
there is one thing I want to add to that

681
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,919
so there was a study from Dr Bruce bugby

682
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,759
again coming out of US State University

683
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:47,759
where he tested sunrise sunset that

684
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:50,679
feature of gradually giving the plants

685
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,240
light up to full power versus just

686
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:54,679
blasting the plants full power when the

687
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,880
light cycle comes on and what they found

688
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:58,600
was that there was actually faster

689
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,000
growth when you just blast that light to

690
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:02,839
begin now when I had mentioned that in

691
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,679
videos in the past the podcast episodes

692
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:06,398
in the past you get people in the

693
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,080
comments are like okay so the growth

694
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:09,959
rate is better when you're blasting

695
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:12,558
light individually versus the sunrise

696
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,079
sunset but is there other triggers

697
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:16,678
within the plant that is happening

698
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:18,480
during that Sunrise Sunset and I think

699
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:20,360
that's an a question that isn't answered

700
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,480
yet so fig I'd throw that out there for

701
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:25,000
folks you know that's one thing that

702
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,200
when it comes to cultivation we don't

703
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,798
know everything yet scientists is still

704
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,440
uncovering things so some beginners

705
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:33,158
might be listening this and be like U

706
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,720
seems to be some conflicting information

707
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:36,640
yeah there's it's loaded with

708
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,120
conflicting information in this that's

709
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,440
the fun part is kind of diving through

710
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:41,319
and trying to figure out what works and

711
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,720
what doesn't experimentation on your own

712
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:46,000
and stuff like that but the discussion

713
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,960
should still kind of go on and yeah fig

714
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,480
I'd mention that even though we don't

715
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,679
have a clear-cut answer on uh on that

716
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:56,038
study yes absolutely experimentation man

717
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:58,080
like don't be afraid to just just try

718
00:30:56,038 --> 00:30:59,440
something you know like what's the word

719
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,319
that can happen you you might lose a

720
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,399
plant you know like but you might gain

721
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,119
invaluable Knowledge from that from that

722
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:10,079
failure too I think when you when you

723
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:13,038
could see something go go bad you you

724
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,638
can learn a lot from that you know so

725
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:17,480
yeah like just the troubleshooting

726
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:20,199
aspect of it and researching why things

727
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,000
are are starting to you know have a

728
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,038
certain reaction One Way or Another yeah

729
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,679
it's all very interesting but experiment

730
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:28,919
absolutely all right let's move on let's

731
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,440
dive into irrigation so this is a key

732
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:32,559
thing that is done while crop steering

733
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,919
like you mentioned in the beginning of

734
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:37,240
this episode we've got irrigation volume

735
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:39,559
we've got frequency and timing we got

736
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,759
dryback talk to us about irrigation I'll

737
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:44,720
kind of just give you the microphone

738
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:46,519
here and drop some knowledge on us sure

739
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:51,639
so as a

740
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:54,599
grower um new or experience watering is

741
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:57,038
I think the hardest part to get down and

742
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:58,959
it's especially important uh and I will

743
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,919
speak to a lot of these things through

744
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,399
the lens of living soil because that is

745
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,559
what I have the most experience with but

746
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:08,278
I think that it's there's also wider

747
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:11,158
applicability with this as well

748
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:13,159
generally speaking um there are there

749
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:15,840
are things that we could do when it

750
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:19,840
comes to how much we are watering and

751
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:23,558
how uh frequently we are watering to

752
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:26,879
drive uh you know growth of our plants

753
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:28,480
or stunt it um more more frequently I

754
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,320
think people suffer from

755
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,599
um I think there is a a common

756
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:38,439
misunderstanding of when we're watering

757
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:41,439
what is what is overwatering it is not a

758
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:43,880
thorough saturation of your soil that is

759
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,320
causing the overwatering it is the

760
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,559
thorough saturation and the constant

761
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,839
saturation is the frequency that is

762
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:54,798
becoming the issue and your plants don't

763
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:58,480
have a way to breathe so um dryb backs

764
00:32:54,798 --> 00:33:01,000
are incredibly important and that's why

765
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,399
in living soil when we as living soil

766
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,159
Growers have to we can't let things get

767
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:08,518
too dry obviously we have to maintain

768
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,080
this this perfect balance I think for us

769
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:14,319
it's very important to have uh some sort

770
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:17,439
of a a way to measure so getting some

771
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:20,519
sort of a meter to to to measure your

772
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,080
moisture is I think very important um

773
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:24,839
whether you're me measuring your

774
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:27,000
moisture at the bottom or the top uh

775
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:28,439
doesn't really matter as much because

776
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,319
the way that I see

777
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:34,240
if you're able to learn the patterns of

778
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:36,439
when your water your plant needs water

779
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,480
and when you uh when your plant needs to

780
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,480
dry back you'll you'll be able to you

781
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,839
know those percentages you know the Ean

782
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,399
flow that's the most important thing to

783
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:50,759
do and we can I mean we could talk hours

784
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:54,479
on on watering practices um but the dry

785
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:57,879
back in flow so again biomimicry blatant

786
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,558
flour if you're Outdoors growing less

787
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,080
less rain you go your you the the dog

788
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:05,398
days of summer it's drought-like

789
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,960
conditions right your plants are um

790
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:09,239
they're they're going into a

791
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:13,559
preservation mode where they're not

792
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:15,559
going to grow as rapidly um and when you

793
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:18,000
are in an indoor environment you want to

794
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:19,838
do this a similar type of thing they're

795
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,280
not going to be drinking as much later

796
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:27,279
in flour so watering less and less

797
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:29,040
frequently um again late in the late

798
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,359
stages of of flower is what you're going

799
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:34,199
to want because I think you see if you

800
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:36,759
if you look in a lot of Growers Gardens

801
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:39,519
and you see a lot of the leaves that are

802
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,320
kind of you they got the curve generally

803
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:44,519
speaking that happen from overwatering

804
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,559
and a lot of times it happens late in

805
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:48,039
flour because you're pumping it with

806
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:49,559
water you want to give it all those good

807
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:52,320
nutrients that you're giving all those

808
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:55,239
those supplementation with your ferments

809
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,919
and and and other things like that you

810
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:59,479
need to start backing that stuff off

811
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:01,799
starting around week week six or so

812
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,320
depending on the cultivar again it all

813
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,480
depends if you're growing a sativa

814
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,559
that's a 22 weer you don't need to back

815
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,519
off just yet but if you know if you're

816
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:11,960
growing a hybrid Inda something that's

817
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,679
like a you know eight or nine weer I

818
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,159
would say week six is around the time

819
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,239
you're going to want to start pulling

820
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:20,440
that stuff back because your plants

821
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:23,399
going to drink less and uh you you you

822
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:26,960
don't want to get to a point where you

823
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:29,720
drown your plant and you do stunt your

824
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,800
uh your flower growth uh because I have

825
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:35,118
I have done that numerous times I'm I'm

826
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:38,280
constantly struggling with finding the

827
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,800
the right balance for watering it's uh

828
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,359
because I I grow in a bunch of different

829
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,960
things I grow in a living soil bed I

830
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:47,559
have Earth boxes and I have autopots and

831
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:52,440
they all have nuances to their watering

832
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:55,599
practices so um the amount and frequency

833
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:59,200
very important another thing that I have

834
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:03,079
found very satisfying in of late having

835
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:05,480
a friend that's local that um has been a

836
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:09,560
uh that miles from fermented plant

837
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:11,519
exract was uh a mentor too he's uh he

838
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:13,880
has his own ferment company so I have

839
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:17,358
access to a lot of different types of

840
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:20,480
ferments and I have tried so many

841
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:22,838
different types and what I have found is

842
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:27,280
that there are a couple in particular

843
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:32,239
that do an amazing job of being like an

844
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:34,839
all purpose F ferment because um the the

845
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:37,559
typical uh I

846
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:40,400
guess process with fermentation is

847
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:42,759
you're trying to encapsulate a moment of

848
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,559
time of whatever you're fermenting what

849
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,520
I mean by that if it's um hemp leaves

850
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:51,559
for instance that's coming from the the

851
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:53,519
vegetative phase of of a plant your

852
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:56,159
fermenting that you are going to be

853
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:59,519
getting more of the nutrition and things

854
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,480
that are prevalent in that phase of the

855
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,280
of that

856
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,639
material's uh you know life cycle when

857
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,800
it was harvested conversely with flowers

858
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:12,118
or fruit things like that those are

859
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,599
going to have higher uh you know pot

860
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:16,280
like geared more towards your flowering

861
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,800
phase and they may have tra you know

862
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,960
smaller amounts of nutrition like

863
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,560
phosphorus and potassium um although we

864
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,079
don't use ferments really for for

865
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:25,880
nutrition it's just kind of an

866
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:29,079
unintended benefit of it being there um

867
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:33,880
but Peach and Willow

868
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:37,280
um I've tried confrey is is amazing for

869
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:41,358
uh for veg and pumpkin is awesome for

870
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:44,400
flour but I find Peach has given the

871
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:46,440
most robust flavor in all of the

872
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,440
different varieties that I have tried it

873
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:54,760
in and um I think Willow is kind of a

874
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:57,679
kind of a sleeper um I think um I don't

875
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:00,599
know that I I could speak to why

876
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:02,679
performs so well but um there were there

877
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:05,039
were visual differences in my plant's

878
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:07,199
Health when I was using the willow uh

879
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:10,719
again I I I do it when I when I compare

880
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:13,480
clones I I run clones so I can do a true

881
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:15,959
AB test uh so when I when I say these

882
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,960
things it's not me testing these

883
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,920
theories on multiple cultivars or even

884
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,000
multiple phenotypes U they're usually

885
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,880
you know they're they're from clone so

886
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,559
um it's you could you could definitely

887
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,119
see a market difference between the

888
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:34,880
different types of fermentation so for

889
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:38,200
people that haven't experimented with

890
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,039
ferments I highly recommend ferments as

891
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:42,639
uh as something that you could start

892
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:46,880
incorporating into your watering regimen

893
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:48,598
very safely um and uh you will see a a

894
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,079
visual difference in your plants in a

895
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:52,559
very very short amount of time uh

896
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,079
ferments are awesome definitely where

897
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,078
it's at I'm going to have to check out

898
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,680
your buddy's website there and probably

899
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,359
pick something up try out going back to

900
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:02,440
irrigation real quick one of the things

901
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:04,559
you touched upon was moisture meters I

902
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,358
think that's a game Cher for a lot of

903
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,838
folks here I think that's one of the

904
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:11,838
struggles of beginner Growers is dialing

905
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:14,039
and watering medium being too wet or too

906
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:16,279
dry now sometimes it's good with the dry

907
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:18,639
backs right it does help the plant but

908
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,960
if it's unintentional well then it's not

909
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,039
good and I'm waiting for AC Infinity to

910
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,039
release the moisture meter if you're

911
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:26,119
listening to AC Infinity release one

912
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:28,800
because that's going to be huge and send

913
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:30,920
me 12 because I'll them and I will use

914
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,000
them a lot of people are using them I

915
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,280
know there's the Eco wit one blue matat

916
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,519
I have a blue matat one right now the

917
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,200
blue mat moisture meter very expensive

918
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:40,679
though it's like 85 bucks for just one

919
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:43,039
meter so hopefully it's more affordable

920
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:45,239
options on the future but it'd be really

921
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:46,599
really cool to be able to just look at

922
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:48,318
your cell phone and see what the

923
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:50,440
different moisture levels are and then

924
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:51,559
get alerts when you need to water I

925
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,639
think that would be really really cool

926
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:58,000
in the future that's on my My Hope list

927
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:59,920
yes yes yeah mine too I have a couple on

928
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,159
my short list for AC

929
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,720
Infinity but dryb backs one more thing I

930
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:05,960
want to dive a little bit deeper into

931
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:07,838
because we have folks who are doing this

932
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,039
using synthetic bottle nutrients and

933
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,078
that's a little bit easier than doing

934
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:14,079
with Organics Organics you can kind of

935
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:16,599
run into issues if you are doing these

936
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:19,839
dry backs I think it's commonly known

937
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:22,039
now that with Organics using organic

938
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:23,599
inputs you're relying on the microbes to

939
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:25,039
actually break down those inputs and

940
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,960
turn them into usable nutrients for the

941
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,838
plant and if there's no moisture in the

942
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,720
medium or if it's too dry those microbes

943
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:33,920
actually kind die either die off or go

944
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:35,159
dormant and then you need to obviously

945
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,800
res saturate the medium in order to kind

946
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:39,799
of get that thing going again so if

947
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,000
you're doing crop steering and using

948
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,280
organic inputs how would you go about

949
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,838
doing dryb backs so I'm actually going

950
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:51,720
to use um the autopots as a as an

951
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:53,838
example because um the autopot is and

952
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:56,039
actually this could be applicable to

953
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:57,358
basically any sub irrigated system but

954
00:40:56,039 --> 00:41:00,400
I'm going to I'm going to speak

955
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:02,440
specifically to the auto pots um so in a

956
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,519
living soil setup I'm running the xxl's

957
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:09,960
which are 13 gallons these are very tall

958
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:11,920
pots they Wick very well um however uh

959
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,199
you will not be able to Wick all the way

960
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,720
to the top so if you are top dressing

961
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:22,239
your amendments then you are going to

962
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:24,480
have to alternate top watering when uh

963
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:27,279
when you were um to make sure that we're

964
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,519
breaking down those amendments so

965
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,200
perfect example was today I actually

966
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:34,759
went in and shut off my reservoir

967
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:37,598
yesterday to make sure that the

968
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:41,240
everything was starting to dry back so

969
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:45,079
as the Water started to uh to you know

970
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:47,759
go down um I have an opportunity then to

971
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:52,280
top dress and water from the top and I

972
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:54,960
will do this alternating probably every

973
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:58,480
every week or so um just to make sure

974
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:01,639
that the the top never gets um too dry

975
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,039
but also making sure that um you know

976
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:06,519
I'm able to start breaking down the

977
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:08,440
things that I'm adding in because just

978
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:10,239
by me throwing it in there even working

979
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,760
it in the soil it is not going to be

980
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:15,799
efficient it really um or or adequate

981
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:18,560
rather it it really does need to um to

982
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,400
have that uh that top watering part as

983
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:24,799
as part of it um

984
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:26,519
so I would say the dry backs are are

985
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,200
immensely important because you you

986
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:31,960
don't want to have half of your your pot

987
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:33,799
highly saturated because you had your

988
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:37,559
Reservoir going and then you start top

989
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:40,720
watering as well your plants will will

990
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:44,480
hate you for it um and it will take a

991
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:47,759
while for it to recover um and depending

992
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,838
on how far along you are in flour it may

993
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:54,240
not fully recover um you know and it

994
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:58,159
might impact your your yield so um I

995
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:59,639
think just being Ultra aware of um you

996
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:02,078
know how much water you're putting in in

997
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:04,558
the frequency um and make sure that you

998
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,599
know you do have that that dryback uh

999
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,000
especially if you're doing a sub

1000
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,838
irrigated system uh it's really an

1001
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,639
important part of the process good tips

1002
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:15,358
so we talked about climate light

1003
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:17,838
intensity and irrigation there's some

1004
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:19,400
other things that people do when they do

1005
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:20,639
crop steering which kind of doesn't

1006
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,920
really fall in the categories I guess

1007
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:25,838
this next one probably could which is EC

1008
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:28,318
or PPM I know some folks will actually

1009
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:30,480
adjust the EC or PPM specifically when

1010
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:32,279
using like bottled synthetic nutrients

1011
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,800
talking Organics with the inputs a lot

1012
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,319
of people aren't even looking at the EC

1013
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,119
or the PPM right do you have anything to

1014
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:42,199
kind of talk to us about when it comes

1015
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:44,720
to EC or PPM and crop steering so um I

1016
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:48,759
have an expensive EC meter I stopped

1017
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:51,759
using it about 3 years ago uh I was uh I

1018
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:56,400
I actually I did start in soil

1019
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:58,720
uh regular organic soil was not organic

1020
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,639
um and and did go to Coco for a while

1021
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:02,838
and and did the synthetic nutrients for

1022
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:05,719
a while but um

1023
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:09,078
definitely what I was spending far too

1024
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:11,279
much time in my garage mixing water and

1025
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:14,960
I was away from my family for far too

1026
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:17,720
long um so when I learned of living soil

1027
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:20,519
and one of the highlights being hey you

1028
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:23,279
don't need to measure things as much and

1029
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:25,119
you don't need to pH your water it's

1030
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,839
important to pay attention to your pH I

1031
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,760
mean especially if you're adding things

1032
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:30,279
like

1033
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,800
you know um highly acidic things or

1034
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:35,079
highly Alkaline Things you definitely

1035
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:38,880
want to be aware of it but I don't

1036
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:41,200
measure it uh and um I I also when

1037
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,838
you're when you're working with Organic

1038
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:44,480
um inputs I I found at least the

1039
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:47,159
products that I have worked with They

1040
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,719
Don't Really spike your EC so even

1041
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:52,199
though I'm adding you know scoops of you

1042
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:55,480
know Green aminos and you know build the

1043
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:58,000
FL uh build the bloom and um you know

1044
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:01,280
maybe some coconut and and other things

1045
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,079
my EC is staying relatively low I am

1046
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:07,440
also using an RO water system out of out

1047
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,519
of necessity which which really does um

1048
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,119
help in my situation I have well water

1049
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:13,000
on my property I know that there are

1050
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:18,720
many people that have this situation as

1051
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:24,039
well my PPM uh of my water and my um my

1052
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:27,239
pH naturally is like a 9 pH and was like

1053
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:29,400
1,000 PPM it was it was crazy high crazy

1054
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:30,959
high it's unusable because as soon as I

1055
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,559
started adding stuff it would it would

1056
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,318
put me over 2,000 it was you know it was

1057
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:38,480
the danger zone at that point so I got

1058
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:40,400
an RO system just uh not a whole house

1059
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:44,280
it's just under my sink in the kitchen I

1060
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:47,519
fill up 5 gallon uh uh buckets you know

1061
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:50,960
or the the five gallon um jugs I should

1062
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:52,519
say from the grocery store um and uh I

1063
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,519
have three of those and I have them

1064
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:57,400
sitting out in my in my garage they kind

1065
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:58,800
of get uh to room temperature because

1066
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,160
water temperature is also important you

1067
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,280
don't want to put super cold water in

1068
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:03,838
there so it gets to room temperature uh

1069
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:07,440
it's a little bit more tepid and then it

1070
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:11,000
also um any any types of it also levels

1071
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,559
the pH um as it sits out it kind of

1072
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,480
stabilizes right at around seven so at

1073
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:19,640
that point um for me personally EC is

1074
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:22,000
just not much of a concern understood

1075
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:23,838
another thing that's lumped into crop

1076
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,318
steering but isn't talked about as often

1077
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:28,078
I'd say is defoliation and plant

1078
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:29,800
training so defoliation we're really

1079
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,280
talking about like pruning for example

1080
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,640
pruning the plant or plant training you

1081
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,720
know the topping fimming low stress

1082
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:38,960
training those things are resulting in

1083
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:41,279
the plant having internal changes right

1084
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,159
stress response redistribution of

1085
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,920
hormones so on and so forth can you talk

1086
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:47,279
to us about those things pruning and

1087
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,599
training and and crop steering

1088
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,599
absolutely um so again it all really

1089
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,800
depends on what your goals are for me

1090
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:56,480
personally as a photographer my my

1091
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,318
primary objective for the genetics that

1092
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,000
I run is to maintain a beautiful main

1093
00:46:59,318 --> 00:47:04,239
Cola so I can have something that is the

1094
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,838
most photogenic thing

1095
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:09,519
possible I also have again I can't

1096
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:12,759
necessarily back this up because I

1097
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:15,358
haven't done side by side tests yet like

1098
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:17,200
expansive um experimentation but in the

1099
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,000
limited experiments that I have done

1100
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:21,679
when it came to plants that I have

1101
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,760
topped versus ones that I haven't I've

1102
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:26,358
actually found my yield to be better on

1103
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,599
the plants that I don't top and when

1104
00:47:26,358 --> 00:47:29,960
people see my plants they are actually

1105
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:32,720
surprised when they find out that I

1106
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:36,159
don't top because they I'm able to

1107
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:39,078
achieve a very even canopy and I do that

1108
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:41,719
by sometimes I'll bend over the the top

1109
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:43,519
cola if I am running if I know that a

1110
00:47:41,719 --> 00:47:47,480
strain is going or a cultivar is going

1111
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:49,159
to stretch on me or if I'm already in a

1112
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:52,719
situation where I know height is going

1113
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:56,239
to be an issue I will very gently train

1114
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:58,078
over that that uh your apical marem and

1115
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,159
your other branches are going to grow up

1116
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,559
and you're going to have a nice even

1117
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:04,078
canopy you're going to uh accomplish the

1118
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:07,559
same thing that you would with with um

1119
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:10,240
topping I really do believe that the

1120
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:12,359
yield is better when you don't top I

1121
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:15,358
find that my buds are bigger and more

1122
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:18,279
full when I don't top when I top I get

1123
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:20,078
uh and the perfect example was the trop

1124
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,960
Cherry number eight from Relentless

1125
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:26,079
genetics that I grew I grew a this was

1126
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:29,480
their cut I know what the cut looks like

1127
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:32,519
when uh when it is not topped I topped

1128
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:35,280
it and got a bunch of smaller beautiful

1129
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:37,599
buds but they were dramatically smaller

1130
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:41,000
they didn't fill in quite as much they

1131
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:43,559
were spaced out and again I can't say

1132
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:47,039
definitively it was because I didn't top

1133
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:50,440
or did top but I have found in you know

1134
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:53,000
my limited experience that not topping

1135
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:58,159
um definitely does help with with uh

1136
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:01,199
with the yield but I will also use uh uh

1137
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:03,558
monster cropping I I I I love going in

1138
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:06,239
or you know super cropping I'm pretty

1139
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:08,400
aggressive with it you know depending if

1140
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:10,679
it's early on and flower even if I crack

1141
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,200
off one eh you know Only the Strong

1142
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:15,000
Survive you can move on um but you can

1143
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:16,558
also you could tape them too and and

1144
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,199
they'll they'll be perfectly fine as

1145
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:21,720
well um so when you get uh when you do

1146
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:24,039
the the super cropping when you're

1147
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:27,838
taking and you're bending an aggressive

1148
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:30,480
45° angle um your plant is going to

1149
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:32,239
readjust to that over time and grow up

1150
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,440
into the light but it's going to form

1151
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:36,959
this really fat knuckle right at that

1152
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:40,358
point where you bent it over and it's

1153
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:44,159
going to improve your um nutrient uh

1154
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:47,199
like your your Highway basically things

1155
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:50,399
are going to be uptake uptaken quicker

1156
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:52,679
uh from again from my experience so uh

1157
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,559
that's a that's another uh great way to

1158
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:57,279
not just manage uh manage your canopy's

1159
00:49:55,559 --> 00:50:01,359
height in an emergency

1160
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:03,160
but uh to also improve your yields um

1161
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:06,039
but then also I think uh there are

1162
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:09,480
things that we could do to um to

1163
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:12,159
strengthen our stems um because early on

1164
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:15,358
in veg uh being a home a house plant

1165
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:19,679
grower uh I know the importance of

1166
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:22,039
having wind and uh when you have like

1167
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:24,519
climbing climbing house plants uh they

1168
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:27,440
need support plants are not too

1169
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:29,960
dissimilar in that where you are going

1170
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,920
to have to have um a gentle breeze on

1171
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:35,318
them when they're young so that your

1172
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:37,119
stems uh start to grow more rigid and

1173
00:50:35,318 --> 00:50:39,920
stronger and then as the plant gets

1174
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,798
older and those those stems have

1175
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,960
developed uh you know they're they're

1176
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:46,199
much stronger you're preparing for

1177
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,559
larger fruits so our buds that's that's

1178
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:52,000
what we're trying to get those those

1179
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:54,480
bigger buds so uh making sure that um we

1180
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,719
if we're if we're not adding poles or

1181
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:00,119
some sort of a a support mechanism

1182
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:03,759
um you know early on make sure that you

1183
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:05,599
have um have a gentle gentle breeze on

1184
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,799
your on your plants at all time to make

1185
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,519
sure that they're they're going to grow

1186
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:12,880
up strong to support those buds getting

1187
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:15,119
deeper into wind or air flow I think

1188
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,880
that's a good transition here is some

1189
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:19,640
people are actually using that and and

1190
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,720
trying to stress the plants to get a

1191
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:24,358
better result now I'll tell you one

1192
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:27,000
quick story is I had a tent full of

1193
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:29,960
plants and the plant that was right next

1194
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,559
to the fan was much frostier than some

1195
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,400
of the plants that were away from the

1196
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:36,680
fan so yep I think of potential

1197
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,079
windstress was helping to trigger some

1198
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:41,639
of that secondary metabolite production

1199
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:45,039
but uh I can't find a whole lot of info

1200
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:47,480
online about kind of wind stress or air

1201
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:49,039
flow and how that can actually benefit

1202
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,920
the plant do you have any background any

1203
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:53,558
information on that that kind of fill

1204
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:56,720
his in on i' I've experienced the exact

1205
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:58,280
same thing Chris uh so um I I'm actually

1206
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:00,078
experiencing it right now with a pure

1207
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:03,160
Michigan that I'm running I just because

1208
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:05,720
I'm in a in a very small 10 I you know

1209
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:08,798
three plants running in a 4X two um the

1210
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:11,199
the fan is right up against it and those

1211
00:52:08,798 --> 00:52:12,838
buds are the frostiest I I'll actually

1212
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:14,960
I'll I'll upload a video later just to

1213
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:16,599
show it because um I think that there is

1214
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,358
something again we may not be able to

1215
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:23,160
quantify it just yet we may never be

1216
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:26,598
able to but we know right we we see it

1217
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:29,239
ourselves and um I know that we are all

1218
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:31,440
trying to have like this image of

1219
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:32,879
perfection like we want to have all the

1220
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,599
leaves are beautiful they're all

1221
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,318
colorful they're all praying all the

1222
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:39,280
time and the reality is is by the end of

1223
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:41,599
our grow they look Haggard and beaten

1224
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,319
and weathered and they're like good God

1225
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,240
put me to death we just have to keep in

1226
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:49,318
mind we are not growing leaves we are

1227
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:51,358
growing flowers and the leaves are are

1228
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:53,838
there to be an indicator of plant Health

1229
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:56,199
they could be something that can show

1230
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:58,159
you uh that there there might be an

1231
00:52:56,199 --> 00:53:00,558
issue that you need to address there

1232
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:02,639
obviously our solar panels and and they

1233
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:06,119
provide transpiration and all of these

1234
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:08,639
but um we are not growing leaves um we

1235
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:10,920
we're growing flowers so don't be too

1236
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:13,318
discouraged if uh if your leaves aren't

1237
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,838
perfect um if you get the wind burn or

1238
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:17,039
or you know you get some curling from

1239
00:53:14,838 --> 00:53:19,039
overwatering or anything like that you

1240
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:21,440
know learn from what may have caused it

1241
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:24,719
but also know that you may have had an

1242
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:26,720
unintended benefit from that with that

1243
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:29,279
stress response and we may never know

1244
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:31,919
great Point well we are coming up to the

1245
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,319
hour mark here let's wrap things up now

1246
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,559
