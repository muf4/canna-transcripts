experiences into growing my own uh

89
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,039
medicine so I mean I I did I did work on

90
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,239
golf courses for many years I did

91
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,120
irrigation I did mechanics I did I was a

92
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,959
super you know assistant superintendent

93
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,360
so I I I I really liked the growing

94
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,799
season at a golf course you know you

95
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,200
would come out and it's like like

96
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:27,519
growing plants you'd have a start in the

97
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:30,039
you know in the spring you'd come out of

98
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,879
a harsh winter you'd have to like B the

99
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:34,039
course back you know Brown landscape and

100
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,359
then you know middle of summer

101
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:39,359
everything's vibrant and green and and

102
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,159
and such a lush you know player for the

103
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,799
thing so I I really feel like this is

104
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:46,519
where my my love for for growing came

105
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,319
from and and working on golf courses man

106
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,560
it's the same thing budget-based right

107
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,679
there's all even on big golf courses

108
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,000
nice expensive courses they're always

109
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,319
trying to cut your budget they're always

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
trying to get you to do it on the cheap

111
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:00,078
so you know macgyvering something and

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,039
and getting it to to to be that that

113
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,799
that sort of still get the job done and

114
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,239
do it on the cheap tip that's uh yeah

115
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,840
that's where it came from nice nice and

116
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,039
what would you say your overall grow

117
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,319
style is do you typically grow indoors

118
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:18,478
or Outdoors organic synthetic soil Coco

119
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:20,519
Hydro what's your style uh D all the

120
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,199
above I feel like changing it up from

121
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,199
time to time uh it gets me out of my

122
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:28,840
comfort zone and and it just leads to

123
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,800
like learning something new so right now

124
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,519
I grow both outdoor Dooors and indoors

125
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,720
and my wife my partner in crime she's

126
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:38,319
all she's she helps out so much and and

127
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,479
she's great um Outdoors I've done

128
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,319
synthetics before but I've got really

129
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:45,240
bad water here so I had to treat it and

130
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,519
I was really you know using my indoor

131
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,000
experience outdoors and it really was

132
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,359
expensive so I I've switched over and

133
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,918
now I'm doing organic outside it's great

134
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,199
I do a PR miix worm casting mix Gaia

135
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:01,918
green and man the cost of that versus

136
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,280
bottle nutrients running R water storing

137
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,959
it pumping it man it was expensive so

138
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,279
like and and that's what every start of

139
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,198
the year I don't know about your area

140
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,918
but for me I go pick up I go to like

141
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,038
garden stores in in the spring because

142

148
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,199
to just you know top dress outside and

149

you know what I did I waited to 420 they

166
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:14,159
all every every company has got a April

167
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:16,598
20th has got a sale 20 30% off extra

168
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,560
free shipping blah blah blah so that's

169
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:20,159
the best time of year to to to if you're

170
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,918
if you're planning a grow and you want

171
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,120
to do something try to do it around 420

172
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:25,719
you know what I mean you you'll save a

173
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,280
ton of money shipping and stuff like

174
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,000
that so uh they do like a a water

175
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:32,000
soluble fertilizer so I guess it's it's

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,680
it's very simple it's just not a bunch

177
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,959
of bottles so it's a little bit cheaper

178
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,400
yeah 420 sales man I I do the same exact

179
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,560
thing where I try to get as many as

180
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,478
possible not just equipment but genetics

181
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,079
and also Black Friday is another area

182
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:49,000
where very deep discounts I feel like

183
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,399
Black Friday and 420 are the like the

184
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,639
deepest discounts that's where people

185
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:55,959
and companies really offer the most

186
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,439
percentage off so I'm just like you I

187
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:58,799
take advantage of that yeah you got to

188
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,240
be cheap man you got to stock up you got

189
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,240
to be and that's the best way my opinion

190
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,879
can we get deeper into your indoor

191
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,680
equipment setup and how you went about

192
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,280
it in a budget friendly manner so like

193
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,400
lighting for example do you go with

194
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,439
budget lights or are you kind of paying

195
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,439
a little bit more for a certain you know

196
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:17,839
amount of par or Spectrum also

197
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,120
ventilation system you know what are you

198
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,038
doing for that so on and so forth yeah

199
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,560
yeah first when so when I first started

200
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:26,560
I got the tent I got a setup uh I was

201
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,160
kind of new to it right so I'm like ah

202
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,519
look at these Cheapo beo blurple lights

203
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,439
I'm going to get one of those off of

204
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:35,359
Amazon right and um cuz they were cheap

205
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,719
I was like yeah you know after growing

206
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,639
with it I shook my head a little bit and

207
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,800
go no no no no this is not the way to go

208
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,038
so uh I started looking at some Quantum

209
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,120
boards and this I mean this is going

210
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,120
back probably four years from today so I

211
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,319
mean Quantum boards were where it was at

212
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,360
at the time and I found hlg and you know

213
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,158
an American company but man oh man they

214
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,158
lights I I was seeing great reviews I

215
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:00,319
was seeing a lot of people talking about

216
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:01,598
it but man wasn't able to spend that

217
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,080
kind of money I just I wasn't in the

218
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,399
place to spend that money and and again

219
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:07,198
being cheap I was like no I I not going

220
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,198
to happen so I went out and I started

221
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,360
looking for Alternatives and I found on

222
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,879
Alibaba uh uh a kingbrite it was a

223
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,038
Chinese company that shipped right from

224
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,158
China and it was like I'm going to look

225
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:22,038
into this you know and and and I started

226
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:23,478
Googling it and trying to look at videos

227
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:25,519
and I couldn't find any videos in

228
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:26,839
YouTube I go listen man even even if I'm

229
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,560
doing a break job on a car that I've

230
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,839
never done it before I go to YouTube

231
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,799
it's great it it's such a informative

232
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,759
gives you a little bit of info no

233
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:38,278
nothing on kingbrite so I go you know

234
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,319
what hey I'm going to do this I'm going

235
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:42,200
to start a YouTube channel and I'm going

236
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,159
to you know buy this light and do a

237
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,959
review and do the process of you know

238
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,720
how to get this light going through

239
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,719
customs and and and and doing it so it

240
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,320
it really broke down to like three

241
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,000
things right like first and foremost I

242
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,200
wanted to help other people because

243
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,720
there was no video right um then it was

244
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,600
a you know cheaper alternative to like a

245
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,759
hlg and and you know third I was like

246
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,240
you know what I'm going to start a

247
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:06,879
YouTube channel it's going to be small

248
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,240
and listen I might only have 10

249
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,919
followers 100 followers whatever it is

250
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,799
but I I you know what this is a business

251
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:17,479
opportunity and if this is a business

252
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:20,319
opportunity I can write this light off

253
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,079
so check another savings right so no

254
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,640
matter how big or how small you are

255
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:27,679
starting starting YouTube channel for me

256
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,639
was one of my biggest cheapness moves

257
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,319
that I've done in gardening why because

258
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:34,360
I can you know spend that money before I

259
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,760
get taxed on it and and and did but

260
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,360
listen I I'm I'm not an expert on this I

261
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,480
I I I hired a good accountant I I sat

262
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,919
down with him I paid him for an hour I

263
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,600
said let me pick your brain for an hour

264
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:47,799
I paid him best money I've ever spent he

265
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,600
helped me out he gave me guidance and

266
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:53,359
and and that was great so again that was

267
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,519
my start and then going into other

268
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,440
setups and other systems I I I decided

269
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,440
after the light I'm like you know what I

270
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,720
want to grow an rdwc

271
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,120
I see I see the Internet it's it's the

272
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,360
growth rate is insane I'm like I want to

273
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,679
try

274
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,480
this you know what TurnKey pre-built

275
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:13,679
systems are worth not budget friendly

276
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,519
when I was looking at them so I decided

277
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,319
you know what I'm going to I'm going to

278
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,919
do it all myself I'm going to do a d DIY

279
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,560
I'll do it I'll do another video write

280
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:25,278
it all off and then I was able you know

281
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,679
to buy parts off of Amazon um and and

282
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:27,720
locally and and you know with that

283
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:29,319
mechanical background I had an

284
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,839
irrigation I was able to do all the PIP

285
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:36,120
typing and stuff and and and again being

286
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:38,440
handy and like being able to DIY stuff

287
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,839
is another like godsent to being cheap

288
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,320
in the garden if if you can do stuff

289
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,120
it's great right right so I mean I just

290
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,399
just compar to the pre-built I was like

291
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,560
half or less than half in price so it

292
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,078
was like man when I talk to people and

293
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,518
I'm talking to them on on social media

294
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:55,919
and I see they're they're putting out

295
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:57,879
content they're doing videos I go you

296
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,958
writing this off you know are you are

297
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:01,838
you do you got like amaz links do you

298
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,759
have like Amazon affiliate or associate

299
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,200
marketing whatever like it's free to

300
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,838
sign up I go sign up get some links put

301
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,040
them in your video write all this stuff

302
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,079
off man

303
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:15,039
because that that that and again this is

304
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:16,638
listen this is Canada and every place is

305
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,879
different but hire that account and pay

306
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,519
that money and and and just and help

307
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,759
it'll it'll help offset gardening cost

308
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,278
big time yeah that's a really good idea

309
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,200
going back to the Alibaba kingbrite I'm

310
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:30,078
actually went to your channel and sorted

311
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,680
it by oldest videos been doing YouTube

312
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:36,239
videos now for 4 years 124 videos so

313
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,759
that's that's crazy man congrats on uh

314
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,519
all that there a lot of hard work is

315
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,919
kind of what I'm getting at and uh that

316
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,120
was a good idea for a video over 15,000

317
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:47,240
views on that now I've heard of some

318
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,360
people having bad experiences with

319
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,360
Alibaba uh in particular actually this

320
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,959
King brigh I'd like to know is this

321
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,200
still working today because I believe

322
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,638
they only offer a one-year warranty

323
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,040
where hlg for example I believe offers

324
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,720
three plus year warranty if I'm not

325
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:05,120
mistaken um is that light still working

326
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,440
good for you or what that light has

327
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,360
since been gone from the channel so

328
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,519
that's um it when I had it it was great

329
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,839
it was a little bit of a setup and

330
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:15,519
whatever and I did it in that video

331
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,480
because it was the instructions weren't

332
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,759
that good and and trying to deal with

333
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,320
people on Alibaba the time difference is

334
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,919
is is usually like you're in day and

335
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,360
they're night so it's hard to deal with

336
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,360
that so 100% warranty would have been if

337
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,919
I would have ever had an issue uh

338
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,560
warranty would have been a problem I

339
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,639
would have assumed just because of the

340
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:36,919
dealings but uh I sold it to a guy and

341
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,278
on like on Marketplace or whatever and

342
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:40,000
and he never got back to me so I'm

343
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:43,639
assuming it worked for him it it had

344
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,759
decent parts and yeah it would I I used

345
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:48,198
it for four grows probably and I never

346
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:49,879
had a problem with it that's awesome you

347
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:51,759
got some good usage out of there and you

348
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:53,879
able to resell it so you're able to get

349
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,799
some money back from it so that that's

350
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:58,919
awesome now would you recommend any

351
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:01,719
other equipment to get off of Alibaba or

352
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:03,599
just lighting so that is the only thing

353
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,879
I've ever done so I I really only speak

354
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,519
to what I know and listen the process

355
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,519
was a bit weird um and this was at the

356
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,679
time four years ago this Trump was in

357
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,600
office in the United States so there was

358
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:18,159
like extra duties and extra like tariffs

359
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,278
and and it was kind of

360
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:23,519
weird I I I at the time it was great it

361
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:25,600
was simple I I sent I sent my deposit or

362
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,159
my money by via credit card and I had

363
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,399
tracking in a couple of days I had to

364
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:31,480
spend a little bit extra when I got to

365
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:34,600
the door and in like uh brokerage fees

366
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,639
or whatever but still it was it was

367
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,199
pretty cheap so worth it worth a if

368
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:42,799
you're on a budget and you don't have

369
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:45,439
that money for that great best light

370
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:48,000
with the best service and the best

371
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,680
warranty it's an option I think yeah

372
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,278
absolutely and some of the other

373
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:55,758
equipment you can really find cheaper

374
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:58,039
options on you know Amazon or any other

375
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,600
website sometimes going directly to the

376
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:02,519
manufacturer's website it is beneficial

377
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,480
the company's website is beneficial a

378
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,879
little bit cheaper than going through

379
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,879
Amazon where Amazon charges companies

380
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:10,159
10% I think per sale or something like

381
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:12,399
that but as far as ventilation one thing

382
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,879
I wanted to mention was you don't have

383
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,440
to go and buy AC infiniti's automated

384
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,360
ventilation that comes with a controller

385
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,920
which is over $100 right you can get an

386
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,600
intake fan for under 50 bucks I believe

387
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,078
you know now it's going to come with the

388
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,879
the variable speed controller so you're

389
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,479
not really going to have the nice

390
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:32,879
options of going onto your phone and the

391
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,278
app and controlling everything there and

392
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,439
uh hit things automatically coming on

393
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:38,360
and off as needed but if you're on a

394
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,680
budget you need to keep things cheap you

395
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:45,240
can certainly get a inline fan for under

396
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:47,479
50 bucks 6 in 4 in you can find them for

397
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,000
sure so that's another option that I

398
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,199
think i' mentioned yeah yeah know that's

399
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,759
what I started with I just a basic

400
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:58,439
4-inch fan with like a a speed dial and

401
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,800
you're right it's cheap but cheap is not

402
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,199
always like like there's got to be a

403
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:04,278
point where you go is this worth it or

404
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:06,078
is it not worth it because like you said

405
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,679
I I you're right da infin is a little

406
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,278
bit more expensive but that control in

407
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,439
the app man I can be laying in bed and I

408
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:15,639
can be controlling my phone right I go

409
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,120
what did I M up or what did I do that's

410
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:20,120
worth something it it it is definitely

411
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,600
worth a little bit extra money to have

412
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,600
that you know that

413
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,278
interconnectivity yeah some things you

414
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,800
don't want to cheap on I completely

415
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:30,000
agree yeah it can be worth it to spend a

416
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:31,838
little bit more for better now what

417
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,159
about genetics would you spend a little

418
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,399
bit more for good genetics or do you

419
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,799
look for cheap

420
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,839
genetics and genetics isn't that one of

421
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:44,000
the most complex questions when it comes

422
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:45,199
to gardening for us again to me I go

423
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,759
where do you start like you know what I

424
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,599
mean like I listen I've Done Cheap

425
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,800
genetics like cheap cheapap real cheap

426
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,278
you know what I mean and then I've done

427
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:57,479
exp super expensive genetics um super

428
00:15:54,278 --> 00:16:00,240
super expensive genetics and you know

429
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,480
what not always do you spend more do you

430
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,799
get more or does it equal you know more

431
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,440
money better genetics but listen let's

432
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:09,439
be honest great genetics are not going

433
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,360
to be super super cheap so where do you

434
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,360
draw that line and and and you know

435
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,720
balance between quality genetics you

436
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,600
know like like a brand that's putting

437
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,800
into work to make them good you know

438
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,079
getting getting to like that F3 or you

439
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:24,639
know doing the work and behind it and

440
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:26,359
then you know hey well listen this is

441
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,560
their third version of this like it's

442
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,680
got to be better you know what I mean

443
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:31,278
they're putting in the time and you know

444
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,758
and or companies that that you know

445
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,039
offer some sort of whether it's a

446
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,440
guarantee or a

447
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:38,078
warranty um and and again you can you

448
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,639
can you know spend a little bit less or

449
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:41,159
a little bit more and get that warranty

450
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:44,159
and then you get that ease of use where

451
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:46,639
you can you know pop a 10 pack hunt

452
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,838
through it try to find that unicorn

453
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,079
where you're going to go oh this is the

454
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,720
Holy Grail man I I got to reverse this

455
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:56,159
or I took clones and then you know still

456
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,519
fall back on some coverage for for you

457
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,278
know uh like like that warranty I guess

458
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,120
that's a word but again so you know

459
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:04,359
backing of their of this and you can

460
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,919
recoup some of your losses and then you

461
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:07,159
know it's kind of like a win-win you

462
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:11,160
didn't you didn't lose out and you

463
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,679
didn't spend a lot so that genetics man

464
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,959
it's a tough one I feel like this is

465
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:19,720
another area where you can Target Black

466
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:21,880
Friday and 420 deep deep discounts I had

467
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,838
the chillo G I think it was 40% off or

468
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,319
50% off for Black Friday same thing for

469
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:28,438
420 it's and there's so many breeders

470
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,879
out there quality breeders that are

471
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,320
given discounts so I would recommend

472
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,200
people look during sale times is really

473
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:38,319
to to pick them up right not really

474
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,279
offse when things aren't discounted yeah

475
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,200
yeah like like I don't like I don't I

476
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,839
don't know if you guys have anything

477
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,160
like Canadian Tire but in Canada it's a

478
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:47,359
place called Canadian Tire and it's like

479
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,440
uh it's got blah blah it's got

480
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,000
everything it's but if you buy something

481
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,679
from Canadian Tire and it's not on sale

482
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,558
you've messed up right so you're right

483
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:58,519
being on sale being that Frugal Shopper

484
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,440
is going to save you so much money year

485
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:03,200
to year here it's ridiculous so you're

486
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,480
right uhuh like yeah all those sales and

487
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,519
then you also kind of mentioned it

488
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,400
directly relates to genetics is cloning

489
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,158
right so sure you're going to buy seeds

490
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,360
to begin but you don't have to buy seeds

491
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:14,520
ever again if you don't want to you can

492
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,558
just clone clone clone clone clone so

493
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:18,079
another great way to save money yeah

494
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,599
yeah for sure and and again but it's

495
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:23,038
it's it's try to find that one that like

496
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,279
I know I know for me anyways I had one

497
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:25,879
and this was when I first started

498
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:29,000
growing that four years ago under that

499
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,159
King brigh and and I found a I called

500
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,960
that was great it was perfect it held my

501
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:37,679
back it was amazing and I didn't clone

502
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,759
it so I lost out and it's like I've been

503
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,519
chasing that strain I I've boughten uh

504
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,279
four different 10 packs of the same

505
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,319
strain and I've tried to get it and of

506
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:50,200
course well you know everybody knows

507
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,359
that's growing plants one seed to

508
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,798
another you're going to find something

509
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,439
different and it's like that's you're

510
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:57,759
right once you get it and you've got

511
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,000
that thing cloning it and and maybe

512
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,319
spending a little bit extra money money

513
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,319
on a second tent for a mother tent like

514
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:05,558
me I

515
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:08,879
have three tents now 2 by two for

516
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:11,639
mothers 5x5 for my main grow and a 2x4

517
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,840
for vegging and mothers too right so

518
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,759
that helps you keep that genetic alive

519
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:19,720
and and live and strong you know yeah

520
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:22,759
absolutely I also have a a cultivar that

521
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:27,159
I had a beautiful plant of and I didn't

522
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:30,079
clone it and I so much regret you know I

523
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:32,080
don't wish that upon anybody it's like

524
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,759
and I bought multiple packs trying to

525
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:38,199
find it just like you and didn't find it

526
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:39,440
so I uh I'm now like monster cropping if

527
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,880
I really find something special I'll

528
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,640
monster crop it right so cloning it in

529
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,080
flower and bringing it back to the veg

530
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,480
stage you know I'll definitely do that

531
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,519
because I don't want to miss out I don't

532
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,200
want to lose genetics anymore yeah and

533
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:53,279
that's and that's never again is that

534
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,720
ever going to happen to me while I'm

535
00:19:53,279 --> 00:20:01,119
hunting that extra tent can can can save

536
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:04,240
you heartache I guess what it is 100%

537
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:06,079
let's get into some of the processes and

538
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,960
I kind of want to know how you do things

539
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,599
and then as we're going along and you're

540
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,400
explaining things maybe you can mention

541
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,038
how you're keeping a cheap going through

542
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,159
those processes so let's start with

543
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,480
germinating and planting seeds kind of

544
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:20,320
walk us through your process there yeah

545
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,919
so I'm pretty old school on this um now

546
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,200
the only problem with my place is I've

547
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,840
got I'm in a basement and I'm in Canada

548
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,759
and during the winter it's cold in the

549
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:30,079
basement during the summer I'm I'm I

550
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:33,119
don't like the heat so it's cold in my

551
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:36,399
basement so I'm always battling cold um

552
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:39,119
so the the the cheapest way I found to

553
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,640
do this is is just put you know get a

554
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,119
bunch of seeds put them in the Solo cups

555
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,759
put them on a heating mat put them in a

556
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:48,839
dome and you know control that in a very

557
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:50,599
small area not in the big tent where I'm

558
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:52,319
spending extra money on lights and extra

559
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:56,158
money on this and extra money on that

560
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:59,960
small based you know a clone Dome that's

561
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,960
you know maybe that can fit 10 Solo cups

562
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,600
and then I I just go right into right

563
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,798
into the soil and I just barely barely

564
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:10,599
below the top uh I don't go very deep I

565
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:13,400
I've had problems going deep um before

566
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:15,839
so I just I I pretty much go I mean

567
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,798
barely just enough soil to cover it

568
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:22,240
right and then while um and then and

569
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:24,759
then just just water very very you know

570
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,919
slow and use because again always

571
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:30,679
looking at overwatering right

572
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:32,679
so um it's it's it's cheap in the fact

573
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:35,960
that I have Solo cups all the time so I

574
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:38,360
mean I get that it's probably not

575
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,720
environmentally sound but again I I

576
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:44,199
Costco man I got I got 400 cups in my

577
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,640
pantry upstairs right so it's it's it's

578
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,798
one of those things that it's always

579
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:55,440
there um so I I to do that so again it's

580
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:58,319
it's it's is there a cheaper way maybe

581
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,080
going to do some smaller stuff but ah

582
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,399
again

583
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:04,319
Solo cups that stuff that's that's sort

584
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:08,559
of in the germinating stage um for once

585
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:10,798
it goes to seedling um I I I really that

586
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,558
that key for me is that not overwatering

587
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:15,798
so I I have a bunch of stuff from Amazon

588
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:18,119
these little 60 mil syringes that I find

589
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:19,359
are handy I use those you can get a

590
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:22,759
bunch of them for like 10 bucks or

591
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:24,678
something like that Amazon for sure uh

592
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:26,278
like I said Amazon and Amazon associate

593
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:27,679
links for somebody who's starting out

594
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:30,359
there's so many things you can use on

595
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,278
Amazon that are key so um just keeping

596
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:33,959
that soil moist you know in that sort of

597
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:36,919
like inch and a half circle around where

598
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,480
I put the seed in and and you know and

599
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:40,400
just and just water it daily so it's

600
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,038
it's labor intensive it's it's not I'm

601
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,840
not automating at this point um I'm just

602
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,240
doing it I want to be in there I want to

603
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:48,240
be touching it I want to be loving it

604
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,079
all you know right then in that part

605
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,159
right so yeah Solo cups reusing Solo

606
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:55,199
cups that's a big one right how to save

607
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:56,960
money should should be buying Solo cups

608
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,278
over and over and over again I've been

609
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,159
using the same ones for I don't even

610
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:03,319
know how many years plastic bags over

611
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:04,679
the cups instead of Domes instead of

612
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:07,399
going on buying the Dome I usually just

613
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,960
use plastic bags make that little uh

614
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,600
micro climate in the in there to begin

615
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,880
until the seeds until it sprouts from

616
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,079
The Medium I reuse the same bags for

617
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,480
year I think I've been reusing the same

618
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:20,079
bags for eight years now uh reusing soil

619
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,599
too that's another thing where you can

620
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:24,639
save money is if you're able to actually

621
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:28,678
reuse the soil over and over again I

622
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,640
spent so many years buying bags of soil

623
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,960
and using synthetic nutrients and

624
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,919
thinking that I wasn't able to reuse it

625
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,640
now a lot of people are just going to

626
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,400
throw that out in their backyard and

627
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,278
they say h that's reusing it right it's

628
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,840
still being used for plants that are

629
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:44,038
Outdoors okay but you can also reuse

630
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,319
soil indoors and a lot of people do it

631
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:48,519
with Organics you don't need to flush or

632
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:51,519
anything like that you just continue to

633
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:53,119
amend and you get soil tests and then

634
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,599
amend according to the soil test and

635
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:55,599
then reuse that soil over and over again

636
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,439
I have the same soil that I've been

637
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:00,038
using for six grows now so it's

638
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,759
definitely possible a lot of people do

639
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:04,079
it and if they're using synthetic

640
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:06,519
nutrients a lot of folks just flush that

641
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,439
soil they'll run water through it try to

642
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:11,000
get to a clean slate where there's

643
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,558
really bit I wouldn't say an inert

644
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,359
entirely but it's kind of drained of

645
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:17,359
most of the nutrition and then they kind

646
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,038
of reuse it from there and I've had

647
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:22,519
mixed results using that doing that

648
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:24,038
method but uh a lot of people do it with

649
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:27,079
success there so I figured I'd mention

650
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:28,960
that yeah yeah and and I'm that's so I

651
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:31,199
was reusing Mo soil I've got a bin like

652
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,399
you said I've got Solo cups I reuse them

653
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,880
I wash them I clean them I have a bin

654
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:37,519
full of stuff what's my worm castings

655
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,559
like one of those like Costco bins or

656
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,278
whatever it's like you know two two and

657
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:42,879
a half fet wide but I have a garden

658
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,759
outside and me and my wife we do a lot

659
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,240
of gardening outside we like we like to

660
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:50,200
um do jalapenos and and and peppers and

661
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,120
lettuce and cucumbers man cucumbers are

662
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,640
the greatest so yeah that's where all my

663
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:56,079
soil goes um out there and get get a

664
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,840
little the peed in there and all that

665
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:59,798
stuff in there it's great for that so

666
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,798
you're right it's reusing it but no you

667
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:05,200
you definitely can reuse it I'm a big

668
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:07,558
yeah yeah for sure but um I I found and

669
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,000
listen I I know you're very organic and

670
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:12,079
I'm not very organic I had I had an

671
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,720
organic grow that I was like I'm when I

672
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,240
did it outside and the taste that came

673
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,640
from it I'm like I got to like even my

674
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,359
peppers I put my peppers in organic

675
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,120
they're hotter they're sweeter they're

676
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,319
tastier I'm like I got to do this

677
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,839
indoors and man I went to indoors and I

678
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:29,519
had nothing but fungus snats and fungus

679
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:32,398
snats fungus snats I hate those little

680
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,000
things and uh I gone away from Organics

681
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:35,439
inside I wish I could do it better and I

682
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,159
wish I maybe I should do a little bit

683
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,440
more reading into it but the synthetic

684
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:42,320
man it's pretty decent for me yeah you

685
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,759
said I'm very organic I so disagree with

686
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:45,119
you I know I've got a book out on it and

687
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:48,319
stuff like that but I still do have

688
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:50,119
synthetic runs and Sanic too that's a

689
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:53,038
lot of people grow Sanic right using

690
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:55,239
both synthetic and organic inputs which

691
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,359
feel like it's kind of an underrated way

692
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,759
to go about it you know yeah yeah know

693
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:01,079
you're right you can suppl that's what I

694
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:02,398
found outside when I wasn't top dressing

695
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:04,558
enough I was like o these plants are

696
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:07,398
hurting little shot of little shot of

697
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:08,720
food boom boom they perked right up real

698
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:10,519
quick yeah you can definitely get away

699
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,079
with that for sure now how about like

700
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:13,639
environment conditions obviously

701
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:16,439
Outdoors you don't really have control

702
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,840
of the temperature humidity CO2 all that

703
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,600
stuff but uh indoors when you're growing

704
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:23,839
indoors what do you typically aim for

705
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:28,759
for temperature relative humidity and

706
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:30,319
CO2 so this is a good question so for me

707
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:33,558
I try listen you're right I can't do

708
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:37,079
anything outdoors but outdoors I do I I

709
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:38,960
do have um like a little again Cheapo

710
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:41,398
beo not cheap because if I were to try

711
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,278
to build a greenhouse it would be super

712
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:46,519
expensive so I got one of these green

713
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:49,000
houses in a boxes like um uh shelter

714
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:52,038
logic from from Home Depot great little

715
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,480
thing I put it up um and and here it's

716
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:55,319
always like I'm in the I'm on the East

717
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,159
Coast sort of mid East Coast I don't

718
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:59,200
even know it's super hot and humid is

719
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,559
what it boils down to

720
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,679
and I'm always on the lookout for that

721
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:04,759
white powdery mildew right like and this

722
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:06,759
is where that genetics you know can

723
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:10,319
really play play a role in it too and

724
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:14,278
and so this year I ran some plants out

725
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:17,359
last year from seed four seeds and three

726
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:20,038
of them perfect nice not a single and

727
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:23,000
then the fourth one white powdery Meo

728
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:25,759
from head to toe instantly like it was

729
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,679
so bad so guess what that one just we

730
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:29,359
just cut it down got rid of it cuz I

731
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,080
don't want to mess with that and those

732
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,519
three guess what I cloned them now

733
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:35,678
they're outside I'm going to be I'm

734
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:38,038
hoping not so much white powder and Me

735
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,759
Do Right but

736
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:42,879
um I then what what I do in my in my

737
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:46,319
Greenhouse is I I've got power out there

738
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:50,720
so I I defoliate like crazy and have fan

739
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:53,359
like just cheap Walmart oscillating fans

740
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,399
18 bucks like cheap like Canada I don't

741
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:56,558
know what they are in the States but

742
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:57,719
like just cheap cheap cheap ones put

743
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,398
them right beside the plant blowing

744
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,919
right on it keeps the air moving and and

745
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:06,199
that seems to you know be be pretty nice

746
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:08,120
so again defoliating is is great to help

747
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:12,759
that outside but

748
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:15,079
inside um I I I I I started on the cheap

749
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:16,599
route and and I really wasn't like I

750
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:19,398
said I had that fan with the with the

751
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:20,798
little the knob and and it was it was it

752
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:23,119
just I couldn't get to where I needed it

753
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:26,398
to be I wanted it to be a nice

754
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:28,479
temperature just you know under 27c I

755
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,798
don't know what that is a Fahrenheit my

756
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,360
H couldn't tell you um but anyways I I

757
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,798
try to keep it you know with that and

758
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:37,959
with that fan it was either too cold or

759
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:40,918
IJ it it was too hot so that's when I I

760
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,919
and I I found AC infinity and man their

761
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:46,759
controllers while not cheap worth every

762
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,759
nickel in my opinion um because it just

763
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:51,000
it makes it so much easier like and the

764
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:53,919
control so I I've I I've got everything

765
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,119
dialed in to my proper temps my proper

766
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,440
humidity I get that VPD in a nice good

767
00:28:56,119 --> 00:29:00,278
zone for all my different areas and I

768
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,840
and I bump up the humidity and I do the

769
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:03,839
app is so I I don't even know how to use

770
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:05,398
the controller anymore I go I used to

771
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,599
know how to use the controller when

772
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:09,759
before the app came out now it's just

773
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,839
the app man it's it's it like I said

774
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:15,240
from bed from the couch from anything it

775
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:17,558
is so

776
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,000
again just a little bit more up front on

777
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:23,038
that unit can can help not get mildew

778
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,839
not get mold which again to me that's

779
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:27,119
saving money if I'm not throwing like

780
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:29,319
that one outside I had to throw it out I

781
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,158
put all that money into to to to Gaia

782
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:34,240
green I put all the effort into the soil

783
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:35,919
the bags everything so to to to spend

784
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,319
that little bit up front which is worth

785
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:42,038
the pennies and the Nickels it'll save

786
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:44,839
you on the end on loss so again um yeah

787
00:29:42,038 --> 00:29:47,398
and and now I I've I just started we're

788
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:50,278
talking about environment I just started

789
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:51,558
CO2 um very new to it and and and I just

790
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:54,640
started Coco too I was telling you I was

791
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:58,678
doing Coco so I I'm I'm doing cocoa and

792
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:01,120
CO2 in a sealed tent and I'm doing it in

793
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:02,960
very small Solo cups for this Solo Cup

794
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:04,639
grow that I'm doing which is kind of a

795
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,759
silly thing but it's kind of fun it's

796
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,240
new it's outside of my comfort zone but

797
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:12,240
the CO2 man it it's kind of neat to to

798
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,919
deal with so um dialing that in it it's

799
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,558
a little bit hotter than I'm normally

800
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,840
and this one I'm doing in Fahrenheit

801
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:20,599
because all the stuff I'm reading is in

802
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:22,359
Fahrenheit so um I'm at about 85 86 and

803
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:25,798
I'm at about SE and then I'm in veg

804
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:28,519
right now and about 75 to 80 uh relative

805
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:30,440
humidity and that has my VPD just under

806
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:34,759
one I think it's like 0.9 or 08 or

807
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:37,278
something like that and um man it it's

808
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:39,919
it's insane the growth I I'm un I'm I

809
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:42,960
can't believe how much it is so it it's

810
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:46,480
probably rivaling the rdwc when I did

811
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:50,038
that it's so fast but because I've never

812
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,759
done CO2 before you know CO2 is

813
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:55,759
expensive I get to rent a tank and fill

814
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:59,519
it up but if I can get my plant to grow

815
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:01,960
twice as fast in the Ved stage I'm

816
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,159
really interested see during flowering

817
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,240
and see how this is going to turn out

818
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,919
because if I can spend that little bit

819
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,720
upfront on the CO2 but the end result is

820
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,919
I have more medicine well then I'm

821
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:18,038
saving money in theory I have to do that

822
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:19,720
calculation chees out on that one but H

823
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:22,398
you know it's again trying that new

824
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,120
thing so yeah yeah 100% I mean yeah do

825
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:26,079
the math figure out okay you're spending

826
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:28,119
this much on co2 you're getting this

827
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:31,278
much more yield well that much more more

828
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:33,879
yield would be this in the dispensary so

829
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:36,319
yeah I can imagine that did would be

830
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,399
beneficial from a cost standpoint to run

831
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:41,558
the CO2 and get the increased yield

832
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:43,638
let's move on to the veg stage so plant

833
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:46,038
training is done in the veg stage

834
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:48,240
watering feeding talk us through those

835
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:52,480
processes how you go about doing them

836
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,480
sure sure sure yeah so to me training so

837
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:59,079
fun so rewarding

838
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:01,880
so um good for like keeping you like me

839
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:03,798
I I'm in a 5x5 I wish I had more space

840
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,000
but I only have a 5x5 so I really have

841
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:08,759
to optimize it for that

842
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,519
tent and and training is that how I do

843
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:12,720
that to to optimize you know the every

844
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:14,038
square inch of the tent try to get every

845
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,919
square inch of tent doesn't always

846
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:19,319
happens but I used to use plant tie

847
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:21,440
downs and like uh paper clips or or or

848
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:22,879
like uh clothed pins my wife was always

849
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,919
giving me crap cuz she'd never have

850
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,960
cloes pins um and and just attach it to

851
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,120
the pot and like pull it down tie it

852
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,399
like twist tie kind of plant things but

853
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:35,158
now I've gone away from that I'm I'm

854
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:36,918
100% Bud Clips uh from Bud trainer

855
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:38,360
they're they're they're Clips man

856
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:40,240
they're they're the perfect angle in my

857
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:43,240
opinion they're not aggressive they're

858
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,638
aggressive enough but man their attack

859
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,359
on the angle is great so then then it's

860
00:32:45,638 --> 00:32:50,599
like self-contained too right so I was

861
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:52,839
always a problem with the plant ties I

862
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:55,119
have I got big old man hands here my

863
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:56,839
hands are big right so to try to get in

864
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,518
there and mess with the plants and and

865
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:00,398
and and defoliate and stuff I was

866
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,558
hitting the hitting the plant ties

867
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:05,000
breaking the plant losing out on that so

868
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:07,918
and these are all reusable you can throw

869
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,159
them in dishwasher you clean them um and

870
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,480
again uh even when I was watering it'

871
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,840
get it get whatever so for in this veg

872
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,960
stage I use that on my outdoor plants my

873
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:19,519
indoor

874
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:22,880
plants and just just just make it a work

875
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:26,440
of art really and get it you know um get

876
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:30,799
it to where so and then um watering and

877
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:33,960
feeding um inside in veg I I like I said

878
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:37,359
I use that uh I have a a matrix system

879
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:40,159
from um Flor flex and again back savings

880
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:41,839
that's saving time and money sure saving

881
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,919
my back another one of my higher

882
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:46,119
priorities and this thing I've got it on

883
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,639
a table I've got it on a flood table

884
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:49,518
like an ebb and flow table but I don't

885
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:52,479
have anything cut out and I just put my

886
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,038
plants in there it's got a manifold I

887
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,200
can do up to eight 10 plants I I've done

888
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:58,759
two heads I've done it whatever and and

889
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,159
I can water it and it and it's great it

890
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:04,079
just runs off into the table shop vac I

891
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:05,559
don't have to pump it and drain it and

892
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,159
and I just again to me that was the

893
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:10,279
cheapest way to do it and and to not

894
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,079
have to bend over so that that's great

895
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,800
and and that's that that sort of it just

896
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:17,519
it just keeps the watering so much

897
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,720
easier yeah when it comes to training I

898
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:21,559
started using those Bud trainer Clips

899
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:23,799
they've been working out really good so

900
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,799
far for me although they are a little

901
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,000
bit pricey in my opinion I think I ended

902
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,800
up buying a 20 pack for 20 bucks or

903
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,398
something like that so I used to go the

904
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,679
cheap route there as well just with like

905
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:37,638
ties Garden ties you can buy them for

906
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,240
like two three bucks at your local Home

907
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:42,679
Depot or Lowe's in the gardening section

908
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:46,398
and then using those ties and bringing

909
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:49,240
the branches down and either piercing

910
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:51,000
your fabric pot with like uh safety pins

911
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:54,799
for example some people use paper paper

912
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,199
clips binder clips is what I use very

913
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,079
often actually Clos pins I've used those

914
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:01,519
in the past as well those are a little

915
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:03,400
bit more uh I say finicky but they don't

916
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:05,880
I don't really hold on to the pot as

917
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,358
much using those in the garden ties but

918
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,720
yeah anything kind of lying around the

919
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:11,480
house that's a good way to save money is

920
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:13,799
using those things when you're doing the

921
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,000
plant training now as far as watering

922
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,240
actually getting littleit deeper into

923
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,719
water you mentioned you use R water I do

924
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:21,159
too now there's a little bit of a

925
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,959
misconception about RO water that people

926
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:24,960
think that it's thousands of dollars to

927
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,119
get a home unit system that's actually

928
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,880
not the case I've got one that is I

929
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,119
believe it's 200 bucks I paid for it on

930
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:35,280
Amazon and it's a 1: one instead of a 1:

931
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,160
three and what do I mean by that I mean

932
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,640
for every one gallon of water some

933
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:43,199
systems will waste three gallons of

934
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:45,679
water but my 1: one system one gallon of

935
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:48,358
water will waste one gallon of water now

936
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:50,719
you can also take that waste line from

937
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:52,400
your AO system put into a bucket for

938
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:54,439
example 5 gallon bucket and use that on

939
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,240
your outdoor plants that's what I do

940
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,400
some people use that water they put it

941
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,000
into their toilet for

942
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,720
they save money there using that waste

943
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,880
water but again ways to keep kind of

944
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,759
keep things cheap filtered water I can't

945
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,160
use my tap water unfortunately but a lot

946
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,160
of people do use their tap water they're

947
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:12,679
able to well water but if you do go that

948
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:14,679
route you might want to get it tested

949
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:17,639
first to make sure that it is going to

950
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:20,960
be usable for your medicinal plants for

951
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:22,719
example because we all know now that if

952
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,199
there's an imbalance of nutrients in the

953
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:27,799
medium some nutrients can lock out

954
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,519
others prevent uptake from happening and

955
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,440
it could just be a rough battle trying

956
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,000
to get through a grow because you've got

957
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,240
what you think is the deficiency but it

958
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,358
actually could be an excess or vice

959
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:40,519
versa and uh yeah so fig I'd mention

960
00:36:38,358 --> 00:36:43,000
those things about water yeah and you

961
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:44,759
know what listen my my ppm's coming out

962
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,920
of my well I have hard

963
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:51,280
water it's like 550 PPM like I have no

964
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,800
choice but to R it and you're right yeah

965
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,599
no R is not like when you look at 500 if

966
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,079
I was to start with 500 and add

967
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:59,480
nutrients

968
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,720
not I'm not I'm going to kill the plant

969
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,920
right so yeah it it it it isn't that bad

970
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:06,199
and getting back to the cheap I I I know

971
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,639
you were talking about the bud trainer

972
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:11,879
ones I bought some of the one off Amazon

973
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:13,920
that's how I started went away from the

974
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,400
ties I there was so many different

975
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,159
people whether they were 3D printing

976
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,880
them or whether they were there were so

977
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:22,679
many different sort of angles and

978
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,838
whatever I I felt I some of the cheaper

979
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:26,239
ones they didn't have like I don't know

980
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:28,519
what bud I don't know how they came up

981
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:30,799
with their their their method of their

982
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:32,759
their Bend because a lot of the other

983
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,160
ones the cheap ones they either cut into

984
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,440
the pl into the plant after you know

985
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:41,879
only a very short period of

986
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:45,880
time and and it it or it was too much of

987
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:48,599
a Bend so I found that that again but

988
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,280
you I buy I'm you have 20 Clips that's I

989
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,880
don't need to buy any more Clips like

990
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,599
that those ones are going to be around

991
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,838
for a long long time I find myself

992
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:58,680
putting them on and taking them off

993
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:59,759
pretty quickly versus the ties I would

994
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:01,719
tie them down on the side of the grow

995
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,040
pod they would stay on the plant for a

996
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:07,199
while the clips you can slide them on

997
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:09,000
and then literally within like a week or

998
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:11,039
so I'm sliding it off at that point it's

999
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,079
staying the branch is staying as the

1000
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:16,519
angle that it was bent down to with the

1001
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:17,880
clip so um yeah 20 might be enough I I

1002
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:20,318
think I want to get a couple more packs

1003
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,720
actually just cuz I grow a lot of plants

1004
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:22,960
here but yeah you can certainly get away

1005
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:25,078
with if you just go to a small number of

1006
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,920
plants just one pack so might be worth

1007
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:29,318
it to invest in that brand name one

1008
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,960
Which is higher quality versus the

1009
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:33,599
Cheapo ones I've seen the Cheapo ones on

1010
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,039
Amazon and they can get pretty cheap but

1011
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,160
a lot of people having problems with

1012
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:39,400
them breaking as well so yeah yeah yeah

1013
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:41,719
well and like you said you take it off a

1014
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:45,519
week use on the same plant up higher or

1015
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:46,838
keep and and again it it's it's it's

1016
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:48,719
yeah it's good stuff now how about the

1017
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:50,880
flower stage is there anything in the

1018
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,759
flower stage that you can think of that

1019
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,519
kind of you do that is a little bit on

1020
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,200
the cheaper side versus uh you know kind

1021
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:59,639
of spending more money towards doing

1022
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:02,318
things and flower yeah okay yeah so what

1023
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:05,039
I do is I I I do use trellis nets for

1024
00:39:02,318 --> 00:39:07,599
training and I I've started with the

1025
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:08,880
cheap ones the plastic ones and and they

1026
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,680
were you know they were I was throwing

1027
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,000
them out I go this is wasteful I keep

1028
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:13,559
having to buy them to me that's not

1029
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,960
saving money because I have to spend

1030
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:19,279
money on them all the time so I I went

1031
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:21,039
with a uh reusable uh washable uh

1032
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,000
trellis net and now that's how I use to

1033
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:26,519
keep my my main colas separated and and

1034
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,480
not overlapping each other and I have

1035
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:30,159
two of them I have one one right on the

1036
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,039
before the flip that I do because we're

1037
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,838
going to see that stretch I put that one

1038
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:36,800
down and I try to as it's stretching I I

1039
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:38,838
I I try to manipulate the the the colas

1040
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,160
into each one of the little squares and

1041
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:43,639
then that goes up and then I and then

1042
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:45,519
and then the second trellis net I put up

1043
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:47,440
and that's pretty much just for you know

1044
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:51,318
weight and stuff like that but keeping

1045
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:53,720
those those those colas separated um

1046
00:39:51,318 --> 00:39:55,480
saves headaches at the end and throwing

1047
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:58,000
it out cuz I I had some that were

1048
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,159
overlapping and touching each other and

1049
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,599
man at the start of my growing that was

1050
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:05,519
like ooh and then sure enough I had some

1051
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:08,318
moisture in there it wasn't good and and

1052
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:09,679
it just was it was all bad so again um

1053
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:12,119
flowering

1054
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:13,159
stage that that was my biggest thing and

1055
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:15,559
then

1056
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:19,879
dehumidifying um the air right like

1057
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:22,318
keeping it super dry also a must I mean

1058
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:25,358
that environment control is a must and

1059
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:27,358
again a nice cheap dehumidifier from

1060
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:29,039
Canadian Tower Home Depot the the

1061
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:31,719
cheapest one you can get on sale of

1062
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:34,199
course like again that that that that

1063
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:37,639
environmental control is is stable and

1064
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:41,078
and and again to to to to keep it cheap

1065
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:44,400
I I I try to I try to man it's so like a

1066
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:47,039
balance between so many colas in that

1067
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,358
5x5 area versus that sometimes I I cut

1068
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:52,159
down Main shoots and just open it up

1069
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:54,159
just to to have that that that area

1070
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:57,440
where it's going to be nice and and Airy

1071
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:59,759
and and nice and dry and I I I hate

1072
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,800
throwing stuff out it makes me sad every

1073
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,520
time so and cost like I just wasted all

1074
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,560
that money and effort right and soil and

1075
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:10,400
stuff so keeping your keeping it cheap

1076
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:12,679
while keeping it clean and keeping it

1077
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,000
that's again that's to me the best you

1078
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:17,118
mentioned D humidifier and I'm the

1079
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,920
opposite I'm always running a humidifier

1080
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,720
because it's so dry here and there are

1081
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,318
DIY humidifiers just search on YouTube

1082
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:26,959
DIY humidifier you should find a result

1083
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:29,719
there and there's one in particular that

1084
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,240
I know of that uses that tub that you

1085
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:35,078
mentioned that you use for like soil and

1086
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:36,519
stuff the the 2T 2 and 1/2t long tub by

1087
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:38,800
what is it like a foot and a half or

1088
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:41,318
something like that maybe and somebody's

1089
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,200
making a humidifier out of that so if

1090
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:46,440
you want to keep things cheap and not go

1091
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:48,199
and buy a a humidifier you can certainly

1092
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,000
build your own and that could

1093
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:51,559
potentially be a cheaper option so you

1094
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,920
might want to look into that one yeah

1095
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:55,759
and then another thing too I I I

1096
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,159
struggle sometimes depending on what

1097
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,000
equipment I'm running I I I run a res

1098
00:41:57,159 --> 00:42:02,960
reservoir for water and you know

1099
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,280
freaking water chillers are not cheap

1100
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,720
they are stupid expensive so what I

1101
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,280
found and what I did was a swamp cooler

1102
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:13,318
um for that and what all that really is

1103
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,599
a swamp cooler it's a fan really it's

1104
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:18,039
blowing on the reservoir and I couldn't

1105
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,318
believe just by putting a fan another

1106
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:22,599
little five or 6 inch fan from Home

1107
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:25,440
Depot I used a little ratchet you know

1108
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:27,920
those I hung it right above my reservoir

1109
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,599
blew it on the water dropped the

1110
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,119
temperature considerably um it did um

1111
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,800
evaporate some of the water so I had to

1112
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,280
keep checking the EC and stuff like that

1113
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,119
but uh it it helped keep the water cool

1114
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,480
so swamp cooler if you're looking for

1115
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:44,358
something to help keep your Reservoir a

1116
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,079
little cool on the cheap Reservoir

1117
00:42:44,358 --> 00:42:49,239
there's another area where you can make

1118
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:52,559
things cheap right I was gifted one by

1119
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:55,239
flexi tank and I pull it up right here

1120
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:58,079
and these things are expensive I mean 50

1121
00:42:55,239 --> 00:43:01,519
plus dollars for Reservoir I keep it

1122
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:04,599
cheap by using a trash barrel you know I

1123
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:07,519
go to a Home Depot I bought a 14 gallon

1124
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:09,760
trash barrel drill the hole in the side

1125
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:11,599
and then put the uh I forget what it's

1126
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,760
called the the piece that kind of screws

1127
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:17,200
in there and and you can run a hose from

1128
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,880
there yeah 10 15 bucks for that or even

1129
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:20,558
a 5 gallon bucket I have a 5 gallon

1130
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,920
bucket that's a reservoir that I use for

1131
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:27,119
some plants and those are what $3 I

1132
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,079
think roughly at Home Depot or or Lowe's

1133
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,760
might be able to even find them even

1134
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,480
cheaper but uh yeah I I would never pay

1135
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,160
money to buy one of those expensive

1136
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,280
Reservoir unless I was in like a larger

1137
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:39,719
setup you know but me being a small home

1138
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,319
grower I would just cheap out and and

1139
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:43,799
use trash barrels and drill a hole in

1140
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:47,239
the side yeah I have a 32 gallon rubber

1141
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:49,280
made uh garbage can and it has wheels

1142
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:51,799
it's great handle Wheels I can move it

1143
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,000
around move it's I never even thought of

1144
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,440
that as as part of it because you're

1145
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,880
right those reservoirs I'm thick walled

1146
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,559
heavy duty

1147
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,039
they're expensive you're right so yeah

1148
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:06,319
no garbage can for sure and wheels too

1149
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:08,960
why not make it easy 100 100% how about

1150
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:11,000
Harvest drying and curing those are

1151
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,079
processes that need to be done after the

1152
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,880
plant is done growing you've harvested

1153
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:17,440
it and then you need to move on to dry

1154
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,160
and cure what ways do you kind of keep

1155
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:24,000
it cheap with those processes yeah so

1156
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:26,279
listen if if I was listen I once helped

1157
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,440
a friend this was many years ago he did

1158
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,880
an outdoor grow and he had

1159
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:34,358
11 lbs of medicine to trim and he was

1160
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:37,400
like we're going to hand trim it I go

1161
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:39,199
are you crazy that's a lot I said I'll

1162
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:42,039
help you but I'm like man I'm going to

1163
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:44,480
take shifts and I got to take breaks and

1164
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:47,800
hand trimming is by far the cheapest way

1165
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:51,199
but with a bad back hand trimming is not

1166
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:55,519
always a thing so what I did uh I waited

1167
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:57,838
obviously to 420 and I I got a sale on

1168
00:44:55,519 --> 00:45:00,239
many websites sell them but here in in

1169
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:03,159
town at at many of the local like um

1170
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:07,039
Grow shops they had uh trimming machines

1171
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:09,318
they were either crazy expensive tumbler

1172
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:12,199
cool thing like these barrels that would

1173
00:45:09,318 --> 00:45:14,639
turn and then they had some of these

1174
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:17,679
tabletop ones and they had ones that

1175
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:19,719
were like the the bowl trimmer um that

1176
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:22,358
you you know that that your hand cranked

1177
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:24,039
it's got fingers and it does it but

1178
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:25,838
they're automated and I was looking at

1179
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:29,800
those and I go man this sure would save

1180
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:32,799
my back I go go whoa $1,400 for a

1181
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,079
tabletop trimmer I go no way so I went

1182
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:39,000
home I started

1183
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:41,400
Googling and I found a a brand that was

1184
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,838
um it was a Chinese brand that was not

1185
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:47,318
like it had no name of the company it

1186
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:50,599
was just this trimmer and it was $200

1187
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:52,039
and some dollars on on sale at 420 so

1188
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:54,119
I'm like I got to do this and that's

1189
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:55,039
what I started doing just to save the

1190
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:58,440
back

1191
00:45:55,039 --> 00:46:00,679
because I can't hand trim just not not

1192
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,280
possible um so I bought these but now

1193
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:07,399
listen these things are very poor

1194
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:11,079
quality um at this very you know bargain

1195
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:13,880
price um but being handy uh it was like

1196
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:16,240
thin tin metal for the legs and sure

1197
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:18,920
enough the welds broke on the like 6

1198
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:21,078
hours in or whatever so it was like a

1199
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,119
man but got a piece of metal put it in

1200
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:24,599
there redid it and it it still works to

1201
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,000
this day I got to pick it up and put it

1202
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:30,039
on these little [ __ ] but that handiness

1203
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,318
came in in in handy so um and and and

1204
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:33,400
again like what are you going to do when

1205
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:35,199
it's that cheap like I got both trimmers

1206
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,920
we I call them stage one and stage two

1207
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:40,279
first one is a tabletop with um like

1208
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,440
it's just fins and you just run it over

1209
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:46,079
and take all the big fan leaves off and

1210
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:48,679
then that sort of automatic bow 8 in or

1211
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,880
10in tumble Weaver I don't even know

1212
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:51,639
what to call it it's not a tumbler

1213
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,920
because those ones are like the the

1214
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:54,519
barrel tumblers and they're super

1215
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,880
expensive but I got them both for under

1216
00:46:54,519 --> 00:47:00,199
the same price as locally a brand name

1217
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,358
sort of trimmer so that not offbrand

1218
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:04,879
sometimes is there but you're going to

1219
00:47:02,358 --> 00:47:08,960
have to deal with the quality so I did

1220
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:11,358
that and uh and and and listen that was

1221
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,639
that was the best deal that I do for for

1222
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:13,598
that because hand trimming wasn't

1223
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:17,159
possible

1224
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:19,880
now I get into well then drying well

1225
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:21,558
drying I I I I got these I I don't have

1226
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,079
space so when you don't have space you

1227
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:27,000
got to do what you got to do so you get

1228
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:29,160
those accordion um accordion like uh

1229
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,119
herb dryers off of Amazon is what they

1230
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:33,399
call them and they're just like you know

1231
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,559
10 inches wide they go down into a small

1232
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,480
thing that was the cheapest way I could

1233
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:39,359
store it and and still not have like

1234
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:42,519
half my basement full of the plants from

1235
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:46,598
the thing right so I did that and then

1236
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:49,039
um curing again into into reusable jars

1237
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:50,440
that I have and and sometimes I would we

1238
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:52,880
use it for peppers and stuff in the

1239
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:55,200
summer from our garden and I would reuse

1240
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,599
those um those Mason Jess buddi he's

1241
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:59,639
like it's going to taste like Peppers no

1242
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:01,800
it didn't we cleaned it out it was fine

1243
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:04,159
um and again just reuse the stuff that I

1244
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:07,800
have but

1245
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:10,199
recently I've switched my thinking on

1246
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:12,119
this so this is

1247
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:13,279
where it's going to people are going to

1248
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:15,519
be on the fence where this is indeed

1249
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:20,160
cheap or not and I can tell you to start

1250
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:23,838
off it wasn't cheap so uh I got into

1251
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:26,078
live rosin as my best way to consume my

1252
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:28,400
medicine why it's cleanest the tastiest

1253
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:31,559
it's whatever but to buy that from one

1254
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:35,559
of the uh Ontario stores here and man it

1255
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:37,960
was anywhere from $60 to $80 for one

1256
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:39,599
little small you know gram of this stuff

1257
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:42,480
so I decided you know what I'm going to

1258
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:45,400
do the process myself so I invested some

1259
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:49,679
money into a freeze dryer and this by

1260
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:52,760
far is not cheap it's about 4,000 bucks

1261
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:54,798
how can you say this is cheap well I

1262
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,480
then talked to my wife I had to talk her

1263
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:58,599
into letting me buy it first she didn't

1264
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:02,039
kick me out of the house cuz that was

1265
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:04,880
her first idea second idea was we're

1266
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:07,880
going to start a we and I say her

1267
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:09,000
because it was not we uh a freeze-dried

1268
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,798
candy

1269
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,119
business and I bought the the the the

1270
00:49:11,798 --> 00:49:16,318
freeze dryer it went to her business she

1271
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:20,039
now is going to write off that freeze

1272
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:22,400
dryer and um she has been selling

1273
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:24,599
freeze-dried candies and making a ton of

1274
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,559
money no it's worth it's effort it's

1275
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:29,200
whatever but that subsidized the cost of

1276
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:32,599
getting the freeze dryer so I can use it

1277
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:36,078
for my medicine and still be able to to

1278
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:38,280
to get it in there so again um write off

1279
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,318
of the machine great could have written

1280
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,519
off the machine as a as a as a process

1281
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:45,199
and doing content here on on you know

1282
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:46,880
the 420 things Channel but I couldn't

1283
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:49,000
have started any sort of business with

1284
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:52,000
it here in Canada so the the candy

1285
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,559
business man it's it's multi-purpose

1286
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,039
right you you get something for for one

1287
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:59,798
thing and use it for two others and

1288
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:02,960
you're saving money yes it's going to

1289
00:49:59,798 --> 00:50:06,440
cost you a little bit but man at $60 to

1290
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:09,199
$80 per unit I'm going to save money in

1291
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:13,318
the long run because I go through it

1292
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:16,639
quite fast so guess what $80 uh you know

1293
00:50:13,318 --> 00:50:18,039
every couple times it it adds up so uh

1294
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:19,519
at the first year of her business in the

1295
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:21,480
freeze dryer she looks like she's going

1296
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,159
to be able to make some money off of it

1297
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,639
whether we get into the red or green who

1298
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:28,279
knows but uh it's more than more than

1299
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:31,000
what we had so again it it it it it is

1300
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,640
that process but washing it with the ice

1301
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,798
and the water it's clean it's I I know

1302
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:38,000
what I'm getting so that's worth a

1303
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:41,079
little bit extra to me so again while

1304
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,838
it's not cheap sort of is cuz now it's

1305
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:44,720
paying for itself with the candy yeah

1306
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:47,119
I've been watching your stories on

1307
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:49,118
Instagram showing your updates on the

1308
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,440
freeze dried candy and that you went to

1309
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,240
your local farmers market or whatever

1310
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,240
and and selling them and stuff and it's

1311
00:50:53,239 --> 00:50:57,439
been really cool to kind of follow along

1312
00:50:55,239 --> 00:50:59,358
and see uh you know the progress you've

1313
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,280
been making there and seeing how you

1314
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:03,000
used it multi-purpose you know use it

1315
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,160
not just for freeze drying your own

1316
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,119
product but using it for candies as well

1317
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:09,039
on the sell I thought that was so cool

1318
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,358
yeah man it it is and we got into a

1319
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:12,920
couple stores now like we're like we had

1320
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:14,960
to get health inspected and all that

1321
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,880
stuff right so it's up like there is

1322
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,318
some process I had to pay for insurance

1323
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,960
and so there was extra cost on top of it

1324
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:24,960
where I go ah it's a little bit more but

1325
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,599
these again my wife is going out meeting

1326
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,480
people and talking to people and again

1327
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:31,200
getting out in the community man it is

1328
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,920
fun and again candy is is my kids love

1329
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:36,679
it and we can use fruit veget like ve

1330
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:39,519
like I'm going to uh all my all so we we

1331
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:41,399
have probably three rows of jalapenos we

1332
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:43,239
love jalapenos here so we always pickle

1333
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,798
them at the end of the year uh freeze

1334
00:51:43,239 --> 00:51:46,318
dryer now I'm not I'm not only going to

1335
00:51:44,798 --> 00:51:47,759
pickle I'm going to now I'm going to try

1336
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:49,239
to freeze dry jalapenos because

1337
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,319
apparently they come out once you freeze

1338
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:53,159
dry them bring them back out rehydrate

1339
00:51:51,318 --> 00:51:55,159
them they're just like new like right

1340
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:56,879
off of the stock so again I'm like wow

1341
00:51:55,159 --> 00:52:00,399
that's kind of cool another thing didn't

1342
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:02,039
know that so yeah again savings that's

1343
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,920
really cool getting back to harvest dry

1344
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:06,079
and cure one thing I want to mention is

1345
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,920
if you are looking to save money keep

1346
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:11,359
things cheap don't buy a

1347
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,798
krol now I have one of those it's super

1348
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:16,598
convenient it does automate things when

1349
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:18,798
it comes to the drying and and storage

1350
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:21,039
but uh they're very expensive you can

1351
00:52:18,798 --> 00:52:23,280
certainly get away with the drying

1352
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:25,440
process just using a tent for example or

1353
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,798
an open room some an open room a

1354
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,480
bathroom although I don't know there the

1355
00:52:27,798 --> 00:52:31,318
germs floating around in the bathroom

1356
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,318
not sure if you're using the bathroom as

1357
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:35,199
as you're trying in there but uh that

1358
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:38,000
might be a concern for some people but

1359
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:40,000
you can certainly just use a DIY I guess

1360
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,119
you can call it right little grow tent

1361
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,599
setup to where you're you've got a grow

1362
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:45,559
tent you've got your humidifier

1363
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,400
dehumidifier whatever you need and some

1364
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:50,040
air circulation and that's it you don't

1365
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:52,920
need to spend $1,600 on a Canon control

1366
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:55,358
now I have a unit myself I actually have

1367
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,599
two units now because I do like it and

1368
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:59,000
use it but if I were try to keep things

1369
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,480
cheap I would I would not have one of

1370
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,159
those I would not I would not buy one of

1371
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,318
those so and then for curing glass jars

1372
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:07,480
you mentioned it it's reuse them over

1373
00:53:05,318 --> 00:53:10,318
and over and over again well worth the

1374
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:12,838
investment in my opinion because it uh

1375
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:14,400
keeps things fresh some people are kind

1376
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:17,759
of split when it comes to having

1377
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,880
humidity packs in there or not but you

1378
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,599
can certainly store things for longer if

1379
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:24,240
you have those glass mason jars and

1380
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:26,240
you're reusing them as well so yeah and

1381
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:29,759
and you know what I I I don't know if

1382
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:31,959
you ever used those those bags that that

1383
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,319
they they came out not that long ago but

1384
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:36,358
the I think they're The Grove bags Grove

1385
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:39,558
bags yeah yeah yeah I've reused those a

1386
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:42,199
few times like it's the same bag over I

1387
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:44,440
don't I I didn't find it was as better

1388
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:46,318
like it didn't it it seemed the my

1389
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:49,079
medicine wasn't as good after the second

1390
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:50,679
or third time and and I'm like uh if I'm

1391
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:53,960
going to buy these I went back to the

1392
00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:56,239
jars when I was doing that right so but

1393
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:58,920
uh I don't did you ever you ever try

1394
00:53:56,239 --> 00:54:01,000
them ever tried reusing them yeah I've

1395
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:05,358
tried them they seem to work pretty good

1396
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:07,039
but I still like the jars really just to

1397
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:09,480
get things in and out of them you know

1398
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:12,400
opening of the bags is just I know it's

1399
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:15,559
not much of a difference in in removing

1400
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,200
product from a bag versus a jar but like

1401
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:19,200
it just feels more sturdy and things

1402
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:22,639
aren't kind of compacting against the

1403
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:25,358
buds as much and yes so I haven't been

1404
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:27,519
using the Grove bags anymore but I have

1405
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:30,400
used them in the past yeah no I didn't I

1406
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:32,280
just you're right kind of glass jars if

1407
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,960
you're curing that's that's whether

1408
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,000
they're big mason jars too like you can

1409
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,679
get some I I didn't when I first did it

1410
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,400
I had all these little small mason jars

1411
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:41,239
not small but I mean but there's some

1412
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,880
big old mason jars like you can get some

1413
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:45,759
big ones uh from different places seems

1414
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,720
like time of year or two to get them

1415
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,200
would be when they're on sale like right

1416
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:52,480
before like a a jarring season right

1417
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:53,960
like at at at Home Depot or Canadian

1418
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,519
Tire or whatever these places they'll

1419
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:58,480
they'll beat sales on those absolutely

1420
00:54:56,519 --> 00:55:00,639
what a conversation this was uh so good

1421
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,318
and TI flew by for this one for me at

1422
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:04,039
least it's uh I can't believe we're

1423
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:06,599
already at the hour mark so that that's

1424
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:07,960
wild let's wrap things up here though

1425
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:09,359
can you tell listeners how they can find

1426
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:12,838
you and what you have upcoming in the

1427
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:14,400
future sure sure yeah yeah yeah so uh I

1428
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:17,159
you you mentioned YouTube earlier

1429
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:20,079
youtube.com sl420

1430
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:22,038
things um that that's my channel um I

1431
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,160
did have more videos on there you know

1432
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:25,680
how YouTube is I got to a point where I

1433
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:30,960
had too many videos that were age

1434
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:32,598
restricted and I had a bigger um like I
