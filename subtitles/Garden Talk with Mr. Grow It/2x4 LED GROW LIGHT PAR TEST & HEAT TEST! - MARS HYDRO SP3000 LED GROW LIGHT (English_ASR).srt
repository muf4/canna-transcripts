1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,919
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,520
know me my name is chris aka mr growit

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,759
and you're watching my extras channel

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,399
mars hydro sent me over their sp

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,759
3000 led grill light and in this video i

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,519
am going to test the par

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,599
output and i'm also going to do a heat

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,640
test on it i actually already did

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,960
another video

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,199
where i unboxed the unit and i tested

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,439
two of them in a four by four grow tent

12
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,880
in this video i'm gonna test one in a

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,240
two by four grow tent

14
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,399
i'm not going to go over all of the grow

15
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,079
light specs but i will leave a link down

16
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,439
in the description section below so you

17
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,719
can click on that if you want to learn

18
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,159
more about the light

19
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,760
for the part test i'm going to use the

20
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:40,479
apogee mq620 extended range par meter

21
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,000
this meter measures from 340 nanometers

22
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,159
to 1040 nanometers

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,600
and the measurements are in ppfd i do

24
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,359
these part test videos just to give you

25
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,840
a general idea of what the power output

26
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,000
is

27
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,600
it's not going to be 100 accurate i take

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,799
measurements and grow tents that have

29
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,559
reflective walls

30
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,919
that could increase the numbers so just

31
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:56,878
keep that in mind i'm going to take

32
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,120
measurements at three different

33
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,679
distances 18 inches

34
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,519
24 inches and 30 inches and this light

35
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,799
does have a dimmer on it i'll set it to

36
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,560
100

37
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,240
i've plugged the led grow light into my

38
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,159
kilowatt meter and it shows

39
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,519
2.44 amps pulling 290 watts from the

40
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:27,740
wall

41
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:31,739
alright let's get into the measurements

42
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:34,339

just a reminder that there is a link to

79
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,240

81
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,720
