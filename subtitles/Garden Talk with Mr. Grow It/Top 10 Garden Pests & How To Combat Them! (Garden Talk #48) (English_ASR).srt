1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,839
coming up on garden talk if they're

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,759
unmated they produce males if they're

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,759
mated they'll produce females so it only

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,919
takes one female mite

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,839
for you to have an infestation so for a

6
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,638
lot of reasons brix doesn't really make

7
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:16,399
sense as a proxy for plant health

8
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,559
but it can be really helpful just to

9
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,399
gauge the photosynthetic rate

10
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,919
i would be very careful and cautious

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,358
because a lot of the medicinal

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,760
substances and things might be

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,480
associated with the flowering or perhaps

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,400
even the fruiting bodies i think that's

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,960
very useful to utilize things like

16
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,359
wettable sulfur not burn sulfur but

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,359
wettable sulfur have aphids and you see

18
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,200
these like worm-like organisms kind of

19
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,320
around them don't kill them because

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,840
they're not caterpillars they're

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,280
actually going to attack the aphids that

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,360
you're dealing with but you got to be

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,120
careful because if we over apply these

24
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,238
sorts of things we can run into

25
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,238
resistance issues

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,399

over the top 10 or at least we're going

to try to get through the top ten if not

89

that's okay but we're going to get

90

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,360
like to do first is introduction can you

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,280
tell us a little bit about yourself and

96
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,480
kind of how you got into gardening

97
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,919
absolutely

98
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,598
so my name is matthew gates

99
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,518
professionally at work is an ipm

100
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,598
specialist that stands for integrated

101
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,200
pest management

102
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,679
and i've been doing this for about 11

103
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,518
years it'll be 12 years in april of uh

104
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,439
this year actually

105
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,879
and i've been interested in growing

106
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,639
plants and

107
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,359
especially looking at insects and other

108
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,279
sorts of creepy crawlies as some people

109
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,959
would call them since i was a very young

110
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,598
child to be honest

111
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,920
and i've grown as a gardener since my

112
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:58,878
early teenage years when i

113
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,479
used to plant certain plants and and

114
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,959
in my parents house and that sort of a

115
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,759
thing and it was very foundational for

116
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,759
me and now i work in agriculture

117
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,120
that's awesome you also have a youtube

118
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,479
channel that i'm familiar with i'm

119
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,759
subscribed to it i'll definitely have

120
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,280
that link down in the youtube

121
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,280
description section below for those of

122
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,720
you that are tuning in on youtube but

123
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,120
for those that are on the podcast

124
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,120
platforms can you tell us what it is yes

125
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,199
absolutely so the name of the channel is

126
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,120
sentinel and the name of my consulting

127
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,400
group is xenthanol consulting so that's

128
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,959
the reason for that

129
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,959
and at that channel i like to talk about

130
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:34,239
various plant health topics usually

131
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:37,359
focus on pests in my pest primer series

132
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,319
where i go over very quickly a very uh

133
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,639
information dense packets of information

134
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,719
about various pests so

135
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,000
aphids and fungus gnats and things like

136
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,759
that how to treat them their physiology

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,360
strengths and weaknesses and other sorts

138
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,439
of cool details that will help you

139
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,040
succeed in treating them in a holistic

140
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:59,279
manner awesome cool well let's get right

141
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,600
into some of the common pests i want to

142
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,279
start with fungus gnats so this is

143
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,160
something i've battled many times in the

144
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,439
past

145
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,439
you know especially if you're growing

146
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,439
organically you know one of the key

147
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,199
things to do is to keep the medium moist

148
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,120
you know have those microbes working to

149
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,759
break down those amendments make them

150
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,240
available to the plant however fungus

151
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,720
nets thrive on that wet medium right

152
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,240
it's very true so they come through very

153
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,400
very often can you talk to us about

154
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,240
fungus gnats maybe you know what are

155
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,560
fungus gnats you know ways to battle

156
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,560
them etc etc

157
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,879
sure absolutely and you've hit the nail

158
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,478
on the head that is the major problem is

159
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,079
that on the one hand you need that

160
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,918
moisture in your substrate but at the

161
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,959
same time fungus gnats and other

162
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:42,159
organisms love that situation what's

163
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,000
good for the plants is good for the

164
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,960
pests as it turns out

165
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,959
so

166
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,038
i do tell people very often not just for

167
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,359
fungus gnats but other sorts of pests

168
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,120
especially if you have a mulch

169
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,038
that uh sometimes the best thing you can

170
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,519
do is actually kind of let things dry

171
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:00,399
out at the top layer and you know it's

172
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,159
sort of unfortunate it does sort of um

173
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,959
obviously will affect some level of

174
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,880
microbial diversity uh

175
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,279
and and of course your top soil dynamics

176
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,038
but um generally speaking if you kind of

177
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,478
have an overrun or over abundance of

178
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,079
them that's sometimes what you have to

179
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:15,439
do at least to get a little bit under

180
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,959
control

181
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,719
there are various products that you can

182
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,359
use as well and

183
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,600
my favorite way to go about it

184
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,319
if you're a home grower sometimes you

185
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,800
can acquire things like nematodes there

186
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,720
are a few different ones you can apply

187
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,240
i find that they work really well in my

188
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,560
personal experience not only in home

189
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,400
growing settings but also commercially

190
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,918
there's a few species steiner nema

191
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,839
felicia or sf is very commonly used

192
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,240
you could also use steiner nema

193
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,799
caprocapsi i believe it's was pronounced

194
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,960
which is like sc

195
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,840
but uh personally i just like to use the

196
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,758
sf nematodes or um an application of

197
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,000
buvari bastiana which is an

198
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,439
entomopathogenic fungus that's

199
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,759
commercially available but i think you

200
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,279
can also acquire it in other cases for

201
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,038
the home grower

202
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,799
and there are also botanical

203
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,959
insecticides that you can use that are

204
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,038
derived from plants like azidoractin

205
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:12,079
from neem or

206
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,439
pyrethrin from chrysanthemum

207
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,719
plants but you have to be a little bit

208
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,240
careful with that

209
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,400
generally speaking especially in a

210
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,120
homegrow setting you don't necessarily

211
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,719
know

212
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,800
and it's been my experience that some

213
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,400
plants will react totally fine

214
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,000
if you apply at the label rate or half

215
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,120
the label rate or whatever that is for

216
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,959
you

217
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,000
where you're growing and sometimes

218
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,918
plants are very susceptible or um for

219
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,360
whatever reason weak to it so you have

220
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,918
to be careful whenever you're using a

221
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,240
new product like that i always

222
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,120
caution that people apply it sort of at

223
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,519
a

224
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,160
lower rate just to see i usually have

225
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,318
the yellow sticky traps i put them by

226
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,080
the grill pot by soil level

227
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,919
then i can see if they if they have the

228
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,318
problem to begin with then from there

229
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,839
i'll do treatments now i've done neem

230
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,439
oil in the past which you mentioned

231
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,359
would like to know specifically what's

232
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,000
your recommendation for how often to

233
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,439
spray neem oil in regards to getting rid

234
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,439
of fungus dots

235
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,439
oh i always say when it comes to

236
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,560
application rates that's super important

237
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,240
and this will be true for all the pests

238
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,038
we talk about

239
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,478
to a crop scout and to to be very

240
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:15,680
vigilant and looking at your plans

241
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:16,959
because sometimes you can apply

242
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,280
something

243
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,279
and in one context you can be one and

244
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,279
done very rarely but it happens

245
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,519
sometimes or maybe two and done and you

246
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,598
can apply it like one day then wait a

247
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,000
day and take a look and then maybe apply

248
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,598
the next day or the day after that

249
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,120
but it's always going to be constantly

250
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,120
looking at

251
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,120
you know your status and your particular

252
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,120
pressure

253
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,038
with fungus gnats too you make a great

254
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,719
point about having the sticky cards it's

255
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,519
also really useful to sometimes have

256
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,839
them outside of your property

257
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,278
so that you can see what you acquire

258
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,959
outside and you can see what the

259
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,039
pressure is in the ambient location

260
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,559
sometimes you have something as simple

261
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,199
as a

262
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,039
leaky pipe or some other sort of thing

263
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,160
that creates a

264
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,159
a water dense zone of moisture

265
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,079
surrounding your area

266
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,679
maybe you live near a river or a stream

267
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,399
potentially and that could be a

268
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,239
potential sort of haven for these fungus

269
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,320
gnats and other pests and so then they

270
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,879
can ingress from that location so if

271
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,160
you're aware of your context outside as

272
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,559
only as

273
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,600
well as inside the cultivation space

274
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,599
then

275
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,000
i think that's a very useful information

276
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,560
and can help modulate how often you have

277
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,480
to apply and unfortunately in some cases

278
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,879
people just get them

279
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,800
like too often and it's because of their

280
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,120
locality rather than them doing anything

281
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,958
specifically wrong now how about

282
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,120
nematodes nematodes you mentioned that

283
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,278
was a way to combat them

284
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,560
i've never used them before what is the

285
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:49,039
typical application rate for them

286
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,599
uh so again it does really depend on

287
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:53,439
your pressure i would try to apply them

288
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,320
when you have a heavy amount it might

289
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,920
not be worth the economically and also

290
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,879
sort of the hassle especially as a home

291
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,319
grower

292
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,360
to apply them

293
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,560
unless you're applying them preps

294
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,200
regularly or if the crop that you're

295
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,278
growing is just sort of worth it for you

296
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,720
potentially there's a lot of factors to

297
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:12,320
consider but about

298
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,759
a lot of times these nematodes come in

299
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,920
quite large amounts you might even

300
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,759
purchase them in the in the built in the

301
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,399
yeah actually the millions and perhaps

302
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,078
you know multiple millions of nematodes

303
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,720
it's important to apply them usually

304
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,559
there's a there will be some sort of um

305
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,879
instructions you can always talk to the

306
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:31,119
the supplier to get better information

307
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,200
about their specific product

308
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,879
but it's usually very important to apply

309
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,040
them if you're watering them in with

310
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,879
some sort of agitation that's something

311
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:41,278
that people often

312
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,958
don't remember to do and so what happens

313
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,200
is that all the nematodes sort of stay

314
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,599
at the bottom and you're applying you're

315
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,879
watering it in maybe through some sort

316
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,560
of pump

317
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,799
and especially if you're using a nozzle

318
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,399
that has grading you will smash the

319
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,559
nematodes and they won't

320
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,159
they won't exist any longer if they go

321
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,000
through some sort of mesh grading so be

322
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,360
sure to those are the two perhaps

323
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,278
biggest things

324
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,200
that i see people make an error about

325
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:06,159
when it comes to fungus application or

326
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,560
rather

327
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,399
nematode application for fungus gnats

328
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,000
yeah so nematodes you know you can see

329
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,399
you can buy them off of amazon i've

330
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,839
heard mixed reviews off of them like

331
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,759
sometimes they show up dead or something

332
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,680
like that do you have like a source that

333
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,000
you can recommend for nematodes

334
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,199
absolutely there are a lot of biocontrol

335
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,039
companies

336
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,839
that and i always i always say this so

337
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:30,000
i'll keep it very brief

338
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,560
essentially there are primary producers

339
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,480
and there are tertiary producers and

340
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,479
generally you don't want to buy from

341
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,839
tertiary producers because the product

342
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,680
is usually

343
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,160
not up to snuff for various reasons

344
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,679
either because they got the bio controls

345
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,360
and they've kind of kept them in this

346
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,120
sort of

347
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,440
you know staging

348
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,200
system where they're not really the

349
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,800
freshest that they could be so that can

350
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,200
be a problem of course you might get

351
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,879
something second hand if you go tertiary

352
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,240
but from primary producers there are

353
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,720
several

354
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,519
copper biological systems is a big one

355
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,959
beneficial insectary is a big one

356
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,240
and if they don't have the nematodes

357
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,319
themselves

358
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,959
for whatever reason maybe supplies

359
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,560
they'll definitely know a source for you

360
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:15,278
and usually these places are very

361
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,119
professional and are willing to

362
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,879
sort of point you in the right direction

363
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,240
okay and then one last thing which we

364
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,320
probably should have gone over in the

365
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,079
beginning is is understanding the life

366
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,160
cycle a little bit better you know if

367
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:27,759
you have a population of fungus gnats

368
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,958
you could deal with sticky cards maybe

369
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:30,240
you're spraying neem and all of a sudden

370
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,039
they're gone

371
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,720
well they've laid eggs you know in the

372
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,719
medium right so like you could have a

373
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,320
whole new population happen after a

374
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,360
little while right so what is kind of

375
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,200
the the life cycle of a fungus gnat

376
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,959
there are many kinds of fungus gnats a

377
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,040
lot of people interact with the dark

378
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,919
winged fungus gnats which is the

379
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,599
prodigia genus

380
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,439
and you can tell them they're very often

381
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,360
control confused for like aphids

382
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,920
especially like rice root aphids and

383
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,399
things like this so um they're very thin

384
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,799
bodied uh they like to walk and they're

385
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,720
very nimble when they walk across

386
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,159
like a substrate for example like your

387
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,000
soil

388
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:09,519
that's what the adults look like they're

389
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,278
kind of thin

390
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,120
tiny flies

391
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:14,879
not very substantial they don't they

392
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,759
don't approach anywhere near the size of

393
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,000
like a house fly for example um again

394
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,919
they're very dainty but the fungus

395
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,919
larvae themselves can be told from other

396
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,159
sort of worm-like organisms because they

397
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,679
have a white cream-colored body

398
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,600
sometimes you can see the gray

399
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,919
intestinal tract

400
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,920
and they'll have a black capsule

401
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,120
head which is very important because

402
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,919
other

403
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,278
fly larvae may lack this entirely so you

404
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,240
can definitely tell them from other

405
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,759
things

406
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,639
they're part of different groups so like

407
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:48,000
a white colored larva that can get about

408
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,159
um you know a few millimeters long

409
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,759
and it oftentimes they can also produce

410
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,120
sort of a mucus

411
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,039
so

412
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,879
if you have a large population of them

413
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,639
or if you have a population especially

414
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,799
after you've dried they can use that

415
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,720
mucus and create kind of like a

416
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,479
like a tunnel that can be shelter for

417
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,920
them when it gets drier as well so

418
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,000
that's one reason why drying might not

419
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,399
be enough and you have to go in

420
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,519
with some sort of a product

421
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,000
additionally you could use something

422
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,159
like a bacillus product but specifically

423
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,078
something like israelinsis bacillus

424
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,958
subchilis or sorry bacillus

425
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:23,439
thuringiensis israelensis which i will

426
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,879
be happy to talk about or spell for

427
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,279
anyone who needs it

428
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:30,078
but that's the particular fly

429
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,838
uh associated subtype for that uh

430
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,838
species of bacteria

431
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,560
gotcha okay that's some good information

432
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,360
for sure let's move on to spider mites

433
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,719
so another thing that's very very common

434
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,039
in the grow realm

435
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,879
you know indoors outdoors talk to us

436
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,719
about spider mites what are spider mites

437
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,198
maybe talk about their life cycle of

438
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,759
spider mites and how to battle them

439
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:54,078
so absolutely so spider mites i love to

440
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:56,480
talk about because they're

441
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:59,838
they're amazingly adaptive they feed on

442
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,079
over 13 000 or 1300 rather plants out

443
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,320
there that are documented

444
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:07,039
they do this really well because

445
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,160
much of their genome is actually

446
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:12,879
associated with detoxification and plant

447
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:15,120
immune system suppression genes

448
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,958
so when they go to feed on the plant

449
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,120
they will feed on the individual cell

450
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,879
contents with their stylet and when they

451
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,480
do that they produce a saliva that

452
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:27,439
suppresses the immune response locally

453
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,199
and they also are able to detoxify like

454
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,839
toxins and things that the plant

455
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:32,719
produces that could be poisonous for it

456
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,160
and

457
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,959
spider mites

458
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,198
are

459
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,439
haplodiploid which is just a fancy way

460
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:42,000
of saying that the females if they're

461
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,759
mated will produce males

462
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,278
or rather if they're unmated they

463
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,360
produce males if they're mated they'll

464
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,720
produce females so it only takes one

465
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,199
female mite

466
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,160
for you to have an infestation

467
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,559
they will

468
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,399
when populations get very large

469
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,319
they tend to produce a more dense

470
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,078
webbing they'll produce small amounts of

471
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,399
webbing when they're a small colony and

472
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,319
they produce round circular eggs and

473
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,320
they have a red color and they often

474
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,399
have this sort of two spotting which is

475
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,959
actually their intestinal pouches but if

476
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,000
they haven't fed very much yet or if

477
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,758
they're a particular subtype like the um

478
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,278
uh the red form that's just bright

479
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,039
cinnabar color

480
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,480
um then you might think oh it doesn't

481
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,799
have the two spots that might not be the

482
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,959
two spot spider-man but indeed they come

483
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:27,278
in several different colors like green

484
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:30,078
or whitish or reddish or orangish so you

485
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,278
just have to be vigilant

486
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,039
but what happens is that when the

487
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,439
population gets high

488
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:37,278
they will sort of aggregate at the top

489
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,680
of the plant and they will try to use

490
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:42,879
silk in order to

491
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,679
catch the air like baby spiders often do

492
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,000
and

493
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,000
move a short distance or sometimes in

494
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,440
some cases oh quite a long distance on

495
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,360
air currents and this is actually a

496
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,279
common thing with a lot of

497
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,919
arachnids and insects

498
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,838
gotcha and then they lay their eggs

499
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,519
underneath the leaf right on the bottom

500
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,680
part of the leaf so

501
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,919
you know oftentimes a general practice

502
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,078
is to inspect the leaves on a daily

503
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,678
basis you know and looking the underside

504
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,279
of the leaves these are small enough to

505
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,439
where you're going to need a little

506
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,798
handheld microscope right

507
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,038
i would say that you can usually see

508
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,798
them visibly with your eyes naked

509
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,959
but it definitely can help you

510
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:22,240
especially if maybe your eyesight's a

511
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,600
little bit uh one for wear or

512
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,120
if you're in a situation where because

513
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,558
sometimes they don't move that often

514
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,199
when they're feeding so it can be a

515
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,798
little bit difficult but as you say

516
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,640
not only spider mites but many other

517
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:35,038
insects that feed on leaves and or

518
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,360
rather mites and arthropods you can find

519
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,440
them on the underside of leaves and

520
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,558
there's a variety of reasons for that it

521
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,640
evades

522
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,279
predation but also

523
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,120
the harmful uv rays from

524
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:48,879
the natural environment is usually not

525
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,319
great for them either so

526
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,520
it's a great way for them to get both

527
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:55,279
benefits in regards to combating them

528
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,279
spraying a lot of people like to use

529
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,960
sprays to combat them you know whether

530
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,720
it be in veg sometimes when you get up

531
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,798
to flower people don't want to spray at

532
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,798
all do you have any recommendations for

533
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,639
sprays they should use and like how

534
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,160
often i know we talked about application

535
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,160
rates a little bit but can you give us a

536
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,919
little bit of of background on the

537
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,600
sprays that can be used

538
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,759
absolutely so

539
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,918
i think that it's very useful to utilize

540
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,319
things like wettable sulfur not burn

541
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,720
sulfur but wettable sulfur

542
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:25,279
granules that you can apply it's really

543
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,038
great with plants that don't have some

544
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,558
sort of a

545
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:30,000
like if they have delicate flowers that

546
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,558
you're trying to

547
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
uh you know so avoid damaging sometimes

548
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:35,839
you can use this and you won't have a

549
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,839
problem as much as you have with some

550
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,759
harsh chemistry potentially or harsher

551
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:40,879
chemistry but it really is plant

552
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:42,558
dependent

553
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,520
it's great if the plants are in some

554
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,879
sort of a non-floral reproductive stage

555
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:48,879
because

556
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,480
those tissues can be a little bit

557
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,600
like i said delicate

558
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,038
and if you apply um to like a house

559
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,279
plant or something like that you can get

560
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,839
good coverage pretty easily and this

561
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,918
sulfur is also going to be really well

562
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,599
to do against not just spider mites but

563
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,440
other sorts of insects that we'll talk

564
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,519
about later so i like to use that

565
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,240
because it's very cheap very affordable

566
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:13,918
you can get it in most places so that

567
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,319
makes it a very ideal thing to apply

568
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,559
you can also use other chemistries as

569
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,879
well but for the most part i find that

570
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,639
to be a pretty useful one to utilize

571
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,960
that you can have access to that's

572
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,679
non-commercial at least is it safe to

573
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,480
spray on flowers too or no it depends on

574
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,240
the flower we're talking about um

575
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,519
in my experience

576
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,000
even in commercial settings with

577
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,679
ornamental plants uh wetable sulfur

578
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,960
worked pretty fine as long as we didn't

579
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,640
get too randy with the um

580
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,440
with the level

581
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,600
we even sprayed it on gerber daisies

582
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,320
lilies roses

583
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:52,959
we didn't have a problem really

584
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:53,759
some spray roses maybe if they're very

585
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,558
young

586
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,480
uh could be negatively affected okay and

587
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,558
then medicinal varieties

588
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,319
um i wouldn't apply it i would be very

589
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,319
careful and cautious because a lot of

590
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,480
the medicinal substances and things

591
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:10,399
might be associated with the flowering

592
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,480
or perhaps even the fruiting bodies and

593
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,120
i would just try to keep that

594
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,000
exposure to a minimum okay and then one

595
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:20,000
last thing environment for spider mites

596
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,079
i've heard they thrive and

597
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,919
correct me from wrong warmer conditions

598
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,519
would it make sense to

599
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,840
potentially if you if you have a spider

600
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:30,480
mite infestation to lower the temps

601
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:32,720
temporarily to try to reduce the you

602
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,319
know reproduction or anything like that

603
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,038
that's a good point i've had people ask

604
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,960
me that several times um i think that

605
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,720
generally you probably don't get too

606
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,720
much of a benefit out of it especially

607
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,798
for using some sort of an application

608
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,480
very quickly but you're absolutely right

609
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:49,440
that they are associated with higher

610
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,519
temperatures and

611
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,080
to that end you bring up a really great

612
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:58,720
point because if you track your pests

613
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:00,240
and i recommend people do this

614
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,159
they can kind of find you can find

615
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,319
patterns that maybe you get spider mites

616
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,039
generally on the onset of like late

617
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,960
spring early summer where it gets hot

618
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:11,679
and so if you know that already you can

619
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,558
kind of get yourself ready for that

620
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,519
potential ingress seasonally and that

621
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,279
can be very very useful in my experience

622
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,440
let's move on to aphids

623
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:23,038
so i have battle aphids particularly my

624
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,960
outdoor garden i was growing in my

625
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,440
vegetable garden i had some

626
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,480
some beautiful lettuce some kale and

627
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,080
then my bok choy and the aphids liked

628
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,319
the bok choy and i don't know if it was

629
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,678
because the bok choy was

630
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:36,960
starting to get deficiencies or

631
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,360
something i know

632
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,640
generally speaking if a plant is

633
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,119
weakened it's going through some sort of

634
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,600
deficiencies it's more prone to getting

635
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,759
pests but uh my bok choy was just it was

636
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:50,399
loaded with aphids i mean they were

637
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,319
burrowed like deep inside the leaves and

638
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,480
this was going to harvest you know and i

639
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:57,119
was like what the heck anyways

640
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,038
i've had a bad past experience with them

641
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:01,918
talk to episode aphids what are they

642
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,919
what's their life cycle etc etc so

643
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,679
aphids are very complicated to talk

644
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,799
about they have a sort of an interesting

645
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:11,038
life cycle for a lot of them

646
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:13,279
they tend to be very host specific so

647
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,919
they'll only feed on one or a few

648
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,279
related species or they sometimes are

649
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,038
very generalistic and they'll feed on

650
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,798
tons of different ones the peach is a

651
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:23,200
good example

652
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:25,279
of the latter

653
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,200
and i can totally visualize what you're

654
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,599
talking about a lot of times because

655
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,440
they're clonal so aphids are generally

656
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,399
female there are sometimes males but

657
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,120
usually

658
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,519
colonies are clonal females with a live

659
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,759
birth clonal offspring in fact aphids

660
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:42,639
are born not just mothers but

661
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:44,158
grandmothers believe it or not

662
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,559
so that's that owes to their

663
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,039
reproductive capacity

664
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,319
they produce tons of

665
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,400
of a young

666
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:55,839
and that's the key to their ability to

667
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,600
survive so well and so those clonal

668
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:59,678
populations they'll just keep

669
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,918
reproducing and reproducing on a plant

670
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,280
and if the plant starts to sin nas or

671
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,200
like you mentioned they might get some

672
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,119
sort of nutrient deficiency they can

673
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,200
taste that essentially when they're

674
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,038
feeding and that might stimulate in

675
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,798
addition to like

676
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:14,640
sort of weather patterns changing or

677
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,200
other sorts of things like that that can

678
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,840
stimulate them to create a second adult

679
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,960
form that has wings and that winged form

680
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:24,158
is meant to disperse to other plants

681
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,919
and some

682
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,159
some aphids this

683
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,720
they require an alternative host so

684
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,360
they'll feed on like weedy plants or

685
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,079
herbaceous plants on one in some seasons

686
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:39,519
and then they'll switch to like woodier

687
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:42,240
tree-like plants in another case so

688
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,879
not all aphids do this but that is

689
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,038
one other kind of lifestyle and when

690
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,240
they create the winged forms in that

691
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:49,759
case they might be going to that

692
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,679
alternative host or they're just trying

693
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,919
to seek another host

694
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,480
to go to because the colony is probably

695
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,400
well developed at that point

696
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,319
so that's their life cycle essentially

697
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,679
and there's many things you can use to

698
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:03,278
affect them

699
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,200
we talked about spider mites earlier i

700
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:06,640
just want to say that

701
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,798
you're going to get bio controls for

702
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,960
them as well like for the spider mites

703
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:13,440
persimilis is really good

704
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,360
i've often recommended them

705
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,320
quite a bit for aphids you can use

706
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,439
things like

707
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:21,839
affinious wasps as well aphidis irvine

708
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,880
aphidius metricarii are really common to

709
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:26,959
use and they parasitize the aphids you

710
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,640
can also get the um

711
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,798
aphidolides aphidamiza which is a midge

712
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,960
the larvae of which will feed on aphids

713
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,359
and if you're a home grower you should

714
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,840
watch out for things called hoverflies

715
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:42,479
or surfadi so the surface family are

716
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,959
these bright almost wasp-like colored

717
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,278
hoverflies oftentimes and they're called

718
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,200
hoverflies or flower flies because the

719
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,798
adults kind of like a hummingbird can

720
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,319
hover in one place

721
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:54,079
and

722
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:56,240
you can sometimes find these larvae that

723
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,558
can kind of look like caterpillars

724
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,200
um kind of bounding up and down your

725
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,240
plants looking for aphids to feed on

726
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,519
and

727
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,440
one of the things that i have on my

728
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:08,079
youtube channel are observational

729
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,798
footage and clips of hoverflies and

730
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,158
beneficial insects and pests as well so

731
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:13,519
if you're curious about what they can

732
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,679
look like you can check them out on the

733
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:19,839
youtube channel but

734
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:21,360
it's very important if you see a colony

735
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:24,000
of aphids and you see these like

736
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,359
worm-like organisms kind of around them

737
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,720
don't kill them because they're not

738
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,240
caterpillars they're actually going to

739
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,600
attack the aphids that you're dealing

740
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,359
with

741
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,719
so that's an important thing that i like

742
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:34,558
to talk about

743
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,558
that's good to know and then one more

744
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:39,278
follow-up question in regards to you

745
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:41,359
know plant being deficient and a pest

746
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,440
being more prone to attack now i've

747
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:45,599
heard talking about bricks i don't know

748
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,600
how familiar you are with brix levels

749
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,000
but from what is said

750
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,319
very often is that if your brix level is

751
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,319
above 12

752
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,038
you're pretty much invisible to pests is

753
00:25:54,319 --> 00:26:00,000
that true or is that bro science that's

754
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:01,679
never been my experience and the i have

755
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
actually made several videos about this

756
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,519
topic it's very pernicious

757
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,038
um

758
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,960
basically so bricks has to do with not a

759
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:12,798
lot of times people simplify to sugar

760
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,278
content and a lot of times people are

761
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:17,119
looking for sugar content specifically

762
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:18,640
the photosynthate right

763
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,959
and

764
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,759
i like to say like this bricks can't not

765
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,558
be

766
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:26,319
useful it has to be helpful to the plant

767
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:27,678
that the photosynthetic is incredibly

768
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:29,359
important for

769
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,440
um

770
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:32,719
the basic powering of its metabolism

771
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,038
right

772
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,038
so that's it cannot not be helpful but

773
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:40,798
insects and other things have

774
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,480
great ways of feeding on plants and the

775
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:45,038
sugars inside and also the other

776
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,079
constituents in the phloem brix levels

777
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:50,000
also change rapidly especially if we're

778
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:51,918
dealing with uh most plants that people

779
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,038
are dealing with that photosynthesized

780
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,720
way

781
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:56,640
they photosynthesize during the day and

782
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,480
then all those processes kind of shut

783
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,159
off during night time not all plants do

784
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,120
this but a lot of them do

785
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,880
and

786
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,839
in that case you're getting brix levels

787
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,400
that are not

788
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,319
the same consistently so for a lot of

789
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,798
reasons bricks doesn't really make sense

790
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,720
as a proxy for plant health

791
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:15,278
but it can be really helpful just to

792
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,960
gauge the photosynthetic rate

793
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:19,519
of the plant

794
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,600
and to that matter aphids and many other

795
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:25,359
insects have tons of enzymes and

796
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,558
detoxification genes and things related

797
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:29,119
to

798
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:31,519
suppressing plant immune response and

799
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:34,558
suppressing or detoxifying compounds and

800
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:37,278
aphids are particularly good at this

801
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:40,079
in my video about aphid physiology and

802
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:41,359
why aphids can eat healthy plants

803
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:42,720
i go over

804
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,959
with research from an insect

805
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,558
physiologist

806
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,640
that talks about how they were able to

807
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:52,000
get aphids to feed on

808
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,840
sugar sources of 34 bricks

809
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,119
which is pretty massive

810
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,599
and

811
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:58,639
they were also able to

812
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:00,719
target

813
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,799
sorry they're able to target the rate at

814
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,798
which when they increased the bricks

815
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:09,278
that how the aphids were able to

816
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:09,278
basically

817
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:14,000
degrade the sugars that they were

818
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:15,359
feeding on

819
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,839
and

820
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,278
deal with them totally so as they moved

821
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,000
from

822
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:24,079
one mega pascal to four megapascals of

823
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,599
pressure which is actually massive when

824
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,398
you think about how small these insects

825
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,519
are

826
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:31,439
the sugars were so concentrated

827
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:34,079
um you could you could say that four

828
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,798
megapacks pascals is about the pressure

829
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,960
that a paintball marker makes you know

830
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:41,119
when it's propelling a paintball

831
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,960
so pretty pretty big

832
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,879
and the enzymes that were able to break

833
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,200
down those sugars with no problem and

834
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,399
then they excrete them as honeydew so oh

835
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,319
that's another thing we should probably

836
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:51,918
talk about a great way to find if you

837
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:54,158
have aphids is if you see these the

838
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,080
sticky substance on the leaves of your

839
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,159
plants you can look up from those leaves

840
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:00,398
and you can often find aphids and

841
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,840
sometimes that honeydew is colonized

842
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:04,319
with

843
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:06,558
a a fungus

844
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:09,119
called city mold it's not directly

845
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,639
pathogenic to the plant but it does grow

846
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,000
on the honeydew and it can make the

847
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,880
plants

848
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,240
not

849
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,080
cosmetically

850
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,599
viable for example

851
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,519
that's interesting definitely some

852
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,839
useful information there

853
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,599
let's move on to thrips can you talk to

854
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:25,519
us about drips what are thrips and what

855
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,038
are their life cycle it's great that you

856
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,519
mentioned thrips right after aphids

857
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:33,200
believe it or not they're very closely

858
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:36,158
related um the two orders of hemitara

859
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,080
and thiasinoptera a long time ago they

860
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,120
diverted and

861
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,519
they have a lot of similar

862
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:44,000
characteristics

863
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:44,720
uh thrips are

864
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,519
uh

865
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,960
there's over 5000 species of thrips but

866
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,639
a very small percentage of them are

867
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,840
actually pest

868
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,759
species

869
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:54,558
and the one that most people are dealing

870
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,640
with

871
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,398
are western flower thrips there's also

872
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,080
other ones like chili thrips and onion

873
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,918
thrips which are also very common to

874
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,759
deal with but i think western flower

875
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,000
thrips is is the most

876
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:09,119
documented for sure and most research

877
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,798
actually concerns western flower thrips

878
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:13,038
as they

879
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,960
reproduce essentially

880
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:16,079
some thrifts don't do this but a lot of

881
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,840
thrips will

882
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,480
and western flower tips in particular

883
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:22,959
will actually put their eggs inside the

884
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,599
plant tissue so you can run into a

885
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,200
situation where somebody maybe is a

886
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:28,879
nursery and they spray their plants so

887
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,600
they do whatever

888
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,440
with the contact spray or bio controls

889
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,678
and they're thinking oh no thrips it's

890
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,080
fine they sell to somebody and thrips

891
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,440
are coming out of the tissues little

892
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,639
baby

893
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,399
yeah nymphs and those nymphs come out

894
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,240
they feed on the plant tissues and they

895
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,558
create this sort of silvering or

896
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,480
scarring damage

897
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:52,158
from their feeding and you can usually

898
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,399
tell strips from other pests not only

899
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,840
because they have this like thin

900
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:57,359
kind of like

901
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:59,038
cigar shape

902
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,798
uh especially as nymphs but also as

903
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,319
adults they have these feathery wings so

904
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:04,720
if you're scoping them you can kind of

905
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,960
see them they have a very um very

906
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,558
specific kind of look to them this sort

907
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,720
of thin look and that allows them to get

908
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:13,200
into crevices really easily they can

909
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,960
often feed on pollen as well

910
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,640
so if your plant feeds or creates

911
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,480
copious amounts of pollen then that can

912
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,038
be also a big food source for them and

913
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,839
especially the females to reproduce

914
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:23,440
and

915
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,079
but as the nymphs

916
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,240
feed they will turn into pupae and those

917
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:29,599
pupae will often fall to the ground

918
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,519
which is why

919
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:34,000
a comprehensive treatment for thrips

920
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,159
often include something in the soil

921
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,839
either a bio control or some sort of a

922
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,840
spray application so that you can get

923
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:41,759
them or onto the ground itself if you're

924
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,639
growing inside

925
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:47,038
because whether in a greenhouse or in

926
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,679
just like a home grow situation

927
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,599
the floor can also be a residual place

928
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,240
for various pests but especially these

929
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:56,959
puffy and then over time this pupae will

930
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,359
develop and adults will come out and uh

931
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,519
they're very very vaginal they'll

932
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,959
they'll fly all over the place and

933
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,278
they're really great at getting into

934
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,399
places um many research reports have

935
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:07,759
been

936
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:10,079
produced

937
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,440
simply describing how good thrips are

938
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,439
and evading

939
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,558
destruction and getting into new places

940
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,880
so

941
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:19,519
don't feel too bad if you get a thrips

942
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,360
uh ingress into your location because

943
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,359
they're everywhere basically so what are

944
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,519
some of the sprays that you can use or

945
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:27,519
ways to combat thrips

946
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,399
my favorite way to combat thrips is

947
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,798
actually using predatory mites and

948
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:35,839
maintaining a population at a certain

949
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:37,440
level inside your homegrow space

950
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:38,959
this actually works out really well for

951
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,960
other mites that are especially those

952
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,720
you're able to

953
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,798
maintain on some sort of alternative

954
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,960
food source so like a feeder mite for

955
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:49,679
example swirsky

956
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,120
or cucumber smites are preferred for

957
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,038
this they'll also feed on other things

958
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:56,000
like white flies or

959
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:58,158
sometimes moth eggs for example

960
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,759
as well as

961
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,679
recit mice and broad mites and things

962
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,278
like this so you can get kind of a

963
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,200
generalized

964
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:07,119
protection from having that population

965
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,798
there but in addition to that you can

966
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:11,278
also use things like the wettable sulfur

967
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:14,319
i mentioned many thrips have actually

968
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:15,919
developed quite a robust resistance to

969
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:17,439
some of even the harsher chemistries

970
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,799
that i wouldn't advocate for people to

971
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,120
utilize

972
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:23,200
sort of systemic pesticides and things

973
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,798
like this

974
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,120
and then the resistance makes it even

975
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,879
less of a viable choice

976
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:30,719
but the acid reaction and the pyrethrin

977
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,960
i mentioned which is pretty common and a

978
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,880
lot of people like to use i find often

979
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,880
does work as well but you got to be

980
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,640
careful because if we over apply these

981
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,799
sorts of things we can run into

982
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,880
resistance issues

983
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:45,440
okay gotcha

984
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,640
let's move on to white flies so i've

985
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,399
actually had a couple flying around in

986
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,000
my grover on my indoor grill realm

987
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:51,759
killed them off and that was it it was

988
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,119
kind of strange didn't last very long

989
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:54,480
but talk to us about white flies you

990
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,119
know what are they what's their life

991
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,120
cycle so on and so forth so white flies

992
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,119
are really interesting because um

993
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:03,278
there's several different kinds uh a lot

994
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:06,000
of people deal with the so-called silver

995
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:07,119
leaf wi-fi bemisia tabassi but there's

996
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,320
also

997
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:13,199
um the greenhouse wi-fi this is a trail

998
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,440
trial ludiz or whatever and there's a

999
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,118
couple of others out there even a black

1000
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,599
white clay which is a white flag it's

1001
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,399
colored black and

1002
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,800
these

1003
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:26,398
they as nymphs they actually look like

1004
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:30,000
little scale insects little um

1005
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:31,918
kind of sessile just like clumps um on

1006
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,519
your plant on your leaves or on your

1007
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,480
stems potentially but usually on the

1008
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,119
leaves

1009
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,639
and as they develop at least with the

1010
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,240
silver leaf whitefly you can start to

1011
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,960
see little eyes

1012
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,878
on the on the nymph and they pupate and

1013
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,240
then adults will come out of them adults

1014
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:51,358
are usually white with sort of a waxy uh

1015
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:53,519
covering on their on their bodies

1016
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,119
and uh i guess they're colored white

1017
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:56,719
right and so they will feed in the same

1018
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,280
place where their nymphs are and usually

1019
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,039
they like to aggregate as a colony and

1020
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,599
they often find that they're they're

1021
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:05,358
they're they work the best i think

1022
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,200
in places where the foliage is like

1023
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,039
denser and there's a lot less light

1024
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,039
penetration i find that that's pretty

1025
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:12,960
common in a lot of plants

1026
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:14,239
and there's many ways you can combat

1027
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,320
them

1028
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:18,239
a lot of the sprays that i've already

1029
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,800
mentioned before work really well i

1030
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:23,519
actually cut my teeth on using buberi

1031
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,560
basiana against white flies to

1032
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:29,119
great great effect because they tend to

1033
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:31,519
stay together like they do so the fungus

1034
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,160
when you spray it the spores germinate

1035
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:36,239
on the body penetrate the cuticle kill

1036
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:38,960
them from the inside out and then they

1037
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:40,479
just move on to the very next one

1038
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,559
it's actually a terrible way to go out

1039
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,639
if you ask me but it's very highly

1040
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:46,639
effective

1041
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,719
i should also mention that specifically

1042
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:52,078
for the silver leaf whitefly

1043
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:54,559
it's a super vector of over 480 plant

1044
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,839
viruses and although aphids tend to be

1045
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:59,920
the supreme plant virus vector white

1046
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:01,679
flies are probably

1047
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,920
right up there especially this species

1048
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:06,480
so if you grow plants like beets or

1049
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,400
peppers or tomatoes or things like that

1050
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,599
just be aware that sometimes you might

1051
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,358
get a pathogen like a virus

1052
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,200
and that could be very lethal to your

1053
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:16,799
plant as well so just be careful with

1054
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:18,559
them but like you've actually mentioned

1055
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,160
i find white flies are pretty easy to

1056
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,320
deal with to be honest

1057
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:24,480
yeah you mentioned you know viruses we

1058
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,280
talked about before this how an episode

1059
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,440
on a complete episode on viroids viruses

1060
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,280
funguses stuff like that would be a good

1061
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,280
one so maybe in the future we can do a

1062
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,599
part two we get into detail on those

1063
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,119
things because i agree with you there's

1064
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,039
a lot of information to be said about

1065
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,440
that and i think that there's a lot of

1066
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:43,759
things that people don't know about that

1067
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,519
you know and how easy it is to transfer

1068
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,040
viruses for example from plant to plant

1069
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:48,880
so maybe in the future we can do a part

1070
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,599
two one more thing that i want to ask

1071
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,838
would be are white flies attracted to

1072
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,359
the yellow stickies like other flies

1073
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:57,358
typically are

1074
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:59,279
absolutely in fact

1075
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:01,598
one of the viruses that we were that was

1076
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,320
mentioning earlier

1077
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,559
it

1078
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,039
destroys parts of its brain the white

1079
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:08,480
fly in order to allow it to not have a

1080
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,199
preference for yellow

1081
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,440
which allows the virus to likely go to a

1082
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:15,519
green plant that is not infected so

1083
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,559
believe it or not that's pretty amazing

1084
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:19,358
so

1085
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:22,239
yes in fact white flies do prefer

1086
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:23,838
like a lot of insects the yellow color

1087
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:26,719
because it's usually a sign of

1088
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:29,119
senescence or nutrient deficiency or

1089
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:31,118
some sort of a problem maybe a pathogen

1090
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,039
and that will make the plant an easier

1091
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,599
host that's awesome yeah i didn't know

1092
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,960
that okay how about next we go into

1093
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,240
russet mites

1094
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,599
talk to us about russell's mites you

1095
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,759
want to let us know you know what they

1096
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,519
are their life cycle i heard they're a

1097
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,680
beast to battle

1098
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,599
they really are and in uh there are

1099
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:48,879
several arrested mites in fact most

1100
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,400
recitamites

1101
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,000
if you look at the entire group and

1102
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,119
they're not very well documented to be

1103
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,639
honest but

1104
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,039
a lot of rasta mites are actually not

1105
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:59,440
passed to their hosts

1106
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:02,239
most recitamites out in nature

1107
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,440
i wish there are many thousands

1108
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,759
it actually don't cause a lot of

1109
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,440
problems but those that we do know

1110
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,760
they're sometimes called blister mites

1111
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,880
because they can produce like a gall in

1112
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,400
the plant

1113
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,400
uh a lot of different wrist mites have

1114
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,680
this effect on various trees

1115
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,400
uh but uh russet mice that we find in

1116
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:23,759
crop protection agriculture like aloe

1117
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,838
recitamite or citrus recitamite or

1118
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,760
other kinds of russet mites those are a

1119
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:30,320
problem

1120
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,160
because they are very very very damaging

1121
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,160
to the host and in a lot of cases

1122
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:37,279
honestly sometimes the best thing you

1123
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:40,239
can do is actually call a couple of the

1124
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,160
plants if they are very heavily infested

1125
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:44,559
so like very carefully taking them out

1126
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:46,319
of whatever your setup is and putting

1127
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:48,480
them in a bag tying off the bag and

1128
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,559
throwing it away um

1129
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,639
breast mites are typically specialists

1130
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,639
so they don't typically feed on other

1131
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:56,559
plants of of a different species or

1132
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:58,480
genus or family

1133
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:01,119
so like for example if you have tomato

1134
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,639
recipe it's very unlikely

1135
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,920
pretty much not going to happen that

1136
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:05,920
that restaurant is going to feed on

1137
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,000
something like aloe or citrus like i

1138
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,079
mentioned before

1139
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,639
it's also a rosebud mite for that matter

1140
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,359
that transmits a virus that i actually

1141
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:17,519
had the ignoble experience of having to

1142
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:19,440
deal with um

1143
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:21,599
we bought all these new roses at an

1144
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,320
ornamental grow that i worked with

1145
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,880
and those roses all came from a nursery

1146
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,480
that just got done being shut down for

1147
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,240
like a year and a half cleaning

1148
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,320
everything getting rid of everything

1149
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:34,159
because they had this virus that's

1150
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,079
vectored by the russet

1151
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:38,559
and then that rest of my came right back

1152
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,480
and we had to we had to quarantine all

1153
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:42,159
of our plants it was very very arduous

1154
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,000
so rusted mites are very difficult to

1155
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:45,679
deal with typically some of the things

1156
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,400
you can do for them are like the

1157
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:51,358
predatory mites i had mentioned earlier

1158
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,240
because russet mites can often be

1159
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:56,880
transferred on the air believe it or not

1160
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:58,799
they're so small that they can catch

1161
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,400
wind really easily and in a strong gust

1162
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,720
of when they can be propelled up into

1163
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,160
the air and move um

1164
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:06,000
hundreds of meters

1165
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:07,279
sometimes short distances sometimes long

1166
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,039
distances

1167
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,040
but what'll happen oftentimes they'll

1168
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:13,920
get into your grow either on people's

1169
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:16,239
clothing or on the wind or whatever and

1170
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,159
they get onto one plant

1171
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:21,118
and they have a very simple life cycle

1172
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:23,118
they live fast and they reproduce often

1173
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,079
so they don't survive for very much more

1174
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,640
than

1175
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,960
like nine or ten days in a lot of cases

1176
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,400
and uh they reproduce rapidly so

1177
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,440
usually what will happen is if they come

1178
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,559
in on the wind or if they get

1179
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,720
transferred to somebody up through

1180
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:37,920
clothing they'll be like one or a couple

1181
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:40,719
of hot spots and then those popul those

1182
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:44,318
plants that get infected first will sort

1183
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:46,239
of show the symptoms much quickly and uh

1184
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:49,119
if you recognize it immediately uh

1185
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:51,199
rested mice often create a um

1186
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,240
like a crinkled surface on the leaves of

1187
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,679
plants they can cause a

1188
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:57,118
crinkling and if they're in a high

1189
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:00,078
population you can almost see them like

1190
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,920
an orange reddish orange dust

1191
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,359
on the plant itself which is a very

1192
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,440
bizarre looking for people who have not

1193
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,039
experienced it but if you do have that

1194
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,280
case i would recommend culling the

1195
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:10,880
plants that are most problematic and

1196
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,040
then applying something like a sulfur

1197
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,000
spray like i mentioned earlier or

1198
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:17,920
predatory myself swirsky or cocumurus i

1199
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,920
find it is highly effective you

1200
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,358
mentioned calling off the plant so

1201
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,039
killing off the plants

1202
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:24,559
the last thing people want to do but i'm

1203
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:25,358
glad you're brutally honest because

1204
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:27,599
there's

1205
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:29,119
i've seen so many people that have

1206
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,359
gotten rusted mites

1207
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,200
you know and it's it's too late you know

1208
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:35,440
they got to the point where they have to

1209
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,519
call it because there's just no way

1210
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,838
around it so inspecting your plane on a

1211
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:42,318
daily basis once you identify it take an

1212
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:44,719
immediate action is certainly key for

1213
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:47,358
for something like rusted mites for sure

1214
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:49,759
rapidity especially i have to agree with

1215
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:50,960
you there how about broad mites kind of

1216
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,720
similar can you talk to us about

1217
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,599
bromites and kind of their life cycle

1218
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,239
and such

1219
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,880
yeah so broad mites are very similar in

1220
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:01,598
damage and in profile

1221
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,039
so recit mites have a sort of worm-like

1222
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,519
body when you see them under a scope

1223
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,279
and broad mice have kind of a american

1224
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:10,559
football shape to them

1225
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,160
and

1226
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:15,199
whereas rusted mice produce kind of

1227
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:18,799
circular eggs broad mites produce like a

1228
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:21,199
sort of a oblong egg that has um

1229
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,760
little protrusions called tubercles but

1230
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:26,559
on a camera they often look like polka

1231
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,160
dots so if they if it's sort of a dotted

1232
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,519
egg that you're looking at and you see

1233
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:33,039
sort of a similar crinkling gnarling

1234
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:34,480
that's happening to your plant leaves

1235
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,079
then you're probably dealing with broad

1236
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,358
mites but you'll probably also see the

1237
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,359
adults moving around

1238
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,480
so recip sorry so broad mites

1239
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,239
have a similar sort of treatment regimen

1240
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,920
to russet mites to be honest because

1241
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:49,598
they cause similar damage it's

1242
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,519
oftentimes very useful to just get rid

1243
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:54,000
of a plant if it's very highly infested

1244
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,599
if you have like a row of plants or if

1245
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,679
you have like a homegrown situation

1246
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,880
where you've got like again like a bedro

1247
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:01,118
and there's like

1248
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,680
multiple plants but like one or two of

1249
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,880
them is really bad i very much recommend

1250
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,519
just getting rid of one of the worst

1251
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,160
ones if you can afford to do so

1252
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:12,480
uh it can be very critical to your like

1253
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:13,920
you said to your success at the end

1254
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,440
um

1255
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,760
that's why it's important to be very

1256
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,358
vigilant and if you can see the damage

1257
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,200
earlier and when it's only on a couple

1258
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:23,119
of leaves rather than the entire plant

1259
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,639
you are going to be much more successful

1260
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,240
again

1261
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:28,078
applications of things like sulfur

1262
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:29,598
sprays are very useful i don't want to

1263
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,440
sound too much like a broken record

1264
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,119
there but um a lot of these predatory

1265
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,720
mites are very useful for that reason

1266
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,920
that's why people like to use them a lot

1267
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:40,559
and again maintaining that population

1268
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,318
before you get the problem is really

1269
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,639
great because an ingressing small

1270
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:47,519
population gets decimated and

1271
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:49,598
annihilated away before it approaches

1272
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,838
sort of a pistiferous level

1273
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,200
um let's see let me think about that for

1274
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:54,799
a moment is that everything that's

1275
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:56,960
important for them

1276
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,640
um oh well we just talked about white

1277
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,920
flies so

1278
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:02,159
believe it or not the silver leaf

1279
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,920
firefly is another problem which is that

1280
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:06,159
broad mites are actually attracted to

1281
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,720
the wax that they produce specifically

1282
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:10,960
that species and so broad might will get

1283
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:13,279
up there's a very famous uh scanning

1284
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,838
electron microscope image of a white fly

1285
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,200
with a bunch of broad mice on its legs

1286
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:18,559
and

1287
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:20,719
what will happen is that the broadway's

1288
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,639
attached to them the white fly flies to

1289
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:25,679
another plant and the broad mice feed on

1290
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:28,639
it broad mites genus name is polyphago

1291
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:31,358
tarcinemas tarcinium is the type of mite

1292
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:33,598
poly means many fago means eat they eat

1293
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:35,519
a lot of plants many many many kinds of

1294
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,760
plants so whatever the wi-fi lands on

1295
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:39,519
it's probably a suitable host so that's

1296
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,160
another thing to watch out for that's

1297
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:43,679
crazy you mentioned for all the pests we

1298
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:45,519
talked about sometimes you mentioned

1299
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:47,919
kind of what the damage would look like

1300
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:49,599
on the plant i assume that the folks

1301
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,519
could potentially go to your youtube

1302
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,760
channel and kind of see more detailed

1303
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:55,599
images of like you know the damage that

1304
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,800
the past studio plants or do you have a

1305
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,559
website or what absolutely so

1306
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,400
you can find a lot of that

1307
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:04,318
information in fact i do have a video on

1308
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,680
broad might damage in particular and

1309
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:07,199
what they look like when you're looking

1310
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:08,639
at them through the microscope and also

1311
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,838
what their damage looks like on the

1312
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,480
plants

1313
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:13,519
so that's xenthanol on youtube

1314
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,079
you can also check me out on

1315
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:18,400
sentinel.com as well but a lot of that

1316
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,000
free educational information is on the

1317
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,920
sentinel youtube channel i think it's

1318
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,358
very important a lot of people just

1319
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,680
don't get access to this kind of

1320
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:27,358
information or these pictures until they

1321
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:28,879
actually have to deal with them which is

1322
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:30,159
way too late

1323
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,838
but if they're able to recognize it

1324
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:35,759
earlier um it just it is night and day

1325
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:37,279
for success rates that's awesome that

1326
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,960
they can just go to your channel and and

1327
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,040
reference those because that can

1328
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,199
definitely be helpful and understanding

1329
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:44,639
what's attacking their plant you know

1330
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,719
what i mean seeing the actual damage

1331
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:48,000
that's happening so cool so let's get

1332
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:50,799
into some of the things that are very

1333
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,318
common with outdoors so grasshoppers for

1334
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,160
example let's start with them those are

1335
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:55,838
the ones that things that will crawl all

1336
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:57,519
over your plants and and eat the leaves

1337
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:00,000
and stuff so talk to us about

1338
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:02,000
grasshoppers you know life cycle and how

1339
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,079
do you combat them and things like that

1340
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,039
you got to be very careful and depending

1341
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,000
on where you are in the world

1342
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:10,480
grasshoppers can be on locust can be a

1343
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,239
massively big problem that one

1344
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,318
particular cultivator is just not going

1345
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:15,679
to be able to handle very effectively to

1346
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:18,318
be honest and

1347
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:20,000
even in the united states of america

1348
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:22,000
uh you know in most places in the world

1349
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,920
it costs millions of dollars for nations

1350
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,599
to to deal with the damage and they use

1351
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,680
very harsh chemistries and they still

1352
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,800
don't have great control

1353
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:30,159
so

1354
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,760
this is going to be very generalized

1355
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:33,118
information because there's many

1356
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,839
different kinds of grasshoppers but

1357
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:38,400
they're incredibly good at dealing

1358
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:40,559
with pesticides and things like that

1359
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:44,480
and they move in large swarms a lot of

1360
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:47,039
the time as well in in bands rather

1361
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,318
and so grasshoppers a lot of times when

1362
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:50,400
people are dealing with grasshopper

1363
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:51,759
damage um

1364
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,119
i think that the best way to actually

1365
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,319
deal with them if you are in a place

1366
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,400
where you get a lot of them is actually

1367
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:57,759
to create sort of a physical barrier

1368
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,760
like a mesh screen or something like

1369
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,680
that mesh screens work really well for

1370
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,880
other things like thrips if you can get

1371
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:05,118
drip screen

1372
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,559
and and other sorts of things like mods

1373
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,559
that will come in and lay eggs on your

1374
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:10,480
plants so mesh screen is good for those

1375
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,078
pests as well but

1376
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,519
specifically for grasshoppers it's

1377
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,760
really good because there's not a whole

1378
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:17,280
lot of things you can do for them

1379
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,280
grasshoppers

1380
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,359
the females will

1381
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:26,319
lay their eggs into soil usually and

1382
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:28,639
then see you know in a season those

1383
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:29,838
nymphs come out of the soil so one of

1384
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:31,598
the things you can do for them as

1385
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:34,400
they're developing the soil is you can

1386
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:36,800
apply something like uh nosema

1387
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,358
which is a microsporidium parasite you

1388
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,760
can also apply a certain fungi there

1389
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:43,759
that exists into the soil as well and

1390
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,680
that can kind of damage them you can

1391
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,359
also apply certain chemistries too but a

1392
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,440
lot of times those are kind of haz or

1393
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:51,598
just for the environment and i i'm not a

1394
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,880
huge advocate for it but sometimes it's

1395
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,318
between you feeding your family and

1396
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,680
you know having to deal with the the

1397
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:00,318
locus so

1398
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:02,239
it can be a very difficult balance to um

1399
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:03,679
to set there that's why i think the

1400
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:05,118
physical barriers are just so much

1401
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:07,118
important but so much more important

1402
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,599
especially if you're in a sort of a

1403
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:11,599
smaller space it's a lot more manageable

1404
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,880
to expect rather than a large field or

1405
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,400
something like that

1406
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,039
let's see what else is there to say

1407
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,039
about them yeah i think that's a i mean

1408
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:21,279
that should be helpful uh

1409
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:24,318
for sprays i like to use buffer bastiana

1410
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:27,280
and in particular um there's a strain of

1411
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:29,599
it called puvari bastiana gha that's

1412
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,599
actually stands for grasshopper active

1413
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,960
which a lot of people don't know

1414
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:37,119
it was actually first colonized on

1415
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,880
cucumber beetles but they took it they

1416
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,519
reproduced it on grasshoppers a bunch of

1417
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,440
times and now it's very well adapted to

1418
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:45,440
grasshoppers so i'm a big fan of using

1419
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,440
that as well okay

1420
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,440
next up i have on the list i grouped

1421
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,639
together caterpillars and inchworms i'm

1422
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,639
not sure if you think those would be

1423
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:54,400
appropriate to group together or not but

1424
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:56,960
can you talk to us about caterpillars

1425
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,440
inchworms life cycle how to battle

1426
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,400
things like that absolutely

1427
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,880
you know

1428
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,480
the lepidoptera of miles and butterflies

1429
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,440
is actually one of the one of the four

1430
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,679
biggest

1431
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:11,039
uh insect orders so there's a ton of

1432
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:13,440
variation but generally speaking um it

1433
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:15,119
goes like this a moth or a butterfly

1434
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,440
will lay an egg the egg turns into a

1435
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,519
caterpillar you know it capillary comes

1436
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,519
out of the egg it's very very tiny and

1437
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:25,119
it has to grow really really quickly

1438
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:27,358
really rapidly so a lot of caterpillars

1439
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,960
that people deal with that are pests are

1440
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:30,480
pests because they're basically

1441
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,159
invisible they only eat a little bit of

1442
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,159
food because they're so small but then

1443
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:36,639
as they start to grow and this is true

1444
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:38,639
for like army worms like spedoptera

1445
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:39,920
helicoverpa the bud worms and things

1446
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:41,358
like this

1447
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,440
they will

1448
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:45,679
they will feed on the plant leaves and

1449
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,000
other foliage and if you're not paying

1450
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:49,919
close attention in a couple of weeks or

1451
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,838
so maybe about one week or one week and

1452
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,480
a half uh

1453
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:57,039
all of the larvae are now going to

1454
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,519
become a larger instar and then they eat

1455
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:01,838
like a much more massive amount of food

1456
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:03,358
so all of a sudden the decimation tanks

1457
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:05,679
you and you're like where did this come

1458
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:07,358
from and that's a very common complaint

1459
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:09,199
with a lot of these really pistiferous

1460
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:11,519
caterpillars

1461
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:13,838
if you don't cruciferous vegetables and

1462
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:15,838
other things like that

1463
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:17,599
so the caterpillar turns into some sort

1464
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:19,358
of a chrysalis or a pupa if they're

1465
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,838
moths they tend to

1466
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:23,358
either they'll wrap around silk and

1467
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:26,960
leaves and create

1468
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:30,000
a pupa in the foliage or they might uh

1469
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,679
go to the ground and burrow and create a

1470
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
pupa in the soil it depends on what

1471
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:35,838
species you're dealing with

1472
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
uh caterpillars and moths can also be

1473
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:40,159
very difficult to identify sometimes if

1474
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,440
you don't have

1475
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:46,000
either a really recognizable larval

1476
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,599
stage so like usually an older larva but

1477
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,119
a lot of these things like you can look

1478
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:50,720
it up

1479
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,240
they'll have very very different

1480
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:54,078
morphologies

1481
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:55,759
they'll be the same species but like one

1482
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,960
of them will be like a light green with

1483
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,400
some lines

1484
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,720
you know another and then they'll have

1485
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,559
another phenotype that's like dark black

1486
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:04,078
with like white spots and it's like

1487
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,680
they're the same species but they look

1488
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,480
nothing alike so that can be very

1489
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:10,960
confusing for people as well same is

1490
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,800
also true for the adult forms mods can

1491
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,960
often be

1492
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,160
different in phenotype and so that can

1493
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,400
cause some some issues with

1494
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:20,239
identification but if you can identify

1495
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,000
it if you can go to an extension agent

1496
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:25,199
or if you're able to look it up yourself

1497
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,719
or contact me i'm happy to help um then

1498
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:28,719
that can be something that you can do to

1499
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:30,799
identify and then you can render the

1500
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:32,639
appropriate treatment for them because

1501
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,960
some larvae they like to stay on the

1502
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:36,558
foliage some larvae

1503
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,960
you like to bore into the flower

1504
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,640
material or the fruit material you know

1505
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,599
getting a worm in your apples so to

1506
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,519
speak

1507
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:45,920
so it really does depend on what you're

1508
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:47,519
growing and what you're dealing with

1509
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,119
if there's something like a burrowing

1510
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:51,039
caterpillar that likes to get into the

1511
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,720
stem or the fluoro tissue

1512
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:55,358
you know that's very difficult and also

1513
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:58,318
present a kind of a quagmire because

1514
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:59,920
even if you do kill it somehow

1515
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:01,679
the rotting corpse

1516
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,039
of that caterpillar

1517
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:05,199
is going to

1518
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:07,279
foul the rest of the material in your

1519
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:09,358
plant whether it's a medicinal plant or

1520
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,559
whether it's a fruit-bearing plant or

1521
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:14,078
something like that so it can again kind

1522
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,000
of like what i said with the grasshopper

1523
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:18,640
sometimes the best you know the best

1524
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,039
defense is to not play the game and to

1525
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:23,358
have some sort of a physical barrier or

1526
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:25,599
something like that that keeps them from

1527
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:27,679
laying the eggs on the plants now

1528
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,400
some larvae

1529
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:30,000
do

1530
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,519
constantly move from one plant to

1531
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,280
another plant and they'll travel along

1532
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:35,119
the ground like those army worms i kind

1533
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,359
of briefly mentioned

1534
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,720
but a lot of times that's not the case

1535
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:40,480
and so like with the inchworms you're

1536
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:42,159
talking about they don't make a whole

1537
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,760
big habit of like moving across the

1538
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,519
ground because that's very dangerous for

1539
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,520
them

1540
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:49,440
so in those cases you know i would i

1541
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:51,440
would really say that a physical barrier

1542
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,440
is really important and being very

1543
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,838
vigilant and either picking them off

1544
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,960
having chickens maybe even to run

1545
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:59,759
through

1546
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,400
can be very effective you can also buy

1547
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,720
parasitoid wasps like trichogramma which

1548
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,358
is an egg parasitoid it parasites the

1549
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:10,000
eggs and then other ones that parasitize

1550
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:12,000
the larvae themselves there's actually

1551
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,559
also some viruses you can buy

1552
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,559
polyhedrosis viruses that are for

1553
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,079
certain species they only target that

1554
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,440
species

1555
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,960
you apply it on your plants the

1556
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,400
caterpillars eat the foliage

1557
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,358
unfortunately some foliage has to be

1558
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,119
eaten

1559
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:27,440
but then it gets into their gut and it

1560
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,200
destroys them from the inside out

1561
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,838
so that's available for some people as

1562
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:35,279
well but by and large

1563
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:37,279
the best strategy is to not be there or

1564
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,800
not be

1565
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,319
vulnerable to their presence in the

1566
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,200
first place because the moths can't get

1567
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:42,960
through

1568
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:44,078
a barrier that's fine

1569
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,920
usually

1570
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:48,318
you mentioned how some can borrow in the

1571
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,880
stem and actually burrow themselves in

1572
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:52,800
the flower as well you know one thing if

1573
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,960
you're leaving caterpillars on there or

1574
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,400
inchworms or whatever some of them you

1575
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,079
know take dumps all over your flowers

1576
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,000
right so if you're

1577
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,839
if you're growing medicinal varieties

1578
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,599
and you've got caterpillars all over

1579
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:05,920
your buds well then you've got their

1580
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,599
waste on their buds too so just keep

1581
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,838
that in mind you don't want to be uh

1582
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,200
smoking waste

1583
00:54:08,838 --> 00:54:12,880
there yeah and it can be a vector for

1584
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:15,039
fungal problems too and they create

1585
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,280
lesions as well so it's just all around

1586
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:19,039
it's a very very difficult thing to deal

1587
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,200
with you want to not have the damage in

1588
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:22,960
the first place which is easy to say but

1589
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:26,719
that's why preventative measures are so

1590
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,920
critical let's touch on leaf miners next

1591
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:30,078
now you said there's a couple different

1592
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,920
types you know whichever type you feel

1593
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,359
is is more common that you want to cover

1594
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,280
you know feel free to cover but let us

1595
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:38,159
know about leaf miners their life cycle

1596
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,160
and how to combat absolutely so there

1597
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:42,558
are some mods that are called leaf miner

1598
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:43,759
mods and so they have us they just have

1599
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,240
a similar

1600
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,240
uh style of growing as the fly leaf

1601
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:49,679
miners that exist so the leaf miner

1602
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:50,959
flies are actually some of the first

1603
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:52,719
pests i ever dealt with in a

1604
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,159
professional capacity so i know all

1605
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:57,199
about them

1606
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:58,960
the agromazety are the leaf minor flies

1607
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:02,399
and they feed on all kinds of things

1608
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:04,639
like celery ornamental flowers

1609
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,400
pepper plants and also various weedy

1610
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:08,639
plants as you might find as you're

1611
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,599
walking across your neighborhood but

1612
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:13,679
both the moths and the flies basically

1613
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:16,318
have a similar sort of situation where

1614
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:18,639
they lay eggs on the plant or inside the

1615
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:20,960
the leaf tissue and essentially both of

1616
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:24,400
the larvae of both of these groups will

1617
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:27,119
exist within the thin margins between

1618
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,400
the upper and lower leaves and as they

1619
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,480
feed they get bigger and bigger and

1620
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,559
create these like long winding tunnels

1621
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,280
sometimes they're in a design sometimes

1622
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:37,920
it's kind of chaotic but essentially

1623
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,920
uh after a period of time the larvae

1624
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,000
will um

1625
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,838
pupate certain species do different

1626
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,599
things sometimes they pupate outside

1627
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:49,039
sometimes they pupate inside it just

1628
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:51,680
depends um and then a fly or a moth will

1629
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:54,239
come out of the pupa and that's how the

1630
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:55,519
life cycle occurs so uh kind of want to

1631
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:57,358
prevent that from happening in the first

1632
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:59,199
place if you're dealing with leaf minor

1633
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:01,279
flies

1634
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:02,960
i like to use something like a

1635
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,359
parasitoid wasp

1636
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,838
like a diglyphus acidity which is very

1637
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:10,400
commonly used

1638
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:11,920
in commercial settings at least

1639
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,079
but you can also

1640
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,159
yeah you can also use

1641
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,318
there's a dachnusa sibirica which is

1642
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:20,798
also a parasitoid wasp as well that can

1643
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:24,880
be utilized against them

1644
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:26,559
the leaf miner flies in my experience

1645
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,440
they often do

1646
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:31,680
become resistant to harsh chemistries in

1647
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,760
commercial agriculture

1648
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:35,199
it's very common to utilize systemic

1649
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,760
pesticides against them because they

1650
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:40,399
live systemically in the plant right

1651
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,200
which makes sense but in my experience

1652
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,200
i've

1653
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:45,838
i've actually had the

1654
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,759
opportunity to collect samples and then

1655
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:50,880
have them tested for resistance to

1656
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,960
various common systemic chemistries and

1657
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,599
they've come back with some egregious

1658
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:58,159
levels like 600 times

1659
00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:00,480
resistant you know when a resistance

1660
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:02,399
level is like a factor of like 10

1661
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,159
they're like 600.

1662
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,639
you could swim in that compound and have

1663
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:08,480
no problems so just be very careful that

1664
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:10,318
uh if you use a chemistry even like

1665
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,559
something that's less harsh

1666
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:14,400
it might not be super effective

1667
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,359
against them so that's just something to

1668
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,160
consider

1669
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:20,719
and um as far as treating them though

1670
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:22,960
uh yeah those parasitoids are very good

1671
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:25,358
um when they insert into the leaves

1672
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,280
sometimes they have a hole right

1673
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:29,440
especially if flies they overposit they

1674
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:32,079
create this little hole when they when

1675
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,440
they sting the they sting the leaf as

1676
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:35,599
they say

1677
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:38,159
and then uh that opening can be

1678
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:39,838
exploited with like some some of the

1679
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:42,318
things i said before like isaiah

1680
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:44,639
fumosarcia is a fungus that you can

1681
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:46,719
apply the buvaria fungus i mentioned

1682
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:47,920
earlier can work well and you can sort

1683
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:50,159
of um

1684
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,079
you can apply it and the spores get into

1685
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:54,719
the tunnel and they can get into the

1686
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,720
larvae if you apply it sort of an

1687
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:58,399
aggressive rate i find that can be also

1688
00:57:56,719 --> 00:58:00,480
useful

1689
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,160
great great information for sure you

1690
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,240
mentioned that you know some of these

1691
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:06,960
pests they're going to leave

1692
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:08,239
deposits or waste on the plant right

1693
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,639
some folks what they'll do on the

1694
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:12,479
medicinal plants is they will after they

1695
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:13,759
harvest losing bud washing i'm not sure

1696
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,599
if you've heard about what body washing

1697
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,599
is but basically they'll take their

1698
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,359
plant and they'll dunk it in water they

1699
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:22,160
dunk it into a solution usually it's

1700
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:24,000
like baking soda and lemon juice mixed

1701
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:25,759
together uh they'll don't dunk it in

1702
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,519
there try to get all the waste off then

1703
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,200
they'll dunk it in a bucket of plain

1704
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:30,880
water then they'll dunk it in another

1705
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:32,399
bucket of plain water right so they're

1706
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,280
they're trying to get the debris or the

1707
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,960
waste

1708
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,640
off what are your thoughts overall

1709
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,559
thoughts on blood washing

1710
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:40,960
you know i have i kind of go back and

1711
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:42,400
forth on it and on the one hand i feel

1712
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,079
like

1713
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,519
in some cases especially if you're

1714
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,519
growing for yourself maybe that's a

1715
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:50,000
remediation that

1716
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:51,920
is useful for you but on the other hand

1717
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,838
i do think that you might damage some of

1718
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,798
the medicinal um

1719
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:57,759
you know

1720
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:59,440
constituents for lack of a better term

1721
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,119
if you're doing that if you're washing

1722
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,039
like fruits and vegetables and things

1723
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:04,400
like that i think that's actually really

1724
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,838
appropriate and useful and a lot of

1725
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,240
people do that

1726
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:09,279
with great efficacy um again if we're

1727
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:11,519
dealing with something like the leaf

1728
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,798
minor larvae those sorts of things

1729
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:14,960
that's going to be embedded in the

1730
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:15,920
tissues and much harder to deal with

1731
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,838
um

1732
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,960
but uh you know if you got a lot of like

1733
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:22,880
uh frass uh as they call it on the on

1734
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,480
the medicinal plant material and things

1735
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,720
like that

1736
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,159
um personally i mean i think maybe like

1737
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:30,239
shaking it off and things like that can

1738
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:32,960
be useful but i like to just cut it away

1739
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:35,519
it's um you know of course that's

1740
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,679
painful to say but uh i'd rather do that

1741
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:40,079
personally than um than the alternative

1742
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:42,399
because i think you might overall maybe

1743
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,839
degrade the problem the project uh sorry

1744
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:47,200
the product further gotcha that makes

1745
00:59:44,838 --> 00:59:49,279
sense well we covered a lot in this

1746
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:50,960
podcast episode certainly didn't cover

1747
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,798
every single pass there is love to know

1748
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,720
in the comment section below what pest

1749
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:56,318
didn't we cover that you would like to

1750
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:58,480
see in the future let us know down in

1751
00:59:56,318 --> 01:00:00,000
the comment section below

1752
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,519
matthew this was awesome this was really

1753
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,400
really cool just a great general

1754
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:06,960
overview of the top 10 pests that could

1755
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:09,440
invade your garden and what to do to

1756
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,760
combat them so really appreciate your

1757
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:14,318
time today and the knowledge that you've

1758

my educational information in two main

1768
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,640
places the first one is that xenthanol

1769
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,079
youtube channel

1770
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:37,920
where i produce

1771
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:40,240
observational footage

1772
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,838
pest primer videos about various pests

1773
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:43,838
and other sorts of things i just did an

1774
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:46,880
intro on um

1775
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:49,119
thyroids and with a particular

1776
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,960
emphasis on the hot blatant viroid uh

1777
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:52,880
which you can check out and i also make

1778
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:55,039
a lot of um

1779
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:58,318
information available on my instagram

1780
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:59,759
account at sync angel that's s-y-n-c-h

1781
01:00:58,318 --> 01:01:01,440
a-n-g-e-l

1782
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,160
and that's my personal account where i

1783
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:06,240
often have igtv live streams where i

1784
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:07,838
talk to people and my followers about

1785
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:09,039
various things like you and i are right

1786
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:11,199
now

1787
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:12,719
and those are the two major places where

1788
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:15,439
i produce that sort of content for

1789
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:16,959
people and um i'm very excited and i'm

1790
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,880
honestly humbled

1791
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,960
and it's a little bit surreal still

1792
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,880
after almost 12 years of doing this that

1793
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:25,358
i'm able to reach out and help as many

1794
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:27,680
people as i can i just want to emphasize

1795
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:30,078
that i work um

1796
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:32,078
tirelessly on this it's very much a

1797
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:34,079
passion of mine to keep people from

1798
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:35,839
being able to deal with pests

1799
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,119
especially in situations where the

1800
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:39,199
plants are

1801
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:42,160
lacking in support and infrastructure

1802
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:44,558
from various groups so i'm happy that

1803
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:46,480
you're also somebody who is facilitating

1804
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:48,960
that information that's crucial for our

1805
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,880
success thank you absolutely it's clear

1806
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,119
that you've got passion towards this so

1807
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,280
i love it just radiates from you and and

1808
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:56,720
it's infectious in a sense so awesome

1809
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,240
stuff like i mentioned earlier in the

1810
01:01:56,719 --> 01:01:59,759
episode i'll definitely have links to

1811
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:01,598
