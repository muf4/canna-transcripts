1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,019
coming up on Garden talk it's really

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,059
cheap and simple too to just build

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,740
whatever frame and size you want you

4
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:09,660
know get your extractor choose your

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,740
lights and then boom I use what's

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,000
available and one of the first things

7
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,039
available when I first started growing

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,679
again in Columbia was five gallon paint

9
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,239
buckets but like not used with paint so

10
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:19,858
there's no toxicities or anything you

11
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,358
just go buy a paint bucket it's like

12
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,439
three bucks or something I was like oh

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,820
it's so much better than going to the

14
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,439
gardening store they're like 10 bucks or

15
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,060
something here if you're all still a

16
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,379
little bit early in that flower and

17
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:30,719
you're seeing a lot of stretch on the

18
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:32,339
main stretchers if you need to do a

19
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,439
little bit of LST just a little bit to

20
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,200
slow her down and if you have to take

21
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,820
those two top four whatever suckers just

22
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,379
you know slow them down just a little

23
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,299
bit with a little bit of low stress

24
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:43,979
training this is a way to be able to

25
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,078
have your own medicine produce it for

26
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:47,398
yourself on a consistent basis in an

27
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,679
organic way where you actually know what

28
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,660
is inside your medicine and you get to

29
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,960
choose it

30
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:53,959
foreign

31
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,299

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,920
Talk podcast today I am joined with

71
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:35,700
Dakota from homegrow TV how you doing

72
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,899
today dude fantastic what an honor to be

73
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:39,359
on the show

74
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,620
Mr Grow it my bro can I call you Chris

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,599
now that you know we get to hang out

76
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,459
virtue like this for the first time of

77
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:46,560
course yeah absolutely dude no thanks

78
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,500
again bro for for having me on yeah I'm

79
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,519
excited for you to be on here and uh you

80
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,139
know the topic we're going to talk about

81
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,879
today is something that excites me

82
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,939
because it hasn't really been talked

83
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:58,259
about on my podcast yet which is closet

84
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:59,400
growing but really we're going to be

85
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:01,199
talking about like growing in small

86
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,000
spaces as well right so it's not just

87
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,439
closet growing but some people don't

88
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
have a closet they're just growing in a

89
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,158
small space we'll get all into that

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,098
because there's really some things that

91
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:13,439
you can do differently than you would do

92
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:15,119
in a larger growth space so kind of

93
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,459
narrowing it down specifically to those

94
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,900
small grow spaces closet growing I think

95
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,239
is going to be valuable to the audience

96
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,800
but first can you do an introduction

97
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,719
tell us a little bit about yourself and

98
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,060
how you got into gardening yes

99
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,859
definitely definitely so my name is

100
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,560
Dakota originally I'm from Edmonton

101
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,480
Alberta in Canada right now I'm living

102
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,459
here in near Medellin Colombia and

103
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,840
that's a long story we'll get there but

104
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,180
uh no originally Canadian at heart

105
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,500
absolutely you know love it I think a

106
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,360
lot of people notice I'm Canadian when

107
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,000
they start hearing me talking my boats

108
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,120
still come out quite a bit and uh

109
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,500
my journey into growing and finding this

110
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,759
medicinal plant is actually quite

111
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,900
interesting and it's really cool to be

112
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:53,579
able to come on here today and be able

113
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,140
to share it because

114
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,700
you know the format that I get to share

115
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:58,859
on YouTube and stuff we don't really go

116
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:00,658
into my backstory so often and getting

117
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,760
to do a few interviews myself it's not

118
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:04,378
getting into the backstory of homegirl

119
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,938
TV and how we got here today so it's

120
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,818
really cool to to be able to dive into

121
00:04:05,938 --> 00:04:10,979
that and what makes it so different is

122
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:13,378
the fact of like kind of like the age I

123
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:15,780
got into it at and how

124
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:18,358
um how I ended up finding it it was

125
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,858
actually my what I call my stepdad

126
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,739
um you know my mother's boyfriend at the

127
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,359
time and I was

128
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,519
1617

129
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,020
and I had started to have my first kind

130
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,639
of relationship with you know the

131
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:31,859
medicinal side of it and starting to see

132
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,720
it I suffered a lot at a young age of

133
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,360
migraines I used to be like hardcore

134
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,100
once a month and this was like it'd be

135
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,620
either full one day or if not a two

136
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,759
three day migraine and my mom didn't

137
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,000
know at the beginning but I ended up

138
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,740
finding this you know to be a solution

139
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,680
and I came back from a trip and I was 16

140
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,780
years old and I go into the basement and

141
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,120
my stepdad shows me this little wooden

142
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:56,638
closet and it was built out of a wooden

143
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,620
frame and he said this system right here

144
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,360
what I'm about to show you and I had no

145
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,079
idea what's inside I'm like talk about a

146
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,060
you know a a build up of of uh of what's

147
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,439
to come and he's just like tell me the

148
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,819
rules first like what I'm about to show

149
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,139
you this is a way to be able to have

150
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:11,879
your own medicine

151
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,100
and produce it for yourself on a

152
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,659
consistent basis in an organic way where

153
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,240
you actually know what is inside your

154
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:21,060
medicine and you get to choose it and I

155
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,860
was like okay what is in this box you

156
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,560
know and so it was with a little screw

157
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,600
drill and he undrills it and it opens up

158
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,978
and I just see like a row of six little

159
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,199
plants and they had these little white

160
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:33,060
pistols coming out and I had never seen

161
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,520
the plant in that form I just had always

162
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,199
seen it in its final cured form you know

163
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,659
I wasn't edu you know this was my first

164
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,939
entrance into seeing this this format so

165
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,979
my entry into the to the growing world

166
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:45,660
was actually through you know through

167
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:47,459

168
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:51,120
was books like you know the grow Bible

or Jorge Cervantes you know course I got

170
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,180
you know taken through those steps by

171
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,579
steps but in person and given that book

172
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,079
and given that course and like the first

173
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:59,159
thing ever in my hands that was the

174
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,199
first like year and a half was that

175
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,300
little that little uh closet grow and it

176
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,759
was a three little step formula and it

177
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,100
was really like a two by six is what it

178
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,720
was and this was you know your flower

179
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,160
your veg and your mom room and your

180
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,380
clone room up top and it was like little

181
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,520
T5 bulbs for you know for the clones and

182
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:16,199
I didn't know any of these things and he

183
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,519
was just showing me the system and he

184
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,960
was like the first thing also he's like

185
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,818
that same day here's your Journal you

186
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,839
write down everything you do to these

187
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:23,160
beautiful plants and everything that

188
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,978
goes into them and you write down any

189
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,620
signs from here on out and uh this is

190
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:30,478
now you know like immediately just took

191
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,860
to such a beautiful hobby to see them

192
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,918
change from the first day I seen them

193
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,300
then go in the next day for a week later

194
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,339
immediately I was hooked I took it very

195
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,560
seriously and I seen the

196
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:42,659
you know the impacts of

197
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,000
the way you treat you know this plant

198
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:48,000
and what comes out of it after oh my God

199
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,220
that first harvest was the most insane

200
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,660
thing you know that that I've ever seen

201
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,699
still today and I'll remember it clear

202
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,380
as day that was kind of the grow getting

203
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,300
getting into my first kind of experience

204
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:59,819
with closet grows and that from there

205
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,560
that same technique went into grow

206
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,879
um slightly bigger spaces but it was

207
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,519
always still building our own wood

208
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,959
frames white reflective poly you know

209
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,698
grow tents wasn't something I heard of

210
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,219
yet or seen LEDs was something you only

211
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,500
seen in High Times magazine

212
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,479
um HPS was the light we were using then

213
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,860
for everything badge was just T5 so it's

214
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:18,899
nice little thin bulbs that we just put

215
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,280
on a nice little panel and it was a lot

216
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:22,258
of D you know do-it-yourself building

217
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,239
you know working with wood and kind of

218
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,038
doing it but that was getting that

219
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,019
respect and understanding for creating

220
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:30,000
your own environments in a small space

221
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:32,098
and that's what I thought the topic

222
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,959
today was so good to dive more into the

223
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:35,879
small space closet grow

224
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,439
uh compared to I do have you know

225
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,819
experience with bigger tents and bigger

226
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,339
girls then but that's what started it

227
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:43,139
all and I still to date now always have

228
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,659
you know these small two by fours or

229
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,639
Clothes Closet style grows because I

230
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,660
just found the importance number one of

231
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,038
controlling your environment and then

232
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,199
the ease of doing it in the smaller

233
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:55,139
space learning there was was gave me

234
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,699
great you know kind of uh Foundation to

235
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,038
go to a you know from there I think

236
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,660
we're building enough for 20 plants and

237
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,219
into something a little bit bigger and

238
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,479
that was you know a totally different

239
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,120
space but

240
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:08,519
the little the what you can do in just a

241
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,579
closet size built you know by yourself

242
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:14,279
at home and help it self-sustaining you

243
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:16,439
know Perpetual Harvest that absolutely

244
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:18,779
blew my mind it's pretty cool to hear

245
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,399
your story about how you started and

246
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:22,138
starting with a small space and kind of

247
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,478
working your way up into bigger space so

248
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,220
you have experience in in Bolt types of

249
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,560
environments right that's really cool to

250
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,240
hear I have to ask how did the whole

251
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,800
YouTube thing come about right so you're

252
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,959
real known for your YouTube channel

253
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,278
called homegirl TV I'll definitely have

254
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,018
a link to it down in the YouTube

255
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,038
description section below you currently

256
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,620
have 21

257
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:43,439
000 subscribers on your channel and I

258
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,839
must say your video production is insane

259
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,279
I mean you're up there with the best of

260
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,019
the best as far as video production

261
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,659
bringing everybody up to the next level

262
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:53,580
and as far as video production how did

263
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:54,899
that all come about so yeah that's a

264
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,180
great question that follows up through

265
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,220
that was my again getting into and

266
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:01,439
finding what it was like to grow finding

267
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,060
how easy it was to be self-sustaining

268
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,240
with your own medicinal you know plants

269
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:08,399
at home that eventually ended up coming

270
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,539
to a full stop when I get into again I

271
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,639
was so young when I got into it I

272
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:13,439
continued that until about you know 18

273
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,600
19 years old worked a few construction

274
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,160
jobs and then I actually was blessed

275
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,080
enough to have a friend who also worked

276
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:20,759
construction and he got into the world

277
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,860
of affiliate marketing online marketing

278
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:26,639
internet marketing and this was back in

279
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:28,500
like 2011 and 12 when I decided at 19

280
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,480
years old I'm going to get into

281
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,159
affiliate marketing and I'm not sure if

282
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,379
you're familiar with with authors like

283
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,419
Tim Ferriss the four-hour work week and

284
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:38,278
these different uh people in the self

285
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:40,019
development world that was one of the

286
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,338
first books I read was a four-hour work

287
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,959
week and I've learned about Geo

288
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,300
Arbitrage where you're getting paid in

289
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:48,059
US Dollars Canadian dollars and then

290
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:50,399
spending that in somewhere else so at 19

291
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:52,079
years old I went to Thailand and I was

292
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,539
barely making any money online but it

293
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,180
was gonna be more than more than it was

294
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:58,740
worth in in Canada so I took the risk

295
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:01,259
and I went with my buddy and and it

296
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,120
ended up really snowballing and turning

297
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:04,620
into more income that I could have

298
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,299
thought of at that time more freedom

299
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,339
that's what got me to Colombia as well

300
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:10,679
in 2013 we did nine months in Thailand

301
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:12,720
and then I came out to Colombia for just

302
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:16,739
three months that was my plan and that

303
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,778
was 2013. now we are in what 2022 I'm

304
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,399
still here absolutely loving it you know

305
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:22,679
traveling out here often but this is my

306
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,500
home base here in Columbia and since

307
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:27,719
then in 2016 I made a transition into

308
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,059
filmmaking and it was a lot in the

309
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,920
advertising uh filming in the marketing

310
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:33,778
world so as an affiliate marketer the

311
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,939
best way to sell a lot of my products at

312
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:37,200
19 was to create a video you know

313
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,820
driving and this is like back when

314
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,100
Facebook marketing was like just the

315
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,300
right side Banner ad with a photo and

316
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,519
then you click on it and it would go

317
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:46,500
like email and then video wasn't even a

318
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,820
thing yet on Facebook and so when it did

319
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,980
become a thing that was like I got to

320
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,019
learn this about Final Cut Pro in 2013

321
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,879
as well and I would just slowly do my

322
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,100
marketing videos and I found that on

323
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:58,379
Sundays which was my free day I was

324
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,120
editing videos till like 6 a.m of like

325
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:01,379
me traveling and all these like just

326
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,360
random things just trying to learn the

327
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:06,000
skill of editing and I sat down myself

328
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,800
and 2016 and that's like that's the

329
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,600
Blessed thing I why I continue to love

330
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:12,019
this plan so much because it was because

331
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,800
of this plan and on a creative session

332
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:15,240
just sitting there thinking and

333
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:17,639
analyzing my life I was like What would

334
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,519
life look like if that's all you did if

335
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,139
all you did was create film so in 2016 I

336
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,060
made a big risk and just started working

337
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,799
in the video World Learning the skill

338
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:28,139
set putting in the time what is editing

339
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:31,019
what are the basics of camera

340
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:34,259
and then oh my goodness a pretty much

341
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:36,240
pandemic or or the whole covert thing

342
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:38,338
started in 2020 I had been working in

343
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,839
film now just for a little bit I could

344
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,279
no longer travel to go to the clients

345
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,160
that I needed to go to in the events the

346
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,559
way I used to work and so I created uh

347
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,240
home go TV and I was like dang man what

348
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,439
if I did the same amount of effort

349
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,940
everything I was put into my clients

350
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,740
work their commercial work that stuff

351
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,839
and we just did it with this beautiful

352
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,778
thing that I used to do and I had

353
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,519
stopped growing for eight plus years

354
00:11:56,778 --> 00:12:00,958
traveling client work you know and I

355
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,959
didn't know in Colombia you could even

356
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,838
grow 20 plants legally everyone here by

357
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:08,458
by residents by household is legally

358
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,380
allowed to grow 20 medicinal plants in

359
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:12,419
their house with no said license so when

360
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:14,458
I found that out and this was again just

361
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:15,958
around right before covid-19 I was like

362
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,578
I'm gonna create the channel and just

363
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,319
slowly again that transition from

364
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:21,719
working with client work and marketing

365
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,519
to doing homegrown TV which really I

366
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,259
would say six to eight months ago is I'm

367
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,179
like I just want to go full time I just

368
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:29,480
want to hang out with these ladies film

369
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:32,399
them see them go from seed to harvest

370
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,019
document that part so that's that's kind

371
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,339
of where the the filming and the

372
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,019
production value comes from from the

373
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:39,839
Homegrown TV side and the storytelling

374
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:42,179
from that past experience I had creating

375
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,760
marketing videos and and filmmaking in

376
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:47,638
the world that's awesome wow so coming

377
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:50,039
up on 10 years video editing total since

378
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,560
you said he started in 2013 so no wonder

379
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:54,299
why you're so good

380
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:57,000
yeah that's fine I really do love it so

381
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:58,679
transitioning over to Growing you talked

382
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,240
a little bit about what your gross style

383
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,458
is right you mentioned indoors do you

384
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,560
also do outdoor growing as well also are

385
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:07,500
you organic are you mineral based or

386
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,939
often called synthetic and what medium

387
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,940
are you in are you soil great question

388
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,980
so hydroponic systems so being here in

389
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,440
Colombia it's crazy to say this but I'm

390
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:20,339
100 indoor right now here in Colombia we

391
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,260
have 365 all year round it's 12 12 light

392
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,240
it's perfect conditions for outdoor and

393
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,379
some of the biggest outdoor grows in the

394
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,759
world are based out here and that's why

395
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:28,679
I see these major companies now coming

396
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:30,419
down from Canada you you know from all

397
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:33,359
around the world really uh licensing

398
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:35,219
land and moving that direction so do we

399
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,839
do it yet no and that's mostly just

400
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,220
because of the property I live on I

401
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,540
cannot wait that's my goal within the

402
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,879
next year to get to a place where I can

403
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:44,039
have 10 outside Beauties and then 10

404
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,799
inside again limited to 20 without going

405
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:49,019
to to get a license so 100 indoor right

406
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,458
now but cannot wait to get outdoor the

407
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:53,100
medium we use

408
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:54,479
um is I started here in Columbia and

409
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,639
this is trial and Eric here in Columbia

410
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,959
dude it's so much different than back

411
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,839
when I was in Canada what's available

412
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:02,219
right like I can't go get what I what I

413
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,959
originally learned with so it was a

414
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,000
learning curve the first year here and I

415
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:08,338
have a great grow bro that you see a lot

416
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,839
on the channel his name is Mr Q he runs

417
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,579
a company here out of Columbia he has

418
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,199
been growing like a year more than or

419
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:15,359
more than that here in Colombia so he

420
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,819
had his his company down you know his

421
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,919
his feet down and he's like dude go to

422
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,199
Coco and it's like it cost me 10 bucks

423
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,479
for like a big Bulldog like a big coffee

424
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:26,939
or like a big potato sack 40 kilograms

425
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,860
uh 10 bucks for that and it cost me 10

426
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,779
bucks for a big bag of castings

427
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,199
earthworm castings another 40 kilos is

428
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:36,059
huge and so I follow his formula what he

429
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:38,338
taught me and I play between just Coco

430
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:39,958
5050 with the castings and it's not the

431
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,820
same quality castings again that I would

432
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,198
be used to in Canada that you might find

433
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,240
in the states

434
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,099
um it it doesn't it's not like just pure

435
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,419
like oh this is just you know Worm poop

436
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,639
like you can tell it's a little bit

437
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:52,559
Earth still but there's a lot of great

438
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,560
minerals in there so I usually play

439
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:58,259
between a 70 cocoa to 30 uh we call

440
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,939
hummus uh castings or 50 50 playing

441
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:02,759
anywhere between those those kind of

442
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,019
ratios and then for nutrients

443
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,419
um what's really cool at home grow tea

444
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:08,220
we're always just testing new things so

445
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:09,719
we've done a six-month cycle with Mills

446
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,699
nutrients

447
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,320
um you know we did a year cycle with an

448
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:15,379
organic line nutrients that is actually

449
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,660
my grow Bros

450
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:20,399
nutrient line and it's just a scene for

451
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:21,719
me to learn again to get my feet wet and

452
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,179
see okay that was the difference between

453
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,940
this now we're running Cutting Edge

454
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:28,500
um split with crunk so we're testing at

455
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,699
different times and we're never just

456
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,500
running through like okay just one

457
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:32,879
grotesque we're gonna run everything for

458
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,679
six months let's run it for a while

459
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,879
let's see how it works and then from

460
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,039
there we'll decide do we move on and

461
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:39,720
test more nutrients or are we going to

462
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:40,980
stick with these ones and I think we're

463
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,019
almost getting to the point where I'm

464
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,699
just like okay I've tried enough for

465
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,440
like let's just hang low for like a year

466
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:48,659
two years and just run this stuff and

467
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,279
start to dial it in more now with with

468
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:54,419
the plants and see how they're reacting

469
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:56,578
gotcha okay and you mentioned that you

470
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:59,099
started in a small grow space really

471
00:15:56,578 --> 00:16:00,719
your your closet is is framed in I guess

472
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,459
right you started in a framed area

473
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,079
there's a lot of people in a similar

474
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:06,619
situation to you where they want to

475
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,239
actually create a framed grow space

476
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,919
that's where you know around closet size

477
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,720
or it could be even smaller than that

478
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:14,458
talk to us in detail about how you went

479
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,040
about framing it even getting into the

480
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:19,859
details on like what size would you use

481
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:21,958
I I think you used either uh would use

482
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,800
the panda film a mylar so on and so

483
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,659
forth

484
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,219
great great question dude I love that

485
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:28,559
you're bringing me back to that time and

486
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,899
I really really hope uh I said that

487
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,278
watches us at some point because what

488
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:34,019
great times those were and I'd say like

489
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:36,480
the best way for people listening to

490
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,620
this or maybe watching this right now

491
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,060
um and thinking about building your

492
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,679
first one at home and like you wanted to

493
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:43,018
see someone do it I would go search out

494
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:45,179
Jorge Cervantes and like that original

495
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:47,339
grow course he shows you how to frame

496
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:49,019
out a room and the way we would do it is

497
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,579
we would look at the space so the first

498
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:52,620
one ever okay I know I have about this

499
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:55,739
much and we framed it about two by six

500
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,240
and again in Canada it's very typical in

501
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,799
most garages in your household you're

502
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,299
going to have power tools if not

503
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,500
someone's parents or his friends

504
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:02,819
someone's gonna have power tools if not

505
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,199
you would go Ransom when I first moved

506
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,959
oh that's what we go to the Home Depot

507
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,818
we'd rent what we needed and we just do

508
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,318
a day cutting measure everything out in

509
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:11,639
very simple framework you know I'm

510
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,980
really just talking like just you know

511
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,419
two by fours cut to the size you know

512
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,620
drilled together with with your power

513
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:18,059
drill

514
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,619
um depending on how big we went then

515
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:22,078
obviously we'd have side braces and

516
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:24,359
Brace it a few more but uh Jorge

517
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,399
Cervantes doesn't great bro in that old

518
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,659
school grainy film I think it's on

519
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,980
YouTube as well and he's up there and

520
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,720
they're just you know they're hanging

521
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,160
everything they're getting it up and

522
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,319
what we would use I don't know the name

523
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,298
but I knew it as black and white poly

524
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,700
and I don't know if it was made for

525
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:39,839
construction or if it was a gardening

526
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,580
thing

527
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,839
but I'm pretty sure I would get it at

528
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:43,918
the gardening store back then and that

529
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:45,418
wasn't something I would get at Home

530
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,100
Depot I can't remember specifically but

531
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:49,860
it was black on one side white on the

532
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:51,119
other and then what I liked about and I

533
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:52,979
still like about the idea of building

534
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,959
your own size grow room you can tailor

535
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:58,700
it to your own size you know and so when

536
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:02,100
I first did my grow my my grow on my own

537
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:04,080
outside you know without my stepdad

538
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:06,178
um taking me step by step we went a bit

539
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,399
bigger and we just custom built it to

540
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,679
whatever a basement was knowing okay we

541
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,019
just space out okay two plants we had a

542
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,460
track and a 600 watt HPS going back and

543
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:17,519
forth at the Times we're like okay we'll

544
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,259
put maybe two or three 20 in here okay

545
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,058
perfect and then so we just you know

546
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:23,339
framed it out custom with that and then

547
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:25,379
the poly with a little stapler stapling

548
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:26,759
it up you seal it you know you cut your

549
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,620
hole where your ventilation is going to

550
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:30,720
be very it's exactly what the tents are

551
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:33,659
today and that's why it's it's crazy too

552
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,038
to see the how easy the kits are you got

553
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,840
the holes in the bottom and you choose

554
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,220
where you want to open up the flaps we

555
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:40,319
were doing the same thing before I even

556
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,660
knew that existed and I'm just like like

557
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,798
wow bro like I'm just so fortunate that

558
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,080
I was taught that way at the beginning

559
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:47,940
and not just throw it in a closet

560
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,279
without you know sealing in some kind of

561
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,660
way having an extractor

562
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:53,460
um you know bringing the fresh air in

563
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,660
not knowing that just planting beans if

564
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,340
that was my experience getting into the

565
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,840
game I think I don't even know if

566
00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:00,298
homegrow TV would be around now it was

567
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,159
really nice to learn the basics so you

568
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:04,019
know it's cool to even see people use a

569
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,460
closet they might not even seal it with

570
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:07,379
black and white sometimes but they do

571
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,579
have an extractor going out they got

572
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,080
things coming and they know no lights

573
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:12,240
going into that room maybe so there's

574
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,339
ways to do it without sealing it but

575
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,960
it's really cheap and simple too to just

576
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:18,298
build whatever frame and size you want

577
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,400
you know get your extractor

578
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:22,918
choose your lights and then boom for the

579
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,200
poly film I think it's also called Panda

580
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:28,020
film I'm not sure if it's a brand Panda

581
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,519
or what but yeah that stuff

582
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:30,839
you know for anyone listening in that's

583
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,298
looking to purchase that stuff there's

584
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:35,038
different sizes of thickness and some

585
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:36,418
are so thin that you can actually hold

586
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:37,859
up to light and you can see the light

587
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:38,820
right through it so you just got to be

588
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:40,798
careful that you're looking at the

589
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:44,038
thickness I think the standard thickness

590
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,240
is five mil I think the happy Hydra

591
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:47,160
actually has the thickest on the market

592
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,079
seven mil so if you're really looking

593
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,880
for a real thick one and a product

594
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:52,859
placement here happy Hydro shout out to

595
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,600
you guys I actually have some of it

596
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:57,298
that's what I used for my closet seven

597
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:59,759
mil thick on that stuff so it's solid

598
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:01,859
now what about lighting what did you use

599
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,419
for lighting back then and taking a look

600
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:05,759
back what do you recommend now for

601
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:07,080
lighting and space like that since back

602
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,019
then the lighting was a lot different

603
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:12,058
than it is today yeah dude HPS was our

604
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:14,519
main go-to for flower back in the day

605
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:16,139
and I love those t5s like I would even

606
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,960
bring them back now just those small

607
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,940
fluorescent little T5 balls were so

608
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,519
cheap and we would get custom and build

609
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,080
panels with like 10 of them on there you

610
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,579
know they would barely you know use up

611
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:27,960
anything and I remember even doing a

612
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:30,240
full grow from seed to harvest with just

613
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,100
those to see and I was like Blown Away

614
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,839
with like oh my God it actually produced

615
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:35,939
nugs as well I thought just HPS was

616
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,079
going to do that but no HPS was really

617
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,000
nice back in the day especially in

618
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:41,279
Canada in the winter bro it gets really

619
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,779
really cold so it was nice to have that

620
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,359
heat

621
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:47,158
um at certain times definitely during

622
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,658
the winter I can't in the summer as well

623
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:50,159
we were in a basement so it was it was

624
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:52,740
nice and cool

625
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,720
and uh yeah the great results but now

626
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,640
like especially with where I live now

627
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,400
and being in Colombia and even if I was

628
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,919
still in Canada LED I just really big

629
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,500
fan of LED because of the heat the

630
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,299
efficiency is so nice there's like

631
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,319
something for everyone's growth style so

632
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:09,240
it's like some people are really into

633
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:11,279
the bars some people love the panels you

634
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,200
know and it's just it's just really cool

635
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,460
to see where it's come and you know

636
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,580
we're always just testing as well

637
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,259
different things here on uh on the

638
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:22,259
channel on homegirl TV and it's just we

639
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:24,058
found some really you know amazing you

640
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:25,558
know just amazing results with I

641
00:21:24,058 --> 00:21:27,960
remember the first time I tried a 200

642
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:29,700
watt LED and I was like I just you know

643
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,079
and in a two by fours which is a great

644
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,519
example and keeping the environment

645
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:34,319
small and it was just 200 Watts the

646
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:35,879
first time I ever tried one I was like I

647
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:39,058
wasn't expecting you know what I see on

648
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:42,299
Instagram these 700 Watts 1000 watt LEDs

649
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:44,460
crazy nugs dude it was unbelievable I

650
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:46,200
was like oh my God it just blew away my

651
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,460
expectations you know if you just have

652
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,500
it dialed in nice and have everything

653
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,600
turned in nice and with those small

654
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,000
tents I find it it's it's easy to dial

655
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,619
in the the perfect settings yeah that's

656
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,720
all you really need for a wattage these

657
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:59,339
days it can be very very low I mean for

658
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,558
a two by two space a lot of people put

659
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:04,199
100 watts of LED in there right you know

660
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:05,879
two by four space 200 Watts now you can

661
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,440
go above and beyond that for sure but

662
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,960
then you could potentially run into heat

663
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,880
issues you know with all that uh energy

664
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,798
consumption being drawn the heat coming

665
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,020
from the diode being in that small space

666
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:19,500
that can be difficult yeah let's get

667
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:21,000
into air exchange air circulation first

668
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,319
what's your ventilation system you

669
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,720
talked a little bit about an extractor

670
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:27,538
fan was there a particular brand fan

671
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,460
you're using to exhaust the air using

672
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:31,679
carbon filter too so on and so forth so

673
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,120
yeah ventilation I think that's a

674
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,500
perfect question for the timing that

675
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,538
I've just recently going through right

676
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,460
now because it was two or three episodes

677
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:40,558
ago on the channel we released something

678
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,538
on powdery mildew it's the first time

679
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:45,839
that's ever happened to me and I got hit

680
00:22:42,538 --> 00:22:47,759
hard on like two of my tents because uh

681
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:50,158
in in Canada I've always took it for

682
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,558
granted we had a much drier Climax and I

683
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,960
remember not having to fight with 80 90

684
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,759
humidities like I have here so I was

685
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,960
like I'm one of my fans broke and this

686
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:00,119
was a

687
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,679
I won't mention the name but it wasn't a

688
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:03,119
brand any of us it was like the cheapest

689
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,038
one I could find on Amazon and extractor

690
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,199
and it broke down I didn't have a

691
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,819
replacement so I connected one tent to

692
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,319
the other tent to the two by four so

693
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:12,000
they would extract both and then go out

694
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,379
so I'm bringing power to mildew from one

695
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,839
into the other which I didn't know and

696
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,299
then it's all on the on the channel on

697
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,819
the episode I learned so much and so I

698
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:23,519
definitely respect more now and is

699
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:25,439
something we all know but I didn't know

700
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,179
the consequences until I was dealing

701
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,400
with powdery mildew now I know it has to

702
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:31,140
be on points and the main one that I'm

703
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,659
absolutely loving is the AC Infinity

704
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:36,480
because of the the monitoring like to

705
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:38,100
get to see the the humidity that's in

706
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,599
there getting to adjust the probe and

707
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:41,759
not having like an external little one

708
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,079
I'm absolutely loving and now having the

709
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:44,759
Bluetooth ones I don't have the Wi-Fi

710
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:46,859
but I have the new Bluetooth and their

711
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:48,119
Advanced setup and it's so cool to be

712
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:50,158
able to see it on my phone have alerts

713
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:51,839
set up and everything so for me that's

714
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,520
my go-to now and I don't think I'll

715
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,720
invest in anything else

716
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,038
um that's not going to be at least at

717
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,659
that level to be able to see now what's

718
00:23:56,038 --> 00:24:00,720
going on monitor for my phone monitor if

719
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:03,600
Amanda event just in case something does

720
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,940
you know totally

721
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,319
have an error stop working which you

722
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,580
know and all the time I've been growing

723
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:10,319
that's the first time a fan ever failed

724
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:13,199
like that but it was enough to totally

725
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:15,720
mess up you know two beautiful tents and

726
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,580
uh yeah dude AC Infinity I'm absolutely

727
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,140
loving them right now and please please

728
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:21,418
everyone listening to this or watching

729
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,500
this don't make the same mistake I do or

730
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,759
I did

731
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,159
um it won't happen again on the channel

732
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,619
but uh yeah take your extraction your

733
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,960
ventilation seriously inside the rooms

734
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:32,219
I've always had clip fans but I've found

735
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,019
a lot of the clip fans I've worked with

736
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,659
in the past or I've used have never had

737
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:38,460
the power I wanted to but I'm finding

738
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:39,840
the new AC Infinity ones which I also

739
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,340
have like they have the oscillating ones

740
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,259
which I'm absolutely loving and the

741
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:44,639
other ones also getting to set the power

742
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:46,319
and controller power for my phone and

743
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,200
everything it's just giving me a whole

744
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,639
new realm of control and like kind of

745
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,259
Freedom so I'm excited to see how that

746
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,059
reflects the grows I'm doing my first

747
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:55,500
test in Harvest with with those setups

748
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:57,599
right now

749
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,740
um but yeah if I don't on the other

750
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,558
tents where I don't have the nice

751
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:03,179
oscillating ACS I'll run you know a nice

752
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:05,700
big from the Home Center like the Home

753
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:08,100
Depot Center a big fan up in the corner

754
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,120
one down below and if I need to maybe

755
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:10,859
another one just to make sure

756
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,019
everything's kind of somewhat dancing in

757
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:15,119
the room not break dancing and getting

758
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:17,759
nuts but just slightly kind of uh just

759
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:20,339
moving back and forth and say no to

760
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:23,579
powdery mildew yeah the air circulation

761
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:25,558
is so undervalued by so many people and

762
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:27,720
a lot of people don't have their fans

763
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:29,579
set up the way they should so their

764
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,159
flows as it should and a lot of people

765
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:34,139
have a real dense canopy so there's hot

766
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,820
spots and human spots and but yeah air

767
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,980
circulation in order for it to get the

768
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:40,200
CO2 that it needs now AC Infinity

769
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:42,360
they've certainly done so much in order

770
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,860
to make things a lot easier for indoor

771
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:46,439
growing right one thing AC Infinity

772
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:49,139
doesn't have though which maybe they'll

773
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,538
have in the future who knows is heating

774
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:54,299
and cooling so some people will run

775
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:55,619
heaters in their environment or some

776
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:58,440
type of air conditioning whether it be

777
00:25:55,619 --> 00:26:01,199
the Standalone ones or the Century City

778
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:04,140
in the house what do you do for heating

779
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,179
and cooling dude yeah and that question

780
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,880
too they I can't wait till they do it

781
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:11,460
because the main question and me as a as

782
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,840
a you know a consumer of AC Infinity I

783
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,000
remember the first time seeing it and

784
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:17,038
making my order on on uh getting my

785
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,659
first inline fan or extractor fan and I

786
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,579
was like is it AC though is it is it

787
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:21,778
producing AC out is it making cold air

788
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,359
and I'm like going on the website I'm

789
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:25,980
like where's the AC in this thing

790
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:27,418
um I would totally didn't know at the

791
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,179
beginning but I can't wait for that to

792
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,799
to come out when I lived in the city of

793
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:34,980
Medellin which right now I'm only about

794
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:36,658
a half hour outside and uh Colombia is

795
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,220
the second most biodiverse country in

796
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:39,840
the world some say it's the first some

797
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,940
say it's the third there's a it's a you

798
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,399
know between Brazil you got Peru here

799
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,919
but it's up there meaning if I drive a

800
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,778
half hour this way it can get a lot

801
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:50,220
hotter and sometimes more humid if I go

802
00:26:48,778 --> 00:26:51,839
half hour that way it can get colder and

803
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,819
I'm like I need I need a jacket on with

804
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:55,678
just a half hour just the elevation it's

805
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:58,139
in the mountains here so just being in

806
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,278
the city where I was a few months ago

807
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,200
eight months ago I think it was back

808
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:03,058
when I lived out there it would get way

809
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,798
too hot in my room so I need needed an

810
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:07,319
AC it would get it would get like 32

811
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,940
which I'm not good at Fahrenheit too hot

812
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:12,298
you know it was a few degrees too hot of

813
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,558
my optimal where I wanted to be and so I

814
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:15,058
would have to run it at night and even

815
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:16,319
running it at night I had to keep my

816
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:18,839
lights low because if not it was just

817
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,639
going to be too warm unless I had AC

818
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,439
moving a half hour to where I live now

819
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,759
it just and this was part of the

820
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,259
decision of why I moved here I was like

821
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,480
okay if I'm gonna take it serious it's

822
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:29,398
gonna be a big investment you know AC

823
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,839
all year with the amount of test rooms

824
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,158
that I want to do and stuff that's going

825
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:34,558
to be pricey if we go half hour over

826
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,080
there here at night it gets cooler it's

827
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,819
cooler here in general it can be a

828
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:40,558
little bit more humid

829
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:42,898
um but right now it's perfect like the

830
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,579
hottest I'll get is 25 degrees and then

831
00:27:42,898 --> 00:27:46,439
I turn them off in the day and it sits

832
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:48,960
at 22. so my range is now like three

833
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,659
degrees on any 10 pretty much from day

834
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,058
to night being able to crank to 100 on

835
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:55,980
the lights that I do want to so I'm

836
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:57,178
really blessed being able to choose like

837
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,179
okay let's just move a little bit over

838
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:01,679
here and kind of control that way so if

839
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,538
I didn't though yeah I would be using AC

840
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,000
and a lot of people here in Columbia use

841
00:28:03,538 --> 00:28:07,500
AC which has its own advantages you know

842
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,200
as far as keeping the humidity down

843
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,000
working in some of those areas I wish

844
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,700
you know maybe I had a curing room with

845
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,659
AC in it that would be really cool goals

846
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,460
you know maybe one day we'll get there

847
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:20,100
just my care room has AC it'll be

848
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,298
amazing but no for now keeping the

849
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:23,819
energy bill as low as possible no

850
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:25,619
heaters no AC one thing I just want to

851
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:27,778
add to that would be for air

852
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:29,879
conditioning that's a concern for a lot

853
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:31,440
of people especially in small spaces you

854
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,960
know closets you're not gonna really

855
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,899
really fit a standalone one of those

856
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,640
portable AC units in your closet uh

857
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:40,500
they're just too big I mean you probably

858
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,538
could but you wouldn't have much space

859
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,038
left for a plant of course it depends on

860
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:45,720
the size of your closet if you had a

861
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:48,058
huge walk-in closet then you could

862
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,860
probably fit in a portable AC but one

863
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:51,778
thing to keep in mind is that they

864
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:54,178
consume so much energy the Standalone

865
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:55,740
portable ones so much energy I had one

866
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:57,600
of those for a while and I was using it

867
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,579
and my energy bill just went through the

868
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:01,980
roof now the window ACS are going to be

869
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:03,898
a little bit more efficient but by far

870
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,700
the central AC is in the house and

871
00:29:03,898 --> 00:29:07,379
that's what I use now is just the

872
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,058
central AC in my house I just lower it

873
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,720
down I'll freeze a little bit if needed

874
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:14,700
yeah but as long as my plants are happy

875
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,740
that is most forgiving on the energy

876
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,778
pill for sure so I just figured I'd add

877
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,460
that in and then for heating one thing I

878
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:22,919
just want to speak about is a lot of

879
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,360
people use those portable heaters and I

880
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:26,520
have one of those tower heaters I use

881
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:28,678
that all the time same thing with your

882
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:31,139
AC is it might not fit in that grow

883
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:33,419
space comfortably but having your

884
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,340
equipment outside of the grow space in

885
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:37,559
your lung room like the room that your

886
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:40,379
closet is in for example if you're

887
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:41,879
controlling the air in that room and

888
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,679
then once you have your exhaust fan on

889
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,080
you're bringing that air in well you're

890
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,120
bringing in the ideal air right the the

891
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:50,220
temperature and humidity that you've

892
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:52,319
been conditioned in your lung room is

893
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,880
coming into your grow room so just

894
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,879
figured I'd mention those few things now

895
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,440
how about humidifier and dehumidifier a

896
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,360
lot of people adjusting the relative

897
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,940
humidity in order to get into that

898
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:05,819
optimal range for plant growth using a

899
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,980
humidifier or dehumidifier at all

900
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:10,379
yeah great points and especially being

901
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,720
in those in in a small tent closet grow

902
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,399
two by four or anything bigger than that

903
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,659
it's you know talking about that last

904
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,278
issue that I did have with the powdery

905
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:19,440
mildew now that'll never happen again

906
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,179
and so talking about the two by fours

907
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,860
for example

908
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,538
again they're sometimes my favorite just

909
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:25,979
because I can control the environment so

910
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:27,720
easily and like I have small

911
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,399
dehumidifiers in every single one of

912
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,778
them just small you know the little

913
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:32,579
portable ones it doesn't hold that much

914
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:34,558
liquid so it would be nice to have a

915
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:36,418
huge one in the main room

916
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:38,339
um but it's just nice to see okay cool

917
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,020
we're getting to this point put a little

918
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:41,339
little portable one inside and it's

919
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:42,658
actually been keeping it in in the

920
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:45,418
perfect range

921
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:46,980
um seeing like 58 to like 66 so if it

922
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:49,679
gets crazy rainy and it's like really

923
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:51,960
really humid which again here I'm used

924
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:56,100
to seeing 80 it could be you know 90

925
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,480
sometimes so dehumidifier all the way

926
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:59,158
um the next big investment will be

927
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,360
getting two of those big ones I'm gonna

928
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:02,278
start with one let's see the difference

929
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,979
on the electricity bill but I'm gonna

930
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:08,700
get one of the big ones because

931
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:10,019
curing is just and drying has been

932
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,940
probably the biggest challenge of

933
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:14,519
growing in a very humid spot because

934
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:16,860
even you keep it good in the room now

935
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:18,538
curing it it's just a whole different

936
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:21,240
thing so if I can control the entire

937
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:22,798
room where all the grow tents are and

938
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,940
keep that at it at a certain range

939
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,519
that's kind of where I want to go and

940
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,019
just have that draining into a bucket

941
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,460
um much lower maintenance instead of

942
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,380
going in the tents every day taking out

943
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,778
the little dehumidifier water and

944
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:36,778
getting getting rid of that

945
00:31:33,778 --> 00:31:38,339
so yeah definitely um dehumidifiers here

946
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:40,619
I wish I had the problem to have to use

947
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:42,720
humidifiers like you have right that's

948
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:44,099
what you have and the complete opposite

949
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,200
of you I've never had to run a

950
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:49,319
dehumidifier because my natural humidity

951
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,179
is like 30 now looking at it right yeah

952
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:53,278
it's exactly at 30 right now I'm looking

953
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:56,159
at my monitor and winter time it gets

954
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:58,919
even crazier it's like 19 18 so it's

955
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,539
like super dry here which increases

956
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:02,460
transpiration and plant growth it could

957
00:32:00,538 --> 00:32:05,099
actually be a negative thing in some

958
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,500
cases so I actually have a humidifier so

959
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:10,259
I add in humidity now one thing I will

960
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,700
say about humidifiers is those will you

961
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:13,558
know you can shove one of those in a

962
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,620
small grow space either a small grow

963
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:18,178
space or a closet space levolt is the

964
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:19,739
brand that I've been using now and it's

965
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:22,919
way better than anything else I've ever

966
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:25,319
used this one is a top fill so you can

967
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:27,059
actually just take off the top load up

968
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,259
the water without having to like some of

969
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:30,259
the other tanks you have to like take

970
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:33,000
off the whole thing flip it upside down

971
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:34,379
unscrew it then pour it in it's like you

972
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,119
don't have to do anything that one of

973
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,159
your episodes that was that was really

974
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:39,839
cool dude it makes it easier I know it's

975
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,000
like seems like a small feature to some

976
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:44,538
people but it's like it's it's just the

977
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,679
convenience factor it's great

978
00:32:44,538 --> 00:32:48,179
it's connected to your smartphone as

979
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:50,278
well so you get notifications when it's

980
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:52,500
out or when it needs to be cleaned which

981
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:54,058
is really cool so I love that one and

982
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,740
the tank I think is like a gallon and a

983
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:57,599
half so it's larger than a lot of the

984
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,880
other tanks on the markets so I can't

985
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:02,158
recommend that brand enough I did have a

986
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,720
leaking issue with one of them but I

987
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,039
think I just cleaned it and then now it

988
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,480
doesn't leak anymore so I don't know

989
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:09,599
what happened there but uh yeah full

990
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,380
disclosure yeah no thing looks solid and

991
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,778
that's kind of like the difference

992
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,640
between the dehumidifier

993
00:33:12,778 --> 00:33:16,380
um and the small one the disadvantage

994
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,759
taking it out every day two days if you

995
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,919
forget about it just gonna turn off stop

996
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,359
taking out the the humidity compared to

997
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,220
if I had a bigger one I'm running the

998
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,898
hose it's going into the bucket there's

999
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,759
some things it really is making the work

1000
00:33:24,898 --> 00:33:29,038
that it's worth making the jump for and

1001
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:30,778
investing like we think about LEDs as

1002
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:32,819
being just the main thing or okay then

1003
00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:34,859
we'll think about our tent but man yeah

1004
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:36,240
it's like it's not fun fun but sometimes

1005
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:37,740
you're gonna have to draw up you know

1006
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,079
depending on where you live in your

1007
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,940
situation on something like that it

1008
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:43,740
isn't the most exciting but man is it

1009
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,019
going to make It's Gonna Save so many

1010
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,819
headaches and just save you you know

1011
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:49,440
just better buds

1012
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:51,178
yeah I completely agree and that's why

1013
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,860
most of the episodes so far just what

1014
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:54,778
the entire episode has been on the the

1015
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:56,879
space and the actual equipment that goes

1016
00:33:54,778 --> 00:33:59,278
into space I do want to transition over

1017
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,019
now to actual growing the plants in that

1018
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,839
small space and I think I want to start

1019
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:06,419
with the container size right you're in

1020
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:09,119
a small space what size containers do

1021
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:10,740
did you run in your small closet grow

1022
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,940
and I guess what size would you

1023
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:14,759
recommend

1024
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,079
so yeah I started and we I remember back

1025
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,339
in Canada it was cool I haven't seen

1026
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,659
these or used these since but this was

1027
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:20,338
like back when it was like remember just

1028
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,320
the plastic bags they were disposable

1029
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:23,699
bags kind of like the grow bags material

1030
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,019
we have now reusable these were like

1031
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:27,719
just plastic and we were using one

1032
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:29,338
gallon sea of green but nowadays

1033
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,898
especially having a plant limit and

1034
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:33,358
that's often a conversation you know

1035
00:34:30,898 --> 00:34:34,799
depending on where you're growing you

1036
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:37,440
know or what the medicinal plant limit

1037
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,419
is on where you are here it's 20 right

1038
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,039
so I never want to go above that and I

1039
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:43,199
usually want to say a few you know below

1040
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:46,378
just to in case I want to cut a clone or

1041
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,658
just have room to be able to play so the

1042
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:50,759
size I often do now you know and I

1043
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:52,740
always still like to you know know that

1044
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,119
big Roots big fruits so as big as we can

1045
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:56,459
go

1046
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:58,380
um in the smallest of testing size three

1047
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,880
gallon just to see certain strains how

1048
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,039
they're gonna produce in a three gallon

1049
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,539
and that's in a two by four small setup

1050
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:06,119
I'll put either two or three in there

1051
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:07,980
and if I put three uh three gallons in

1052
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:09,960
then I'm Gonna Leave vegim Out you know

1053
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,519
not as long you know four weeks maybe

1054
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,858
and then kick them over whereas if I

1055
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:16,619
have just two I could veg him out for

1056
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:18,059
maybe eight you know six if we wanted to

1057
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:19,858
just get into it and then have more room

1058
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:21,358
in in there so I've done both and we

1059
00:35:19,858 --> 00:35:22,619
have several episodes on the Channel

1060
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:24,480
showing both what it's like to have

1061
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,980
three what it's like to have two using

1062
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,599
three gallons

1063
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,219
um but some of the other favorite ones

1064
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,079
and a lot of people actually make fun of

1065
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:33,419
me too of this one but in a nice way I

1066
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:34,560
also kind of laugh at it I use what's

1067
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,820
available and one of the first things

1068
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:37,858
available when I first started growing

1069
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:41,039
again in Colombia was five gallon paint

1070
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:42,900
buckets so like you know but like not

1071
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,338
used with paint so there's no toxicities

1072
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,960
or anything you just go buy a paint

1073
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:47,159
bucket it's like three bucks or

1074
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,300
something I was like oh it's so much

1075
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:49,679
better than going to the gardening store

1076
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,140
they're like 10 bucks or something here

1077
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,239
it's like this luxurious one and so I

1078
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:56,098
just got a bunch of these five gallons

1079
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:57,299
drilled holes in them and it was nice

1080
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,980
because they were a little bit taller

1081
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,619
and if I wanted to see a green I could

1082
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:03,599
fit a bit more you know into into that

1083
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:05,460
into that size

1084
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,500
um and then the biggest is 11 gallons

1085
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,599
and that's when like you know in a five

1086
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,519
by five I can have five of these 11

1087
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,619
gallons and veg them out for eight weeks

1088
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,659
make them big you know if you want to

1089
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:18,000
keep it to 20 plans can't do A C green

1090
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:20,699
of 40. let's do five big ones you know

1091
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,079
in in four separate rooms you know so

1092
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:24,539
that's what I've also tested that's on

1093
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,400
the biggest end is 12 gallons none of it

1094
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:28,320
fabric yet but right now we're testing

1095
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,420
two tents a two by four and a four by

1096
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,280
four with all fabric pots and that's

1097
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,260
from basement autoflowers homie that has

1098
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,640
this fabric pots with the option to

1099
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,920
train your plants which you know we'll

1100
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:39,539
talk about talk about later

1101
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,480
um so I'm again and there's the

1102
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:44,099
differences there I like the non fabric

1103
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,079
because I started with that when I first

1104
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:47,760
got back into Columbia and I just found

1105
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,980
if it's not the right quality you're

1106
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,240
going to get leaking everywhere it dries

1107
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,858
out quicker you just have to be ready

1108
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:54,358
for the difference between growing in a

1109
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:56,039
fabric pot

1110
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:57,719
um and I found sometimes if you're away

1111
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:00,119
from the house an extra day or if you

1112
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:02,399
might miss a feed having the non-fabric

1113
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:03,539
just kept it uh kept the the moisture a

1114
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,220
little bit longer

1115
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:06,420
and it was just something I just got

1116
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:09,000
used to the timing of when they were

1117
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,380
going to water and everything so now

1118
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,659
we're going to be testing uh yeah

1119
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,940
Fabrics I think we got three gallons and

1120
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:17,098
five gallons I'm not sure I gotta double

1121
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,420
check it might just be five gallons but

1122
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:21,480
we're testing those right now as well

1123
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,700
okay yeah there are Pros so many pros

1124
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,740
and cons to running smaller containers

1125
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:27,179
versus larger containers I mean if

1126
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:30,239
you're running one gallon containers and

1127
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:32,159
you're you're small grow tent or grows

1128
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:33,598
the space or closet

1129
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:36,179
um then you have a whole bunch of plants

1130
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,039
to water if the plant is Big it might

1131
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:39,659
dry out the medium faster so you have to

1132
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:41,099
water more often versus if you're

1133
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:42,539
running a larger container say three

1134
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:44,220
gallons or five gallons maybe you have

1135
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:46,800
to water less frequently you know what I

1136
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:48,299
mean so that's just one of many pros and

1137
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,820
cons to it we could sit here for the

1138
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,160
next 30 minutes and talk about container

1139
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:55,740
size but uh I don't really want to do

1140
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:57,598
that but you did mention training and I

1141
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:59,338
want to get deeper into that next

1142
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,079
playing training staying in a small

1143
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:03,179
space staying in a closet some people

1144
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:05,220
need to train their plants to keep them

1145
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:07,379
small also those stay within that space

1146
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:09,959
what do you typically do for plants

1147
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,160
training when you're in a small space or

1148
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,960
closet

1149
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:14,519
yeah I think yeah you nailed it it

1150
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,260
totally depends again on the space and

1151
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:18,000
talking about our small spaces first a

1152
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:21,119
two by four to make the most out of our

1153
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,159
two by four there's so many the way I

1154
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,858
see it and I've gone to the extreme of

1155
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:27,358
being the over trainer right like I've

1156
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:29,400
done it and I've over trained the lady

1157
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:30,659
and it's like week 10 veg and she's like

1158
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,940
just short and there's like a hundred

1159
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:34,199
things and I've gone the opposite and

1160
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,119
I'm like let's just don't don't touch

1161
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:38,639
anything and let her go through and I

1162
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:40,140
found now I find you're you're in a

1163
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:41,219
balance and you understand the plans a

1164
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:42,838
little bit more especially when you know

1165
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:44,399
this train I think it's always fun too

1166
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:45,960
the first time growing out a strain if

1167
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,740
you can just let it grow naturally to

1168
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,240
see

1169
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:49,439
that's great if you don't have the time

1170
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:50,879
you want to get right to training but I

1171
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,338
think there's a few basic things talking

1172
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,200
about a small girl that we should do the

1173
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:57,119
most basic and the first thing would

1174
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:59,939
definitely be uh topping you know just

1175
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:02,160
to not have one branch and if I have an

1176
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,300
extra two weeks that I want to veg for I

1177
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:04,559
love to top

1178
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,599
um and that way at least I'm dealing

1179
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,099
with Four Tops I've have some episodes

1180
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:10,920
where it looks like we have just 10

1181
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:12,539
amazing colas and that's from one single

1182
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,559
topping that we did depending on the

1183
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:18,179
strain right some I like to let's say

1184
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:19,920
you know if you want to delay it a

1185
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:21,358
little bit and let's say it's all on

1186
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,220
timing I like to kick the next garden

1187
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:24,539
over when that one's halfway done right

1188
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:26,338
to always kind of keep things you always

1189
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:27,659
got a consistent Harvest coming in at a

1190
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:28,920
certain time so I'm like okay I want to

1191
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:30,598
keep vegging these an extra two weeks

1192
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,000
let's train them a little bit more let's

1193
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:35,160
do a little bit of LST now right we

1194
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,900
always pretty much do the topping but

1195
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:39,000
right now I kind of living in that

1196
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,559
flexible area my two by fours of just

1197
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,358
how quick do I want to flip this over

1198
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,039
into flower okay I know I have about

1199
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:46,319
four weeks all right let's take our time

1200
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:48,539
definitely do one topping and then from

1201
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,980
there LST here to just make sure she's

1202
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:51,179
not going to stretch too close to the

1203
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,760
light

1204
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:55,440
um you know that's I don't know in a

1205
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,359
small space this happens to a lot of us

1206
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,500
if it it's going to happen at some point

1207
00:39:57,358 --> 00:39:59,519
in your life it's already happened or

1208
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,099
it's gonna happen in the future where

1209
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:04,199
you over veg a plant or a veg a plant's

1210
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:05,940
gonna over stretch and in a small space

1211
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:07,858
you always have to keep in mind if you

1212
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,960
don't know that that genetic or what she

1213
00:40:07,858 --> 00:40:11,338
acts like you know treat her like she's

1214
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,380
probably gonna stretch a lot play it on

1215
00:40:11,338 --> 00:40:15,239
the safe end and don't vegger out too

1216
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,400
long trainer so she's you know you got

1217
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:19,559
yourself some good playroom just in case

1218
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,300
she stretches a foot and you're still

1219
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:23,940
you know good at least six inches away

1220
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:26,039
from from the light if someone does make

1221
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:28,079
that mistake of over vegging their

1222
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:29,400
plants or maybe they think they veg a

1223
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,200
good amount of time but then they flip

1224
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,420
over to the flowering like cycle and

1225
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:35,460
they get that two three weeks of stretch

1226
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,318
and then they're really outgrowing that

1227
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,699
space What are some things that they

1228
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:40,380
should do

1229
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:42,779
perfect yeah that's a great question

1230
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:45,300
that just happened here recently I'm the

1231
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,940
type of guy that always has his his uh

1232
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:50,039
his fan and carbon filter in the room up

1233
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,780
top and so the first time this happened

1234
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:53,159
I was like oh my God like really soon

1235
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,380
these are going to get too close so

1236
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,699
first step let's get the fan outside the

1237
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,920
room the carbon filter out the room get

1238
00:40:56,699 --> 00:41:00,299
the lights as high as you can so get

1239
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,680
everything out of the room like as far

1240
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,940
as ventilation that you can on the

1241
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:04,980
outside of your extractor that kind of

1242
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:07,079
stuff extract from the outside pull out

1243
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,760
you know push it outside

1244
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:10,140
um that's the first thing and let's say

1245
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,400
you've done that or let's say you don't

1246
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:13,259
have the option two and now no matter

1247
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,180
what you're gonna hit it depending on

1248
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,619
where you are uh

1249
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:18,179
you know you can do a really late

1250
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:20,760
topping you know there's a lot of people

1251
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:21,960
who are very don't stress you're going

1252
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,240
into flower you've already started

1253
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,559
flower don't do that if you have to you

1254
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:26,879
have to and if you like you you're

1255
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:28,739
already week one flower you're seeing

1256
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,519
what's going on take her off because if

1257
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:30,719
not you're going to run into your

1258
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:32,460
problem she's going to be touching the

1259
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:34,739
light you're going to be crying she's

1260
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:36,420
she's stressing out so that's one thing

1261
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:38,879
if you're early enough to to be able to

1262
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,720
to clip her out

1263
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,338
um

1264
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:43,559
I had another one I wanted to share

1265
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:44,880
there I've had to take plants out in

1266
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:46,318
fully she was just going to get too big

1267
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,358
she was already too late in the flower

1268
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:50,940
to start taking buds off so I really I

1269
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:53,219
had to start over again you know on that

1270
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:55,019
strain and that was really unfortunate

1271
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,338
so yeah I would say to take out your

1272
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:57,780
ventilation what you can raise the

1273
00:41:56,338 --> 00:41:59,159
heights as much as you can and then

1274
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,660
early oh and that was the last thing

1275
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:02,098
sorry so again if you're all still a

1276
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:04,078
little bit early in that in that flower

1277
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:06,960
and you're seeing a lot of stretch on

1278
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,579
the main stretchers if you need to do a

1279
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,199
little bit of LST just a little bit to

1280
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:11,818
slow her down you know like if she's

1281
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:13,858
gonna you see you're going right up and

1282
00:42:11,818 --> 00:42:16,739
if you have to take those two top four

1283
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:18,358
whatever suckers just you know slow them

1284
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:20,098
down just a little bit with a little bit

1285
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:21,659
of low stress training and then that

1286
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:22,859
hopefully should even out the rest of

1287
00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:25,078
them will start to come up and you'll

1288
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:26,940
have more of an even kind of canopy I go

1289
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:28,440
as far as even super cropping you know

1290
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,358
when I get those branches that just come

1291
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,220
up and just actually it's a form of high

1292
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:33,299
stress train technically is have that

1293
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:34,739
thing flop over and then the other

1294
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,180
branches will kind of catch up that's a

1295
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:37,799
good call though but yeah I've had a

1296
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,118
handful of people over the years that

1297
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,500
have sent me pictures and like I'm

1298
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,720
running out of space and they just have

1299
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,639
that one branch coming up and it's like

1300
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:46,199
super close to the light and I tell them

1301
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:47,818
I'm like you may want to sacrifice that

1302
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:49,679
branch and they don't even think about

1303
00:42:47,818 --> 00:42:51,179
it you know you definitely can you

1304
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:53,759
already mentioned this you definitely

1305
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:55,019
can top that remove that branch and

1306
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,119
that's actually going to help the other

1307
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:58,318
branches that are lower right because if

1308
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,000
you have this one branch coming up and

1309
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:01,619
it's too close to the light you could

1310
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,119
stretch out into the plant so much and

1311
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:05,160
I've done this before to where it starts

1312
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,440
throwing out nanners you know it's just

1313
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:09,719
it's too much light stress it starts

1314
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,519
throwing out dinners so cutting that

1315
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:13,679
Branch off well then maybe the rest of

1316
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,599
the branches are going to now grow just

1317
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:16,739
fine because you sacrifice that one

1318
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,960
branch so a lot of people don't think of

1319
00:43:16,739 --> 00:43:21,299
that you bring up a great Point yeah it

1320
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,460
just and a lot of the photos we take on

1321
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,500
homegroups video for Instagram sometimes

1322
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,760
we take it at a point in the plant's

1323
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,920
life where she's not ready for Harvest

1324
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,780
but she looks the best for photo so

1325
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,099
we'll cut her and then we'll take the

1326
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,560
pictures and then we leave the plant

1327
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:36,359
maybe to flower at Max on one strand we

1328
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:37,440
push for another two weeks and

1329
00:43:36,358 --> 00:43:38,699
interestingly enough now that you say

1330
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,838
that now I remember going back and we

1331
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,338
looked at it after and it's like we

1332
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:43,679
never took anything off we're like oh my

1333
00:43:41,338 --> 00:43:45,299
god look Everything Is Beautiful even

1334
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:48,000
though two weeks ago a week ago we took

1335
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:50,460
off you know our beautiful our catalog

1336
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,739
one the rest now are like wow of all

1337
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:54,300
matured so yeah I think yeah you don't

1338
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:55,858
have to be where if you got to take off

1339
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,839
a big one now you bring that up I've

1340
00:43:55,858 --> 00:43:59,818
done it for photography and yeah she uh

1341
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:02,699
she will still mature nice yeah

1342
00:43:59,818 --> 00:44:04,500
absolutely how about watering is there

1343
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:06,059
anything that you do in particular when

1344
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,519
you're Watering your plants you know

1345
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:11,099
specific to closet growing specific to

1346
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:13,380
Classic growing not so much

1347
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:14,940
um if I had to relate it too I do keep

1348
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,740
my reservoirs obviously a little bit

1349
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:19,079
smaller and let's talk reservoirs I

1350
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:21,598
think you know for per tent because

1351
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:23,280
um as a home grower whether you have a

1352
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,200
small closet grow whether you have a 4x4

1353
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,220
5x5 you know a ten by five whatever it

1354
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:27,179
is

1355
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:28,679
um everyone's gonna have a different way

1356
00:44:27,179 --> 00:44:31,139
of feeding it so what we do at home grow

1357
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:32,879
TV with our water at least is we do a

1358
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:35,400
reservoir we dechlorinate 24 hours

1359
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,780
before at least and a small closet grow

1360
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,519
depending on the plants I don't want to

1361
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,319
leave my water out in the reservoir for

1362
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:43,019
you know for too long so I like to just

1363
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:45,358
monitor it and I use those same five

1364
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:48,420
gallon buckets leave it out for 24 hours

1365
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:50,699
before usually ten percent of what the

1366
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:52,619
the pot is is what I'm giving it you

1367
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:54,598
know for water and I'm moving now almost

1368
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:56,460
to like almost daily where I'm almost

1369
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:58,140
testing this with a few small gardens

1370
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:59,639
and just watering them kind of daily

1371
00:44:58,139 --> 00:45:01,858
smaller amounts

1372
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:03,900
so no big difference but what I will say

1373
00:45:01,858 --> 00:45:05,338
and something exciting coming up I don't

1374
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,318
know if it's going to be great or if

1375
00:45:05,338 --> 00:45:09,838
it's going to be just totally not

1376
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:11,880
relevant to plants but there's an

1377
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:13,019
alkaline or it's just it doesn't have to

1378
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,260
be alkaline but there's a water filter

1379
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:18,539
that I used to use just as a person not

1380
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,099
for growing and this is basically allows

1381
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:22,199
me to control the pH that comes out of

1382
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:25,019
the machine all the way from you know I

1383
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:26,399
can choose 11 to pH 2.5 so I think

1384
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:28,019
there's going to be some exciting stuff

1385
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,019
in the future for homegirl TV and

1386
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:33,420
experimenting stuff with water

1387
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:34,800
everything from extracts to you know to

1388
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,480
watering our plants and seeing the

1389
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,640
difference is really something going on

1390
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,099
cloning stuff like that but no as of

1391
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,199
right now I'm very typical take out your

1392
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:45,420
water 24 hours dechlorinate small little

1393
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,399
Reservoir and yeah do that probably

1394
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:49,019
about twice a week all right pretty

1395
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,880
straightforward stuff there so we are

1396
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:52,858
coming up towards the end of the episode

1397
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,019
and one of the questions I like to ask

1398
00:45:52,858 --> 00:45:57,358
on most episodes is get a good device

1399
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:59,219
for beginners so what advice do you have

1400
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:00,960
for those that are new to closet growing

1401
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:03,480
so yeah I know great question I think

1402
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,240
advice for new Growers getting into

1403
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:08,039
small closet grows maybe just small tent

1404
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:10,318
grows two by four two by two whatever

1405
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:12,838
that may be I would say definitely keep

1406
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:14,519
it simple don't over complicate it and

1407
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:17,159
get started taking it one step at a time

1408
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:18,300
meaning if you don't have everything in

1409
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:19,500
your budget right now to get the

1410
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,300
dehumidifier we may have talked about

1411
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:24,000
today to get the humidifier that you may

1412
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,680
need maybe you need to start off with

1413
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,900
um you know not your most ideal light

1414
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,719
that you want to choose get your kit get

1415
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:33,059
going don't over complicate it

1416
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:35,818
um and I would also say as a side piece

1417
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:36,960
to that is follow if there if you don't

1418
00:46:35,818 --> 00:46:38,880
have a grow bro that's going to take you

1419
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,559
through this step by step I would follow

1420
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,940
someone who has the results that you're

1421
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:43,980
looking to achieve whether that's

1422
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:46,079
someone who has a grow Journal seed to

1423
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,059
harvest online whether that's watching

1424
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,160
Mr gowitz content someone who's done it

1425
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:51,960
proven the concept and follow that step

1426
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:53,699
by step don't lose yourself in the

1427
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,500
information of what nutrients what

1428
00:46:53,699 --> 00:46:58,199
genetics what light

1429
00:46:55,500 --> 00:47:00,539
get going have fun with it and then

1430
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:02,279
because after your first two grows

1431
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:04,559
every you know then you can start making

1432
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,660
decisions your own choices and and kind

1433
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:08,279
of play it from there but yeah I would

1434
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:10,318
just say keep it simple and start having

1435
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,660
fun growing in a small nice nice little

1436
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:15,119
closet grow definitely keep it simple I

1437
00:47:12,659 --> 00:47:16,559
mean I know people who grow in a closet

1438
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,519
they just have a light in there and

1439
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:18,900
that's it they don't even have any

1440
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,239
ventilation they don't even have air

1441
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:23,039
circulation they just keep the closet

1442
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:24,899
door open and they have a fan blowing

1443
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:26,699
towards the closet door and the plants

1444
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,800
still grow exactly they can certainly

1445
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:31,739
get away with it you just might not get

1446
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,300
the most optimal dance buds you know

1447
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:35,639
that you're looking for but you'll still

1448
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,260
get a harvest off of it so I like your

1449
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:38,639
advice there when you talk about keeping

1450
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,740
it simple because we did spend a lot of

1451
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:42,358
time here talking about environment and

1452
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:43,679
the equipment in order to automate the

1453
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:45,719
environment because it it's very

1454
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:48,058
important but you can certainly get away

1455
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:50,578
with not having a lot of those things

1456
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:52,619
exactly so wrapping things up how can

1457
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:54,839
the listeners find you and what do you

1458
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:57,780
have upcoming in the future awesome dude

1459
00:47:54,838 --> 00:48:00,239
well you can find us on homegrow TV on

1460
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:02,960
YouTube just home grow TV also on

1461
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:05,818
Instagram am same thing home grow TV

1462
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,260
and I think the future is where it gets

1463
00:48:05,818 --> 00:48:08,759
really exciting because yeah right now

1464
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,559
we're known for a lot of seed to harvest

1465
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,880
videos we do do lives meaning we're

1466
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:14,339
going live right after this here on

1467
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,900
homegirl TV's Channel we do interviews

1468
00:48:14,338 --> 00:48:17,699
not nearly as much as you brother you're

1469
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,318
a master at that and we learned so much

1470
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:20,699
from watching your stuff it's

1471
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:22,440
you know we've done a few breeders here

1472
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:25,679
and there but where is homegirl TV going

1473
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,119
is I think to that documentary shorts

1474
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:29,039
film

1475
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,720
um showing Columbia showing the Breeders

1476
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:33,539
kind of like that Strain Hunters what we

1477
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:35,098
got to see back in 2013 I think is when

1478
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:36,900
that that kind of came out that Strain

1479
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:38,579
Hunters area that documentary style of

1480
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,980
the story The Growers the people where

1481
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:42,599
did our land races really come from

1482
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,039
um getting to meet these these kind of

1483
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:46,079
families who have been doing it you know

1484
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:48,420
from generations to Generations here and

1485
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,859
that's all they know that's what gets me

1486
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,539
really fired up

1487
00:48:49,858 --> 00:48:53,639
um and also those tours so getting to

1488
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:56,818
see being here in Columbia I really feel

1489
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:58,318
like in five years you know what

1490
00:48:56,818 --> 00:48:59,759
Columbia will be known for will be

1491
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:01,318
totally different than what they have

1492
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,240
been known for over the last 20 years

1493
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:04,318
because of the movement of what's

1494
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:06,179
Happening Here with this beautiful

1495
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:08,579
medicinal plant it's it's unbelievable

1496
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:10,980
the attention it's getting so to be here

1497
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:13,380
and to not be telling that story of some

1498
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:15,659
major you know players down here I think

1499
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,220
it would just be would just be silly so

1500
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:18,779
that's what you can look forward to in

1501
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:20,519
the future with homegirl TV some

1502
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,260

1503
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:24,059
tours of some beautiful facilities and

1504
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,440
and uh some families that have been

1505
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:27,480
living it for Generation to generation

1506
