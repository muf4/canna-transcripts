00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,680
know me my name is chris aka mr growit

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,519
and you're watching my extras channel

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:10,800
happy hydro sent me over the chilled

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:12,399
tech x6 600 watt led grow light

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,320
and in this video i'm going to unboxy in

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,160
it i'm going to test the power output

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,600
and i'm going to do a heat test on it

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,719
i'm not going to go over all the specs

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,920
that this grow light has

11
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,439
but i will leave a link in the

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,800
description section below so you can

13
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,118
learn more about it

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,640
this light is shipped into two boxes one

15
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,719
of the boxes has the fixture

16
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,640
and the other box has everything else

17
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:34,000
let's open up the smaller box first

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,159
first thing out the box is a power cord

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,480
next out the box is this bag which has

20
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:41,679
the dimmer and the small white box

21
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:44,000
and also four rope ratchet hangers

22
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,280
and this box is the driver they use a

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,719
meanwell 600h

24
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,879
driver the invoices in the box

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,399
and lastly they've included two chilled

26
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,799
tech stickers

27
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,120
the next box only has the fixture in it

28
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,799
and the fixture is wrapped in a plastic

29
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,399
bag

30
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,839
for the par test i'm going to use the

31
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,400
apogee mq620 extended range par meter

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,920
this meter measures from 340 nanometers

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,240
to 1040 nanometers

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,680
and the measurements are in ppfd if this

35
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,319
your first time watching my part test

36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,840
videos

37
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,839
i do them just to give you a general

38
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,079
idea of what the par output is

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,680
they're not meant to be 100 accurate i

40
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,039
take measurements in group tense which

41
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,799
have reflective walls

42
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,040
that could increase the numbers so just

43
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,320
keep that in mind this led roller has a

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,479
coverage area of

45
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,519
four feet by four feet and i'm taking

46
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,000
measurements in a

47
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,519
four foot by four foot grow tent this

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,078
light does have a dimmer on it

49
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,798
i'll set the light to 100 for the par

50
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:38,158
test

51
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,079
okay i've plugged the light into my

52
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,600
kilowatt meter and i've adjusted the

53
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:42,319
dimmer all the way down to the lowest

54
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,679
setting

55
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:48,879
and it shows 0.45 amps pulling

56
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,040
about 46 watts from the wall now i've

57
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,478
adjusted the dimmer up to 100

58
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,280
and it shows 5.1 amps pulling

59
00:01:54,478 --> 00:02:09,840
600 watts from the wall all right let's

60
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:09,840
get into the measurements
