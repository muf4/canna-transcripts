1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,520
coming up on garden talk with native

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,879
soil it really has very low organic

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:11,119
matter and it's more mineral content and

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,759
that is what our nutrients are so

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,079
implementing native soil is really a way

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,519
of just unlocking like a savings account

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,839
of nutrients

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,719
rice holes are amazing for aeration

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:25,920
instead of pumice or vermiculite because

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:29,198
rice holes hold water they break down

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,079
and they are 90 silica worms are

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,399
resilient i left my worms for a year one

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,399
time i forgot that i had a whole tote of

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,239
worms and i went out there and they were

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,719
still alive a year later i didn't even

16
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,959
touch them 40 of all landfills could be

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,640
composted at home instead of throwing

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,920
your food away in the trash where it's

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,160
going to get buried in a piece of

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,079
plastic in a landfill turn into methane

21
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,000
contribute to greenhouse gas emissions

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,960
you fed your plant with it you're saving

and prior to getting into the industry i

127
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,160

and i've just applied that to my life

134
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,080
and really trying to

135
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,360
educate my community and how we can just

136
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,599
be better humans living alongside plants

137
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,720

138
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,320

139
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,720

00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:24,159
grower outdoor do you grow in beds

141
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,360
containers greenhouse what do you do so

142
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,000
i learned how to grow inside um i had a

143
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,280
medical business back in medical days in

144
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,279
california

145
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,879
and i mean

146
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:38,079
this was

147
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:40,399
the typical indoor synthetic like my

148
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,159
partner just taught me

149
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,758
use a bottle this is what you do follow

150
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,000
a recipe all the grow bro stuff and at

151
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,080
the time i was in college

152
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,879
and i was learning about

153
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,719
sustainable agriculture and ecosystems

154
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,120
and how

155
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,680
everything is connected and i thought

156
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,079
this is a little strange you know like

157
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,478
my lifestyle is all organic and here i

158
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,519
am growing inside when i'm in california

159
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,359
which is

160
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,159
you know the

161
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,520
number one in the nation for agriculture

162
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,319
outside

163
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,879
so

164
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,720
when prop 64 passed i was actually

165
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,319
forced to move in order to keep my

166
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,280
business legal

167
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,400
and i moved down

168
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:27,359
uh the hill outside of tahoe to grow and

169
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,959
change my whole style to outdoor growing

170
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,160
and it was the best thing that happened

171
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,159
to me because

172
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,800
i am so happy i am not under grow lights

173
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,280
anymore

174
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,038
being outside in the sun is amazing i

175
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,918
grow in native soil i'm a huge proponent

176
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,839
of

177
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:46,799
closed-loop systems regenerative

178
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,638
agriculture and using what you have

179
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,919
on your land

180
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,240
to benefit

181
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,439
you the most without having to use a lot

182
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,759
of money

183
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,839
inputs and just trying to keep it as low

184
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,840
cost and efficient as possible cool yeah

185
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,079
so we're going to get into the diy type

186
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,119
stuff today like i mentioned earlier one

187
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,879
of the things i want to start with which

188
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,918
i thought was super cool was on your

189
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:10,000
instagram you have this diy rooting

190
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,519
hormone it's on your instagram story can

191
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,959
you talk to us about that real quick

192
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:19,839
yeah basically um i kind of like to go

193
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,839
through all of the most popular

194
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,160
growing

195
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,199
products and look and see what their

196
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,439
active ingredient is and try and find

197
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,400
that and do a cost analysis of what

198
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:34,719
everyone's most popular um you know so

199
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:38,799
for rooting hormone it is clonex is what

200
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,840
i used and uh indole-3-butric acid is

201
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,800
the active ingredient and this is in

202
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,478
the auxin hormone group for plants and

203
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,879
so that's responsible for cell

204
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,318
elongation and is typically associated

205
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,919
with root growth

206
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,639
um and that is found in most common

207
00:07:53,918 --> 00:08:00,719
rooting hormones and so i just did a

208
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,840
little research and i found a 99 percent

209
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,840
pure

210
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:07,519
um indole 3

211
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,478
connected with potassium um and that was

212
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,959
about

213
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,360
27 i believe

214
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,239
for um

215
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,879
a ton i mean this is pure this is like i

216
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,960
think it was five grams um

217
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:25,599
and it worked out to be

218
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:26,959
a dollar 37 per 200 milliliters

219
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,519
versus

220
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,799
clonex which is 30 for the same

221
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,120
proportion

222
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,038
so you're literally saving you know

223
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,080
you can use that i'll probably have that

224
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,519
little bag for the next five years yeah

225
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,919
it's so awesome that you're able to kind

226
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,679
of save money that way yeah i saw it

227
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,199
with the 200 milliliters is what your

228
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,079
mixture kind of came out to is point

229
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,200
five percent iba and then the comparison

230
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,480
was 100 milliliters of clonex 0.31

231
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,040
so it's less

232
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,039
iba than what you're making and you're

233
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:00,000
paying a lot more than thirty dollars

234
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:03,519
per so where can they get that ipa

235
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,799
um if you go to powergrown.com

236
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,039
they are a company out of sacramento and

237
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,359
they provide all different kinds of

238
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:15,278
plant hormones um and things that you

239
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,278
can purchase from them uh in bulk powder

240
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:19,519
that you just mix yourself and so with

241
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,919
this powder specifically

242
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,320
you're gonna want to just make enough

243
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,439
for what you're going to use okay that

244
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,080
makes sense

245
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,000
nice yeah good little grow hack there

246
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,200
quick grow hack save some of you guys

247
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,759
some money out there i know there's a

248
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,399
ton of people watching that love the diy

249
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,519
style stuff and saving money so that's

250
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,480
pretty cool

251
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,839
let's flip it up let's talk about ipm

252
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,320
you know i've seen your instagram you

253
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,399
grow these massive plants outdoors

254
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,080
i'm mostly an indoor grower i'm not sure

255
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,799
if you're aware that i've very little

256
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,278
outdoor experience indoors outdoors

257
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,599
completely different battlefields right

258
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,120
um when we talk about ipm i mean there's

259
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,200
several grows that i've been through

260
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,720
indoors where i haven't done any ipm you

261
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,240
know what i mean you got to get away

262
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,000
with it sometimes if you have as long as

263
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,079
you're cleaning your grower in between

264
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,440
and so on and so forth outdoors is a

265
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,519
completely different battlefield when

266
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,360
you're growing outdoors

267
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,600
what do you usually do what's your ipm

268
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,079
routine the first

269
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,000
step in ipm for outside is really just

270
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,479
letting go of the expectation that

271
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,919
you're not going to have pests because

272
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,440
you're going to

273
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:27,199
it's just that's part of nature bugs and

274
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,320
really just learning about them their

275
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,120
life cycle when to expect them

276
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,079
what they feed on how many times they

277
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,839
molt

278
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:39,199
you know what their metamorphosis stage

279
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,240
is is really just about learning what to

280
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,600
expect

281
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,600
what eats them

282
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,680
what they're attracted to

283
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,040
what predator insects how you can

284
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,000
attract them

285
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,480
and really encouraging as many species

286
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,720
as possible because biodiversity is

287
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,920
really the key and so that you don't

288
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,519
have an outburst of one species um and

289
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,879
you can really just keep a harmonious

290
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,320
balance

291
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,399
this is done

292
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,240
essentially through a lot of companion

293
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,519
planting

294
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,759
i do buckwheat nasturtium

295
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,240
lemon balm

296
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,360
daikon radish

297
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,839
and then

298
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,919
a ton of other like pollinator habitat

299
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,200
just mixed wildflower seeds all around

300
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,599
the property

301
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,759
but those first few species i talked

302
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,680
about i actually use

303
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,958
within my greenhouse

304
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,599
and so those

305
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:33,599
border the edges of the greenhouse beds

306
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,079
where my outdoor plants are

307
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:41,600
and those are all attractors for

308
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:44,000
predatory wasps hoverflies

309
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,320
ladybugs and so

310
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,679
a lot of those species that's actually

311
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,720
their larva

312
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:54,000
that are responsible for eating a lot of

313
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,000
the past like aphids

314
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:59,359
caterpillars stuff like that so really

315
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:03,600
just encouraging a good thriving healthy

316
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,000
ecosystem um is my first step of ipm

317
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,600
then being out there

318
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,958
looking

319
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,720
just seeing what's going on observing

320
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:15,919
and then definitely

321
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,879
defoiling removing leaves just pull them

322
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:21,838
off just get as many leaves as you can i

323
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:23,600
try to do a heavy defoil midway through

324
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,079
each grow cycle

325
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,720
and then again um right before

326
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:31,039
harvesting and now how about sprays do

327
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,639
you do any type of like sprays at all

328
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,838
weekly i know a lot of people do weekly

329
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,399
sprays of yeah depending on the pressure

330
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,760
and the time of the year i will do

331
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,320
sprays

332
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,078
i have a whole outline on my patreon of

333
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,160
different sprays that you can use for

334
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:47,519
aphids specifically because that is a

335
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,199
big

336
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,078
pressure in northern california is the

337
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,600
aphid for aphids for instance they

338
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,359
really just need to be sprayed with

339
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,240
something they're soft bodied insects

340
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,480
and so if you spray them with just water

341
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,959
that's fine

342
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,360
and i like to use any opportunity i

343
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:07,599
spray my plants i use it as

344
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,399
an opportunity to feed them at the same

345
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,399
time so silica is in there because

346
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,839
silica penetrates the cell wall and

347
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:18,320
that's a very good defense against pests

348
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,920
pathogens fungal

349
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,160
anything that's going to attack the

350
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,399
plant if you have a stronger cell while

351
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:27,360
your plant is stronger to resist that so

352
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,360
any spray i do i start with silica

353
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,440
um and then there's a variety of

354
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,480
different things depending on what i'm

355
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:38,000
combating or what time of the year it is

356
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,159
i like to use zombie spores you know the

357
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,440
fungal spores that will

358
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:46,799
infect the pest and kill them that way

359
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,959
um and so that those need to be used

360
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:52,078
during the more humid time of the year

361
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:54,159
so maybe like later in the end of summer

362
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,599
or early spring when there's more

363
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,519
humidity

364
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,720
during the middle of the summer when

365
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,480
it's really hot and dry those techniques

366
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,639
aren't going to work as well

367
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,639
so it's really just about you know

368
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,480
knowing your environment what you've got

369
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,120
going on and then making the smart

370
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,879
decision on what to spray i really

371
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,278
don't encourage

372
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,958
using any pesticides even if they are

373
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,679
organic

374
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:22,719
they accumulate in our water waves they

375
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:25,599
get eaten and bioaccumulate up the food

376
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,079
chain and they can affect birds they can

377
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,000
affect all different species around you

378
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,439
so that's kind of like a last case

379
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
scenario

380
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,240
and oftentimes they will wipe out a lot

381
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,240
of the beneficial insects that you're

382
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,879
using as your soldiers you know your

383
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,600
first defense and so you can have this

384
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:46,240
big population growth of let's say

385
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,240
you're spraying a pyrethrum or something

386
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,278
and you want to wipe out aphids well

387
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,720
they're going to go ahead and they're

388
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:52,720
going to wipe out all the aphids but

389
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,000
they may wipe out all the ladybug larvae

390
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,199
as well

391
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
and a ladybug will reproduce only so

392
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:02,799
many um you know eggs hatch in so much

393
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,759
time whereas an aphid can give birth to

394
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:09,198
four live births a day so you can see

395
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,278
this explosion afterward of your pest

396
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:13,120
and then your predators that got killed

397
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,679
off are having a harder time catching

398
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,360
back up so really try to stay away from

399
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:20,078
pesticide sprays even if they are

400
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,360
organic that's good information aphids

401
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,759
they're uh

402
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,480
they're a pain i had them on my outdoor

403
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,399
garden one year and uh oh well first of

404
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,959
all i got lazy with the ipm so i didn't

405
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,399
spray like i should have got all the way

406
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,078
up to harvest day i'm like oh i'm gonna

407
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,480
have to bok choy tonight go outside and

408
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,319
they're just loaded with the aphids

409
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,480
loaded the lettuce was fine right next

410
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,480
to it but the aphids they were just

411
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,720
buried in as deep as they could kind of

412
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,800
be within the leaves of the bok choy and

413
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,879
that was disappointing so

414
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,758
don't slack when it comes to ipm

415
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:54,399
especially outdoors because uh it's just

416
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,278
it's not a good feeling when the bugs

417
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,000
like are just all over your plants right

418
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,439
also remember you're 10

419
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,600
it's kind of like tithing you know

420
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,120
permaculture is that 10 rule that 10 of

421
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,879
your garden you should just expect to

422
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,159
give it back to mother earth give it

423
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:11,679
back to the pests

424
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,399
that's a good saying i don't think i've

425
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,559
even heard that before

426
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,000
now how about root aphids i know you've

427
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,919
encountered those before and those

428
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
aren't something i'm very familiar with

429
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,559
can you talk to us about root aphids and

430
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,039
what you did to combat them yeah um root

431
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,879
aphids are a pain in the butt because

432
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,039
they often um

433
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,759
go unnoticed for a long time because

434
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,439
they are in the roots and that's not

435
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,440
something that you're looking at

436
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,600
um and so

437
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,680
typically you start seeing what looks

438
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,759
like a magnesium deficiency in your

439
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:47,039
leaves that you know christmas tree

440
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:50,879
pattern the intervenal chlorosis

441
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:53,439
and you're like oh no am i deficient

442
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,519
this is so crazy why what's going on and

443
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,880
then you find little tiny things

444
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,078
crawling around

445
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,838
in your root zone and um

446
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,919
that's what happened for me i finally

447
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,360
took a plant out to look at it because i

448
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,558
knew there was no way i could be

449
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,000
deficient

450
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,279
and

451
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,599
i found them lo and behold and basically

452
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,678
i thought well i looked up what eats

453
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,438
root aphids

454
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,759
rove beetles

455
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,199
are amazing super fast if you watch them

456
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:23,038
they're like

457
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,959
running through your soil looking for

458
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:27,838
things hunting they're like vicious

459
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,919
little killers so getting row beetles um

460
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,399
in there either purchasing them i've

461
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,038
never actually purchased any predatory

462
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,038
insects i just plant um

463
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:40,240
plants to attract them

464
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:42,640
um and create that habitat but the rogue

465
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,038
beetles and then i act i did purchase

466
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,400
nematodes so i just got the triple

467
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:48,079
threat from

468
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,360
arbigo organics

469
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,240
and inoculated my beds and everything

470
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,279
with

471
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:59,279
the anemics i'm sorry the nematodes

472
00:17:55,279 --> 00:18:02,160
and then i did use anemics as well a

473
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,879
root drench and that was only in

474
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,160
the plants that were in pots with root

475
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,320
aphids i wouldn't recommend

476
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,840
doing a root drench in your living soil

477
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,960
beds

478
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,639
if you have

479
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,400
those beneficials like the rove beetles

480
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,799
and stuff like that in there

481
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,759
but if you are in a small container

482
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:25,279
using something like nemix um

483
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:28,000
which is uh from the azdractin you know

484
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,839
based pesticide it is organic but again

485
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,480
all of those things i talked about

486
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:35,759
apply to organic pesticides as well

487
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:39,200
but i had really good success with that

488
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,839
and then there's this thing called um

489
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,400
basania

490
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:46,399
bavaria i'm probably butchering that um

491
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,160
so that's a strain of fungus that you

492
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,519
can also use

493
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,759
and that will

494
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:56,798
combat root aphids so the commonly used

495
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:59,679
botana guard wp22 i believe and it's the

496
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,119
product that carries that strain gotcha

497
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,400
okay cool

498
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,879
let's flip it up let's stop talking

499
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,038
about bugs and let's talk about soil

500
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,960
building kind of gets into the diy type

501
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,798
of thing i know a lot of growers they

502
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,279
they go to their local hydroponic store

503
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:16,000
and they buy bag soil right potting soil

504
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,599
now you specialize in just using the

505
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,640
native soil right the soil in your

506
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,038
backyard

507
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,880
and kind of reviving that can you talk

508
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,558
to us about how somebody would kind of

509
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,440
go about doing that

510
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,720
yeah definitely um so

511
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,759
the thing with

512
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,400
potting soil in a bag it's really not

513
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,440
soil that's potting mix

514
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,720
it is

515
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,519
mostly organic matter and that organic

516
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,798
matter is going to be used up within

517
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:46,879
one cycle pretty much you you can

518
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:49,519
pretty much guarantee that by the end of

519
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,760
that growing season your plant is going

520
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,918
to have extracted everything out of that

521
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:57,279
bag of soil that it can

522
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,679
with native soil

523
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:02,720
it really has very low organic matter

524
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,360
and it's more mineral content and that

525
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,079
is what our nutrients are and so

526
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:10,399
implementing native soil is really a way

527
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,839
of just unlocking like a savings account

528
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,320
of nutrients

529
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:16,319
and in order for you to do that you just

530
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,158
have to build up the organic matter

531
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:18,879
because that's what you're lacking

532
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,440
so

533
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,320
poop of any form like

534
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,159
you know if you have access to um the

535
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,759
resource conservation district in your

536
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,679
county you can get a hold of them and

537
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,960
they will actually deliver free manure

538
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,919
to your house

539
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,400
um if you know anyone with a horse or a

540
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,480
cow you can literally i've knocked on my

541
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,320
neighbor's door and said hey can i bring

542
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,919
a wheelbarrow over and shovel some of

543
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,599
your poop out of your yard for you and i

544
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,799
like yeah go ahead

545
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,678
um

546
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:49,359
composting that is a huge way of

547
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,919
reducing your waste

548
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:54,319
40 of all landfills could be composted

549
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,640
at home imagine your carbon footprint

550
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,480
being reduced by just instead of

551
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,000
throwing your food away in the trash

552
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,839
where it's going to get buried in a

553
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,159
piece of plastic in a landfill turn into

554
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:06,558
methane contribute to greenhouse gas

555
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,080
emissions you fed your plant with it

556
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:11,678
you're saving money and you're saving

557
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:14,399
the planet it's like win-win right there

558
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,880
um so basically whatever form of organic

559
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,200
matter you can get get your hands on it

560
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,919
um cardboard i went to a waste

561
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,480
reclamation center and the number one

562
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,320
thing being thrown away is packaging

563
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,200
amazon think about you get a box within

564
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:31,200
a box within a box if you can break down

565
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,120
all of your cardboard you can use that

566
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,960
to build your soil literally that's

567
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:37,359
carbohydrates your plants

568
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,720
will that will create soil for you

569
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:44,879
um so you've got manure you've got

570
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,240
cardboard you've got kitchen waste

571
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,799
and then

572
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,798
you know your

573
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,360
compost another form you can use is

574
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,440
worms

575
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,759
worm composting is super easy no matter

576
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,240
where you live if you're in an apartment

577
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:02,720
you can have a worm bin

578
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,759
and the thing with worms is

579
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,558
whatever they eat comes out seven to

580
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,879
eleven times richer so if you feed your

581
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:13,279
worms you know something with a three

582
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,320
three three you know you're saying and

583
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:19,279
ratio of npk it's going to be a higher

584
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,399
ratio like 21 21 21

585
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,158
so

586
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,960
that doesn't happen often in nature

587
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,720
usually the energy taken you lose energy

588
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,480
as you go through a

589
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,400
chemical reaction or something like that

590
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,000
but with worms in this case you're

591
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,960
actually going to get more out of them

592
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,759
than you put in and worms are resilient

593
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,159
i mean i left my worms for a year one

594
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:42,640
time i forgot that i had a whole tote of

595
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,480
worms and i went out there and they were

596
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,880
still alive a year later i didn't even

597
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,120
touch them

598
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,039
so if you're a hands-off gardener worms

599
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,359
are an amazing option for building up

600
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:55,679
your soil and just getting a hold of as

601
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:57,918
much organic matter as you can that's

602
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,440
really the key um

603
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,159
so taking you know what people would

604
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,919
consider is trash that becomes your

605
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,000
plants food

606
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,240
and there are definitely things that you

607
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,798
need to take into consideration

608
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,720
when assessing your location for

609
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:13,759
building the soil

610
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,079
and

611
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:18,319
i wrote an eight-page paper on this

612
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:21,439
recently so if you're interested in the

613
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:24,000
details of how to analyze your native

614
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,320
soil for things like ph

615
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,640
organic matter that is there already

616
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:30,720
their npk

617
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,960
the drainage because that's going to be

618
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,720
a huge issue with growing depending on

619
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,519
your

620
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,960
if your soil is silt

621
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,359
clay

622
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,278
or sand it's going to affect

623
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,879
how they hold on how it holds onto

624
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:46,720
nutrients

625
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,799
how the water drains through it and

626
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,278
there are many ways you can determine

627
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:53,278
this at home you don't need a fancy soil

628
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,359
test kit you don't need to send it to a

629
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:58,159
lab you can just do things through

630
00:23:55,359 --> 00:24:00,719
observation feel

631
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,720
and a few other little tests

632
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,960
to just determine what kind of soil you

633
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,360
have and then how you can build it up

634
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,519
i'm just thinking about my soil back in

635
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,439
when i used to live in massachusetts and

636
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:14,240
i just think about the house i grew up

637
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,480
in paris backyard digging down there is

638
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,599
sand and it seems like there's a lot of

639
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,558
clay too so i always thought like

640
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:24,879
that that can't be used at all with with

641
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:27,038
medicinal plants because of

642
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,600
you know i think it's well known even

643
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:31,038
amongst intermediate beginners that

644
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,759
there needs to be aeration down in the

645
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:37,038
root zone and having a real compact

646
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:38,960
medium plants don't thrive as well now

647
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:42,480
are you saying that i could potentially

648
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,319
revive that oh yeah sand and clay and

649
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,759
turn it into something that

650
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:51,119
okay clay is actually like one of the

651
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:53,200
best soil types you can have because it

652
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:56,079
is the smallest particle size it has the

653
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,440
highest cation exchange capacity the

654
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:59,278
those

655
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,679
particles that are so tiny yes they

656
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:04,079
contribute to compaction and lack of

657
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:07,679
aeration lack of drainage

658
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:09,199
but they are more readily available

659
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,559
accessible nutrients because the

660
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:15,600
particle sizes are so small so

661
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:17,759
really what you need to do is grow some

662
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:20,639
carrots potatoes

663
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:23,119
daikon radish grow as much as you can

664
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,880
and let it die don't harvest it you just

665
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,439
throw seeds out there they're really

666
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,360
cheap and as it grows and it breaks up

667
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,919
then you're building your organic matter

668
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:36,158
you're breaking up your compaction of

669
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:39,038
that clay that hard dense pack and

670
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,120
in a season you can change it around wow

671
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,798
that's really good info yeah

672
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:43,678
now let me ask you this

673
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:45,359
there are going to be some people that

674
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,798
are watching this that don't want to

675
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:48,319
wait that season

676
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,720
do you recommend

677
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:52,798
people using um you know their native

678
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,319
soil in the backyard and amending it

679
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,960
with some of these blends that are out

680
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,798
there made dr earth blend or build a

681
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,720
soil blend or anything like that do you

682
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:04,798
recommend going that road or or not

683
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:07,839
really um no i don't really i think that

684
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:11,200
um if you want so

685
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:14,000
clay specifically is one of those soils

686
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,000
that will take you know your time

687
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,759
doing it the way that i suggested but if

688
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,798
you don't want to wait

689
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:22,960
then you can use a tiller i know that i

690
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:24,720
there's this whole thing of no till till

691
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,200
but in this scenario

692
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,600
if you have a lot of compaction and you

693
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,679
want to grow immediately

694
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:34,798
i would recommend getting a small

695
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,679
renting a small tiller and breaking or a

696
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:37,839
hand

697
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,278
pickaxe that's what i've used if you

698
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:40,959
have the muscles and you're willing to

699
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:43,679
put in the work

700
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,120
and you break that up and then buy a

701
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,919
yard of

702
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,839
bulk compost from someone you can buy a

703
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,200
bag of this soil mix that you're talking

704
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:55,519
about but truly i mean

705
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,000
it's probably expensive it's in you have

706
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:01,519
to ship it to you and most people have

707
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,480
local soil yards where um you can buy a

708
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:07,440
truckload of soil of compost made there

709
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,798
in your hometown for like forty dollars

710
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:14,240
um for an entire yard and that i don't

711
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:17,759
know how much those bags are that you um

712
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:20,399
suggested but usually a bag of soil is

713
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,960
like what three cubic feet

714
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:25,519
and they're like ten to fifteen dollars

715
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,679
sometimes twenty dollars for a bag so

716
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:30,158
how many bags i'm just thinking if

717
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,640
you're going for efficiency you wanna

718
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,278
grow something right away really just

719
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,679
getting some good quality compost from a

720
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:40,319
local source

721
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:43,200
is probably your best bet because those

722
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:46,720
bags often have a lot of

723
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,200
vermiculite pumice lava rock stuff like

724
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,000
that that doesn't mix really well with

725
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,720
clay that comes to the top as you water

726
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,159
it um so if you're going to use native

727
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,960
soil i recommend just getting

728
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:03,760
compost from a local source and using a

729
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:07,120
tiller so that you can till in the

730
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:10,319
compost with your native soil or the

731
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:12,239
pickaxe or whatever one of those um

732
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:15,359
handhelds you know when i'm talking

733
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,519
about the three teeth um prong things

734
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,119
that you step on and work in with i i

735
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:22,079
don't know the name of it but

736
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:25,199
that thing um

737
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,798
yeah i mean so the thing is that the the

738
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,679
drainage is going to be completely

739
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:33,038
different in a bag of potting mix to to

740
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,720
clay and so if you just buy a bunch of

741
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,720
potting mix and you put it on top of

742
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,278
your native soil you're going to get a

743
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,600
hard pan layer because well sorry sorry

744
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,839
let me uh i was referring to the not

745
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,199
non-actual potting soil from bags but

746
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,359
more like the

747
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,640
the nutrient blends like down to earth

748
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,918
makes a lot of those uh amendments like

749
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,520
having those amendments but they're

750
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,559
actually a blend of amendments that's

751
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,038
what i meant

752
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:58,558
more of that instead of the potting soil

753
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,480
yeah i didn't know i didn't know what

754
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:03,119
you were referencing i apologize yes i

755
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,319
use down to earth um and mix that in

756
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:09,199
definitely um knowing what's in your

757
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:10,798
soil a little bit like um if you know

758
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,360
that you're devoid of nutrients and you

759
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:15,839
need to add things mend your native soil

760
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:16,719
definitely i amend my native soil with

761
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,079
um

762
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,679
like a sea blend of like crab shrimp

763
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:22,558
oyster

764
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,519
with

765
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,079
a

766
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,829
different mycorrhizal inoculants

767
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:28,319
bacteria

768
00:29:26,829 --> 00:29:30,639
[Music]

769
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:33,519
rice holes are amazing for aeration

770
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,520
instead of pumice or vermiculite because

771
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,558
rice holes

772
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,480
hold water they break down and they are

773
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:42,720
90 silica

774
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,679
so there you go you're adding more of

775
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,640
that to your plants um nutrients

776
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,038
um

777
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,679
but yeah yeah definitely amend it i'm

778
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:55,038
not saying don't amend um because

779
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,798
especially in a medicinal crop that eats

780
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:59,119
a lot and if you're trying to get

781
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,960
multiple cycles out

782
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:03,918
in a growing season

783
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,558
you're you're going to want to replenish

784
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,399
and especially if it's brand new native

785
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:09,599
soil that you're just building up

786
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:11,759
because

787
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,398
in order to en to access all of the

788
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:16,798
nutrients you have to have microbes

789
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:20,398
there and create that habitat

790
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:22,158
and get that living soil web going and

791
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:23,519
so your if you know you're talking about

792
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,399
people who want to start growing right

793
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:26,079
away

794
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,000
um you're not it's not going to be

795
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:29,918
unlocked right away that's the thing

796
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,640
minerals need to be

797
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,440
cycled they need to become soluble and

798
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,679
so

799
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,440
with native soil you have an unlimited

800
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,399
supply of them but you need to figure

801
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,399
out how to unlock them and so using

802
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:44,959
nutrients up front you know you're down

803
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:47,359
to earth blends or your um

804
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,919
build a soil or whatever it is that your

805
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:51,918
favorite is i have a local um farm

806
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,159
supply store that makes their own

807
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,640
fertilizer i try and always support

808
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,480
local as much as possible so definitely

809
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,919
you know do that

810
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,679
um

811
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,600
and yeah but

812
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:07,519
you're gonna be able to

813
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:10,079
spend a lot less money on amendments

814
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:13,120
using your native soil versus

815
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:16,480
mixing in potting soil you know

816
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:17,759
great point for sure absolutely now soil

817
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,679
testing

818
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,359
i know you you said earlier you don't

819
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,038
really have to do the soil testing side

820
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,959
of things some viewers they're going to

821
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,158
want to do the soil testing

822
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,840
when they're building up their native

823
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,840
soil can you talk to us a little bit

824
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,599
about like the testing side of things

825
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:35,119
you know macronutrient content or

826
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:37,678
whatever yeah definitely um like i said

827
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:40,319
i literally just published an eight-page

828
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,720
paper on testing doing your own home

829
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,720
testing and so it goes through

830
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,798
everything that you can do at home to do

831
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,000
these tests it even links products where

832
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:49,038
you can buy

833
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,119
um

834
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:56,480
like a at home npk test and ph test

835
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:58,558
and it describes how to do these with a

836
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,399
thing called a slurry test and so

837
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:01,278
basically you're going to

838
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,918
um

839
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:06,558
take a glass jar you know like a mason

840
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,559
jar with a lid and uh dig down about

841
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:10,879
eight inches in your native soil

842
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:12,879
and make sure your hands are clean your

843
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,000
tools are clean that there's no

844
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,200
um way that any fertilizer could be on

845
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,119
those

846
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,640
tools because that will skew your test

847
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:22,079
for sure

848
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,759
and

849
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:26,398
take a little bit of that soil and fill

850
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,398
your jar up about a third of the way

851
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:31,359
and then fill the rest of the jar with

852
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:34,079
distilled or dechlorinated water um

853
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:35,038
and go ahead and give that a big old

854
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:37,678
shape

855
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:39,679
and let it sit for a while

856
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,440
um until it settles

857
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:46,399
and so you can go ahead and buy an

858
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,200
at-home npk test or if you have your ph

859
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:49,199
pen

860
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,600
and you can use the

861
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,558
solution in that jar and use a little

862
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:57,599
test strip and you can find out

863
00:32:54,558 --> 00:33:00,639
general area of your macronutrients as

864
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:03,038
well as your ph of your soil through

865
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,240
this little at-home test and i mean like

866
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:07,038
30 minutes

867
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,480
you'll be able to find out at least um

868
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:12,240
if your soil can sustain some life

869
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,200
and where what direction you need to

870
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,519
build

871
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,840
in what you need to amend it with

872
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,759
other than that um

873
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,278
it's really a generalization i don't

874
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:22,079
know if you've used those tests the

875
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:24,480
little

876
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:26,879
like strips you put it in the water

877
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,720
um and it'll tell you i use them for my

878
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,200
pool that's about it

879
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,519
there you go um it's good it's basically

880
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:37,360
the same idea and it'll give you like a

881
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,720
color scale of how you know low

882
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:41,439
moderate

883
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,600
excessive of nitrogen potassium

884
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,480
phosphorous um

885
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:48,398
but your micronutrients really your

886
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,159
micronutrients you should have a decent

887
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:52,319
amount of micronutrients in all native

888
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,760
soil because micronutrients

889
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:57,200
come from rocks you know you think

890
00:33:53,759 --> 00:34:00,398
calcium magnesium manganese boron copper

891
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,159
that's all like from rocks so

892
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:04,079
it should be there

893
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,240
other places are going to have more

894
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:09,519
available than others like if you live

895
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,320
near in glacial territory you think

896
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:14,639
about people order glacial rock dust if

897
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,919
you live in a glacial valley you

898
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,919
probably have freaking awesome

899
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,319
micronutrients in your soil

900
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,719
um if you live by a volcano you have

901
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,519
that people get volcanic ash they order

902
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,959
it to you know basalt that so if you

903
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,759
just know a little bit about where you

904
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,679
live um you could have like a gold mine

905
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,119
of nutrients right under your feet and

906
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,720
you didn't even know it just doing a

907
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,200
little bit of research and putting that

908
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:40,158
effort in to getting to know your soil

909
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,239
goes a long way and will save you a ton

910
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,838
of money that's awesome yeah really good

911
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,199
information there appreciate you sharing

912
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:46,639
that one yeah

913
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,279
let's flip it up let's talk about

914
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,480
composting so we kind of touched on a

915
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,159
little bit earlier but i want to get

916
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,639
deeper into it

917
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,320
i don't compost i'm uh so i guess we

918
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,039
want to kind of speak more on beginners

919
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,280
terms right what you said earlier

920
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:03,759
kind of intrigued me the 40 would you

921
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,400
say 40 percent of waste could be

922
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,000
composted which is pretty crazy

923
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,800
could be composted

924
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,440
and all it takes this is the why i'm

925
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,359
doing what i'm doing talking to people i

926
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,320
could just sit at home and grow my

927
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:20,239
medicinal herbs and make my money and go

928
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,079
my own way but i want to get it out

929
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:23,598
there it's our responsibility to take

930
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,920
care of this planet and our

931
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,079
responsibility to take care of our waste

932
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,358
it's not the governments you know look

933
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,599
what they're doing i'm not going to go

934
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:33,279
on a rampage here but

935
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,160
we are the ones who make the biggest

936
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,200
change and so composting is one thing

937
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:40,960
everyone can do at home

938
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:42,719
and there's so many different varieties

939
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,559
and so basically

940
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:45,919
you need to ask yourself how much time

941
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,239
do you have

942
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,760
what resources do you have available to

943
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,879
you and those could be like your space

944
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,000
um

945
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,358
how much room you have uh how much waste

946
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,159
you produce

947
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,920
um if you you know just figure out how

948
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,920
much you want to invest into your

949
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,880
composting system and then that will

950
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,400
gauge what level of composting you want

951
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,079
to get into

952
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,800
you can be as simple like i said on the

953
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,760
simplest scale would be

954
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,359
worms that's literally the easiest way

955
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,640
you don't have to do anything you just

956
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,039
get a

957
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:23,199
little tote from home depot

958
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,039
take a quarter inch drill bit

959
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:28,159
drill some holes in the bottom for

960
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,960
drainage drill some holes at the top for

961
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:30,480
air

962
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,280
put the lid on

963
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,760
shred some paper throw it in there get a

964
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,040
pound of red wigglers

965
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,880
and those are the ones you want for

966
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:40,960
composting because they live in the top

967
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,358
soil and they um

968
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,960
the top six inches and they're

969
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:47,119
really really good they eat their weight

970
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,639
like every day in

971
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:52,160
food so if you for every square foot of

972
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:55,598
worms you have

973
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:57,920
you want one pound of food so just take

974
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,920
that into consideration of how much

975
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,599
kitchen scraps you've got going on and

976
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,519
how many worms you need

977
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,440
but you can put them you could do it in

978
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:07,199
the tote in the rectangular tote or you

979
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,440
can do it in a five gallon bucket you

980
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:10,559
can leave it in your garage it doesn't

981
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,599
smell

982
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:15,358
just make sure that it is somewhere

983
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,039
that if it leaks out the bottom that

984
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,799
you're okay with it maybe you put a

985
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:20,639
saucer underneath

986
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,000
just beware of that but that is

987
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,519
literally like the easiest way to

988
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,960
compost

989
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:27,759
if you want to

990
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,079
um take it up a notch and start you have

991
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,760
a lot more that you have available to

992
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,720
compost if you've got a big yard with

993
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,560
lots of yard clippings um

994
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,598
or a garden where you're constantly

995
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:40,719
weeding

996
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,960
um or if you're growing medicinal herbs

997
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:45,759
and you're de-leafing a lot

998
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,440
and you have those materials accessible

999
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,440
then maybe you want to get a little bit

1000
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,599
bigger and you want an actual compost

1001
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,880
pile in your yard

1002
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,559
um depending on what kind of

1003
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,440
pests you have around if you've got like

1004
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,719
raccoons or bears

1005
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,920
i live in the country so these are

1006
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:04,559
things i have to worry about with

1007
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,000
compost but if you're in a neighborhood

1008
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:07,838
where you don't have to worry about that

1009
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,119
then you can have it a little bit more

1010
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:11,440
open

1011
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,200
so either you need to have it enclosed

1012
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,720
if you have pests or you can have it

1013
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:17,118
open if you're not worried about that

1014
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:20,239
you can just have a pile

1015
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,200
and the rule of thumb for composting

1016
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,399
is

1017
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:25,759
uh 30 parts of nitrogen to one part

1018
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,960
carbon

1019
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,640
so

1020
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:33,280
nitrogen materials would be your green

1021
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:36,000
your kitchen scraps your grass clippings

1022
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,839
your leaves things of that nature

1023
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,400
your carbon

1024
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:43,440
is your dried grass

1025
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,400
your dead leaves

1026
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,599
wood chips all of the cardboard that you

1027
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,880
have from amazon that's all carbon

1028
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,640
and so

1029
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,358
you don't have it doesn't have to be

1030
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:59,358
exactly 30 to 1 this is just a nice

1031
00:38:55,358 --> 00:39:01,679
ratio of the optimal ratio

1032
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:04,960
and the way you can determine this is

1033
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:08,319
just having equal volume so if you have

1034
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,519
a five gallon bucket of kitchen scrap

1035
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,440
then a five gallon bucket of dry leaves

1036
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:16,719
or dry grass

1037
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,159
and that would be about 30 to 1 ratio so

1038
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:19,358
combine those

1039
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:21,279
mix them up

1040
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:22,880
and all you need

1041
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,240
is a little air

1042
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,039
a little water

1043
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,959
and a little time and you've got compost

1044
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:31,759
you make it sound a lot easier than i

1045
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,358
thought yeah no it is and you it depends

1046
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,960
on how much time like i said how much

1047
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:36,799
time you want to put into it some people

1048
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,639
are like okay

1049
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,720
i'm gonna go out there and i'm gonna

1050
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,559
turn my compost pile every day and i'm

1051
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:45,598
gonna water it and in four weeks i have

1052
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:47,519
black gold or like me i have so many

1053
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,000
things going on i have a three

1054
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:53,358
compartment system and so basically i

1055
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,800
have um you know one compartment is i'm

1056
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:56,880
adding to it all the time i'm just

1057
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,000
throwing my kitchen scraps and what i

1058
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,079
like to do

1059
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,639
is when i go to the grocery store

1060
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,960
i get a paper bag

1061
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:07,279
and i use the paper bag for throwing all

1062
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,838
my kitchen scraps in and then your paper

1063
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,440
bag is your carbon right there you just

1064
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:12,960
take that paper bag and you throw it

1065
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,599
into your compartment you're like okay

1066
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,199
bye done and you just keep adding keep

1067
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,119
adding keep adding

1068
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:21,118
and then

1069
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,318
when you you finally you filled your

1070
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,960
compartment which ideally three feet

1071
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:30,880
high by three feet wide is the ideal

1072
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,760
volume for um getting the compost going

1073
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,559
um

1074
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,599
so i get it up to that point and then i

1075
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:40,639
start watering it and i don't add to it

1076
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:43,680
if i have old compost i will cover the

1077
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:45,759
top of it with old compost or i have

1078
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,399
goats and chickens so i can cover it

1079
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,599
with the manure and really just covering

1080
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,358
that

1081
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,720
kind of locks in

1082
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:55,039
the moisture

1083
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:57,519
and gets things kick-started and adds

1084
00:40:55,039 --> 00:41:00,239
the heat and gets the bacteria going and

1085
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:01,679
moving brings in the microbes from the

1086
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:03,919
old composter

1087
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:04,960
or manure and really gets things moving

1088
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,960
fast

1089
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,079
and just making sure you water it is

1090
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,639
really

1091
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,800
you know once a month

1092
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:14,559
and if it rains where you're at you know

1093
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,720
then you don't even have to water it

1094
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,318
just maybe go put a stick in there and

1095
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:20,879
move it around and make sure it doesn't

1096
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:22,880
stink if it starts stinking then you're

1097
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,960
going you've gone anaerobic and you need

1098
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,160
more oxygen um

1099
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,039
but

1100
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:29,199
really

1101
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:32,159
just if you have a pitchfork or a shovel

1102
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:35,439
go and turn it once a month and within

1103
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:36,318
four months you'll have compost it's not

1104
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,760
hard

1105
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:39,880
everyone can do it

1106
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,319
i was going to buy one of those

1107
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,440
vermicompost bins with the multiple

1108
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:44,880
layers

1109
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,559
and i think they're actually like 100

1110
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,280
bucks on amazon but now you mentioned i

1111
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:51,358
can just get a bin locally i'll just buy

1112
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,760
a bin and do it that way so when i'm

1113
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:54,960
adding stuff in to it you can fill it

1114
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,560
all the way up and then just let the

1115
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,800
worms go nuts for

1116
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:00,880
four months keep it moist one thing i

1117
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,519
was worried about is

1118
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,760
temperature at winter time in my garage

1119
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:08,079
it gets cold it gets

1120
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,640
you know 40 degrees or so is it gonna be

1121
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,119
like a slow of activity is there like a

1122
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:15,118
too cold of temperature to where it'll

1123
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,760
just slow down in the winter it'll slow

1124
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,559
down but it's not going to stop they're

1125
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,599
you know

1126
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:23,519
the red wigglers have a huge range of

1127
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,359
temperature they'll survive down to like

1128
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:29,119
20 degrees and up to 90 degrees um and

1129
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:31,519
then they just stop reproducing once

1130
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,240
they get out of that boundary they stop

1131
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:36,318
reproducing but they're still alive and

1132
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:39,039
the more you put in there the more

1133
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:41,519
insulation it will have and protect them

1134
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:43,119
and keep things warm and kind of on the

1135
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:45,599
upward side of temperature i know it

1136
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:47,920
can't get too hot and you've got to turn

1137
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,318
the piles every now and then what's the

1138
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,240
kind of general rule for turning your

1139
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:54,559
compost piles

1140
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,639
like i said it depends on how fast you

1141
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:59,358
want the compost how much time you have

1142
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:01,358
if you want compost quickly turn your

1143
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:04,078
pile once a week and within four to six

1144
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:06,480
weeks you'll have compost if you don't

1145
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,800
have time to do that

1146
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,480
if you do it once it's still no matter

1147
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,560
what it's going to break down it just

1148
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,199
depends on how fast you want it to how

1149
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:17,039
much space you have um i have a pile

1150
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:18,879
that i've only turned

1151
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:20,880
twice this year

1152
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,960
but it's shrinking and shrinking and

1153
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,599
shrinking it started out like five feet

1154
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,358
tall and now it's two feet tall and it

1155
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,280
doesn't smell nothing gets into it and

1156
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:32,000
it's just slowly breaking down so it's

1157
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,000
really up to you and how quickly you

1158
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,719
want the compost accessible if you're

1159
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,119
composting for nutrients and fertilizer

1160
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:40,639
or your composting to

1161
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,039
reduce your carbon footprint and your

1162
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:45,039
waste you know there's a difference so i

1163
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:47,519
hope you're doing compost now i really

1164
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:49,920
hope that i have convinced you that you

1165
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,599
will help save the world by composting

1166
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,720
so next time we talk you better have

1167
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:57,039
some worms or something at least okay

1168
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:58,639
all right i will i'm more confident now

1169
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:00,400
because you break it down in more of a

1170
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:01,598
beginner-friendly manner i mean it seems

1171
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,800
like

1172
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,119
there's so many people out there that

1173
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,200
just it makes it so complex but you have

1174
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,440
this talent to where you're able to

1175
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:11,358
explain a little bit more easier

1176
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,200
to where a guy like me can grasp it

1177
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:15,440
pretty easy you know what i mean is more

1178
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:16,318
confident to start having the knowledge

1179
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,880
so

1180
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:21,759
um yeah i taught little kids how to worm

1181
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:25,280
compost at the fair so

1182
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,280
they learn you can learn

1183
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,920
and then do you have any other kind of

1184
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,599
tips for people that are new to

1185
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:36,800
composting um you know just keep on keep

1186
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:39,440
on adding things like just be don't

1187
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,119
don't limit yourself to what you read

1188
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,200
like how you said you weren't doing it

1189
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,519
because of a limiting belief that you

1190
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:47,919
thought it was all this complexity it's

1191
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:52,000
really it's a pile think of the forest

1192
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:54,159
we go and buy alaskan humus

1193
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,960
and what is that that is compost that

1194
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:57,838
took

1195
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,599
uh thousands of years to break down all

1196
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:02,799
of the things in the forest floor the

1197
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:05,519
poop the leaves the bark the fish guts

1198
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,079
from the bears and it just slowly did

1199
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:10,159
its thing so composting is literally

1200
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,960
it could be it could take years or it

1201
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:17,118
can take weeks so just play with it and

1202
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,400
they say not to add like bones and meat

1203
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,880
and fat

1204
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:25,200
i do i don't care i throw it in there

1205
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:28,079
and um i have five dogs so they protect

1206
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:30,239
it from like you know

1207
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,240
raccoons and stuff like that so if you

1208
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,399
have like i said if you got those things

1209
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:36,879
don't maybe don't throw in the tasty

1210
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,358
treats um but

1211
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,920
don't be afraid just go ahead and try it

1212
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:44,960
and see what happens some people compost

1213
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:47,599
poop like their own humanure i am not a

1214
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,960
component of that

1215
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,119
now people are going to go take dumps in

1216
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,318
their compost pile

1217
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,358
so there's one more thing i want to talk

1218
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:54,719
about which i thought was super

1219
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:56,719
interesting

1220
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:59,358
uh before we end this podcast which is

1221
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:01,358
gardening by the moon

1222
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:02,880
so you plant according to different moon

1223
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:05,119
phases huh can you talk to us a little

1224
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,680
bit about that yeah um honestly it's

1225
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:11,200
just interesting to me um

1226
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:13,679
there i believe it's rudolph steiner um

1227
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,919
there's a french guy who came up with

1228
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:18,078
the whole biodynamic movement at the

1229
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,720
same time as the organic movement in the

1230
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,880
like 60s happened and

1231
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,598
the idea is that

1232
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,400
you know the moon cycle has different

1233
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,559
poles and gravity and that affects water

1234
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,680
it affects the tides

1235
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:34,000
and so

1236
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,559
when you have you know a new moon is

1237
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,039
supposedly a really good time to plant a

1238
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:40,880
seed because the gravitational pull of

1239
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:43,358
water is

1240
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,680
bringing water to the surface and so if

1241
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:48,639
you're you've sewn your seeds outside

1242
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:52,639
during the new moon it should stay moist

1243
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:55,039
longer because of the gravity um and so

1244
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:58,719
i don't know if it's

1245
00:46:55,039 --> 00:47:02,400
100 real or if it's a little woo-woo but

1246
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:05,439
you know i figure our ancestors for the

1247
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,440
last 15 000 years the advent of

1248
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,440
agriculture have been

1249
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,519
keeping track of time with the moon and

1250
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:16,639
so why not go ahead and give thanks and

1251
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:18,880
work with mother earth and use what the

1252
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:19,759
tools that she has provided as easy as

1253
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,800
just

1254
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,839
the sky

1255
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:26,160
and why not do it and it's fun and i

1256
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:27,920
like reading my horoscope so why not

1257
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:31,039
plant my seeds with the new moon and

1258
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,159
harvest on full moon so i don't know i

1259
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:35,039
don't know

1260
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:36,799
biodynamic i've really i've gone to a

1261
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:38,880
few workshops i actually went to a

1262
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,440
biodynamic composting workshop where

1263
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,480
these women literally

1264
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,358
butcher

1265
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,679
a cow on the full moon

1266
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:51,519
and they take the blood

1267
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:54,719
and drain the blood into a vase and

1268
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:58,000
ferment the blood and then take the ins

1269
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:59,759
the guts and stuff it with digestive

1270
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,440
medicinal herbs

1271
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,960
like chamomile

1272
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,119
and

1273
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,880
comfrey and all different kinds of

1274
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,358
medicinal herbs and they put it in there

1275
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:12,400
and then they bury the intestines with

1276
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:15,519
these uh digestive herbs and then they

1277
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:18,160
have the um the blood fermenting and

1278
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:21,679
then they go ahead and they compost all

1279
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:23,960
of this with the moon cycle and then

1280
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:26,558
they're selling their supercharged

1281
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:29,519
biodynamic compost for eight hundred

1282
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:31,839
dollars a yard like

1283
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:34,000
what i don't know that

1284
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:36,239
i don't know i don't know about that but

1285
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,760
it's out there people do it just when

1286
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,838
you think you've heard about all the

1287
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,760
gardening techniques there are you get

1288
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:43,119
slapped with something that's

1289
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,160
kind of absurd that you would never

1290
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:49,358
think was a thing you know

1291
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:51,279
well queen this was a fantastic talk i

learned so much uh you know about

1293
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:58,400
building soil some cool diy hacks ipm

1294
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:01,040
composting which i promise i'll do

1295
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,720
before we meet next time for sure
