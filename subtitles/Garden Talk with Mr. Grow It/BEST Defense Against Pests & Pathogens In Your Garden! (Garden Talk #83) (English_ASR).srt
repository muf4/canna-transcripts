1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:05,459
coming up on Garden talk in the

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,679
hierarchy of needs of IPM the big chunk

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:09,960
of that is the first layer is that

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,058
defensive layer those passive approaches

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,280
and after a certain point you know it

6
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:16,618
gets diluted just from just humidity in

7
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:19,379
the air and it ends up just being a

8
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:20,939
basin of a virus rather than a

9
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:24,118
sterilizing basin

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:27,899
or just general stunting it reduces

11
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:29,339
yields by up to 55 in some cases and

12
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:30,719
it's really devastating some of these

13
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:33,780
industries where it's hopped over to

14
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,939
there's just a few days of dry soil you

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,500
can damage them and then do that over

16
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:39,539
the next week if there's a handful of

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,519
days where the soil is really dry you'll

18
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,979
really damage that population

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,020
it's really important to start off with

20
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,119
a holistic approach to gardening in

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,480
general and Pest Management in

22
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,479
particular

23
00:00:54,378 --> 00:00:59,399
what's up everybody if you that don't

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,079

founder and CEO of interlite he has a

29
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,379
significant amount of knowledge when it

30
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:15,000
comes to Pest Management viruses and

31
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:17,280
viroids and that's what we're going to

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,540
get into in today's episode thanks to

acknowledge that one of my goals for

38
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:34,019
this podcast is to bring zero cost for

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,118
information about gardening all plants

40
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:37,978
to the general public that being said

41
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:39,659
I'd like to thank the sponsors of

42
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:42,299
today's episode who helped make that

43
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,700
goal possible thanks to vivosun for

44
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,920
sponsoring this episode vivosun recently

45
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,840
released the smart grow system this

46
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,240
Marco system helps streamline the

47
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,340
growing process by automating a stage of

48
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,578
growth requirements on and off schedules

49
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,439
spec range airflow and circulation and

50
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:00,779
even records useful data about your

51
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,699
environment it is Wi-Fi capable and

52
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,320
connects to the vivosun app so you can

53
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,680
control your grow space from your

54
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,598
smartphone check out their website at

55
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,520

00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,919
YouTube description section below

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,560
AC Infinity is sponsoring this episode

58
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,619
they have two different series LED grow

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,560
lights the ion board and the ion grid

60
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:26,580
the ion board fixtures are board style

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,800
and use Samsung LM 301b diodes while the

62
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,160
ion Grid series has an open Center

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,959
design and uses Samsung

64
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:35,400
lm301h diodes I'll have a link in the

65
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,319
description section below so you can

66
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,719
learn more about these grow lights and

67
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,479
you can use discount code Mr Grow it if

and we are back welcome to the Garden

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,560
Talk podcast today I am joined with

75
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:01,439
Simon from interlite how you doing today

76
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,140
good how are you I'm doing great thanks

77
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,818
for asking so super pumped on what we

78
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:07,979
have to talk about today we're gonna be

79
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:10,738
talking about some pests and pathogens

80
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:13,018
so lots of good information you have a

81
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,180
ton of experience in regards to those

82
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:17,099
things but before we get deep into the

83
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,420
topics can you do an introduction tell

84
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:19,979
us a little bit about yourself and kind

85
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:22,559
of how you got into gardening

86
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:25,259
yeah sure so like you said I'm Simon

87
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,900
kepchar currently with insulite which is

88
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:30,239
a new next-gen crop protection uh

89
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,819
company that I'm the founder of

90
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,819
um but for years for most of my life

91
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:37,859
I've been very interested in agriculture

92
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:41,039
um starting out with uh permaculture

93
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,680
organic gardening food forests and

94
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:46,919
things like that but later in my life I

95
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,159
started to do IPM Consulting for just

96
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:52,679
general agriculture out here in Colorado

97
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,658
um which led me to eventually uh develop

98
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,459
the internal technology and see if we

99
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:58,739
can push crop protection into the future

100
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,360
a little bit sweet pretty

101
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,000
straightforward there

102
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,680
so let's get into IPM and I have a lot

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,539
of people that are beginners That Tune

104
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,400
and I podcast they might not know what

105
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:11,818
IPM is so let's start off with the

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,799
basics what is IPM and what IPM methods

107
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:16,079
do you use in your garden

108
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,840
yeah well I think IPM is perfect for

109
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,299
beginners because it's really important

110
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,519
to start off with a holistic approach to

111
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:25,859
gardening in general and Pest Management

112
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,079
in particular so IPM stands for

113
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,180
integrated Pest Management that means

114
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,418
rather than the sort of historic

115
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,579
approach where we plant a field we say

116
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:37,560
we know we're going to get pests we're

117
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,839
just going to wait until eventually we

118
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,879
see a massive infestation and then we'll

119
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,879
go head to head and fight it with some

120
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:47,519
powerful chemicals with IPM integrated

121
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,500
Pest Management we prepare and we look

122
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,758
at all of the methods that we have at

123
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,899
our disposal

124
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:57,780
and we use them uh in advance to an

125
00:04:54,899 --> 00:05:00,478
infestation we prepare we Scout we

126
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:02,879
identify and then we treat

127
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:06,000
um and it's sort of in IPM you build a

128
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:08,519
hierarchy of uh of requirements for

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,819
fighting fighting uh pests so you start

130
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:14,219
with General protective measures sort of

131
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:16,439
defensive strategies you start with

132
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,020
let's have standard operating procedures

133
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:22,139
to have really clean environments let's

134
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:24,180
have resistant crops you know let's uh

135
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,579
not necessarily if we can let's not do a

136
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,100
monoculture you know let's have multiple

137
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:31,319
crops in our fields or in our Gardens

138
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,320
then we look at sort of a higher level

139
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:37,199
approach let's keep our eyes out let's

140
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,538
learn how to identify crops or pests and

141
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,038
let's learn how to scout our garden and

142
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:43,259
make sure that we see any signs of

143
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:46,918
infestations early so that we can fight

144
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:48,840
them uh sort of passively and not have

145
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:50,459
to do this massive battle against an

146
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:54,599
existing infestation

147
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:56,219
so in terms of IPM approaches I really

148
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,020
recommend

149
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,080
what you first need to do is you need to

150
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:02,519
lay out and understand all possible

151
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:04,740
strategies that you have at your

152
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,799
disposal how they synergize with one

153
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,079
another and how they perhaps have uh

154
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,579
anti-synergies with one another so you

155
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,459
can really pick and choose what you need

156
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:17,519
to deploy so these include defensive

157
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:19,918
things like just building up like

158
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,560
physically physical barriers you know

159
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:24,560
protecting your crops if you're indoors

160
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,019
sealing a grow environment

161
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,740
to things like

162
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,799
traps

163
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,879
um you know foot baths sterilization

164
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,860
keeping things clean all the way to

165
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:40,319
active active

166
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,060
crop protection techniques like

167
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,439
obviously the spraying and application

168
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,259
of chemicals the introduction of

169
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:49,500
beneficial pests or beneficial insects

170
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:51,240
and um everything like that even to

171
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,339
higher technology like intralite light

172
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,079
treatments so what techniques do you use

173
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:57,659
in your garden

174
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,240
well I'm a little bit biased so I mainly

175
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,759
use the intralite technology that I've

176
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,978
been developing so I use that in

177
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,740
combination with just Dan what I

178
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:10,019
consider standard operating practices of

179
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,199
you know quarantining the environment

180
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:15,418
off you know cordoning it off from the

181
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,220
general environment you really need to

182
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:19,019
be in control of what comes in and out

183
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,180
of your in and out of your garden if you

184
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:23,698
can personally I have an indoor little

185
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,900
vertical Farm where I mainly Garden so

186
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:30,000
it's easy for me to to control it but I

187
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:33,179
would say if I was still doing an

188
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,500
outdoor Garden it would be I would do a

189
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,959
similar approach where I just try to

190
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,180
lock it down as much as I can through

191
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,299
physical barriers layers of Diatomaceous

192
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,459
Earth and just proactive passive

193
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,220
approaches so that you don't have to go

194
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:49,439
in and attack an infestation so you can

195
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,080
just prevent it from ever happening or

196
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,120
identify it early so those really

197
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,978
include

198
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,639
traps barriers

199
00:07:55,978 --> 00:08:01,379
um passive systems like beneficials

200
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,240
beneficial biologics and in my case the

201
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:05,219
insulated solution let's get into the

202
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,060
entry light a little bit because uh you

203
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,759
know people hearing that and they're

204
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,560
like what the heck is interrelated so

205
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,660
talk to us about what it is it's a light

206
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,699
right where it's basically shining on to

207
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,919
your plant or your medium and it's

208
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:20,580
actually is it killing off pests

209
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:22,258
entirely so entry light's a radical new

210
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:24,779
approach to crop protection technology

211
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,520
the best way that I think the most

212
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:29,399
intuitive way to understand it is to say

213
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,079
why is it that uh insects in particular

214
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,059
are always on the underside of your

215
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:35,458
leaves you know we're not when we look

216
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:37,139
for signs of infestation we may see

217
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,639
stippling on the top of a leaf and then

218
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:41,038
we flip it over and we see a bunch of

219
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,778
spider mites or aphids or thrips or

220
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,699
whatever why is it that they're living

221
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:46,379
on the underside of leaves the reason is

222
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,540
because they're protecting themselves

223
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:49,860
from harmful rays of the sun these are

224
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:51,899
the same rays of the Sun that would

225
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,139
cause us to have skin cancer after being

226
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:58,860
exposed to the Sun for many decades now

227
00:08:55,139 --> 00:09:00,659
intralite focuses those uh the specific

228
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,940
parts of the spectrum that are

229
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:05,879
pesticidal and we attenuate them and

230
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:09,240
modulate them and send them targeted at

231
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:11,639
the insects and at pathogens at a very

232
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,159
specific intensity and dosage this

233
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,778
allows us to damage the DNA of pests and

234
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,899
pathogens without harming the plants

235
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:20,159
themselves as DNA damage builds up and

236
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,259
will eventually collapse their

237
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,659
population or keep them below uh

238
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:27,059
economically impactful levels and

239
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:29,939
obviously I am biased I'll try not to um

240
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:31,439
just show for interlight too much but I

241
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,200
do believe that it's a it's a highly

242
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,899
effective crop protection technology and

243
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,259
it's sort of eliminates the need for

244
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,759
sort of ammunition of uh you know you

245
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:43,259
have to have these these chemicals

246
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,299
constantly being applied or you have to

247
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:47,819
have these beneficials constantly being

248
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,559
applied entrylight is just a one-time

249
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,680
purchase where you don't need to

250
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:55,199
continually Supply it which synergizes

251
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:57,899
with these IPM approaches

252
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,019
where in the hierarchy of needs of IPM

253
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:03,360
the big chunk of that is the first layer

254
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:06,240
is that defensive layer this passive

255
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,919
approaches which just prevent you from

256
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,320
having to use these extreme approaches

257
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,000
like direct chemical application okay

258
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,060
and then if you have like a full-blown

259
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,860
infestation how quickly will the

260
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:19,319
intralite kind of kill off that

261
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,899
population so it depends on the life

262
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,399
cycle of the the of the pests luckily

263
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,799
most of their life cycles are pretty

264
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,958
quick so because we're dealing in DNA

265
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:30,000
damage it's not likely that we'll kill

266
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,979
we won't kill an insect exposed to the

267
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,659
intralight pesticidal Spectrum what

268
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,120
we'll do is tear up their DNA and reduce

269
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:39,419
their ability to reproduce hatch or

270
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,679
mature so it sort of depends like if if

271
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:43,319
if we were dealing with something that

272
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,879
had a multi-year lifespan it would it

273
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,920
would take years for us to collapse as a

274
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,720
population but because we're dealing

275
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:51,599
with something that has a few day

276
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,459
lifespan or at least parts of its life

277
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,139
cycle that's measured in days or weeks

278
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:58,139
it's pretty easy for us to collapse

279
00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:00,620
populations within 7 to 14 days for

280
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:03,600
things like spider mites and aphids and

281
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,240
sternarinka in general and thrips okay

282
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,980
got it I'll definitely have a link to

283
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,240
interlite website down in the

284
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,100
description section below I know you

285
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,740
said uh and I didn't want to make this

286
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,320
whole video about like a sales pitch for

287
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,060
it and uh good thing because my audience

288
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,860
would sniff that out and call that out

289
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:23,458
they're pretty funny when it comes to

290
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,740
that so I'll do my best uh it is it's

291
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:27,659
just I have to sort of edit it out when

292
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,820
I think of what is your most effective

293
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:31,740
uh IPM Solutions I have to say okay

294
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,180
let's let's not talk about intro light

295
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,860
let's talk about the others and there

296
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:37,919
are many tried and true crop protection

297
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,899
Technologies outside of intralite that

298
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,519
I'm definitely a huge proponent of you

299
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:44,759
know I love me some diatomaceous earth

300
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,500
love neem oil that uh that spaghetti

301
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,600
squash smell of some neem freshly

302
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,458
sprayed neem oil and I'm I'm all for it

303
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,980
and later on in this episode we will get

304
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:55,679
into some of the pests that you could

305
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:58,620
face in your garden and how to tackle

306
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:01,559
um so first I do want to get into more

307
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:04,980
of like the viroids viruses pathogens

308
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:06,958
that are around and doing some damage to

309
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,959
people's crops but before we get into

310
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:13,139
that I know one of the main things that

311
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:16,018
kind of spread viruses and viroids is

312
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:17,699
not cleaning tools properly so I do want

313
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:19,440
to get into detail about the the proper

314
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,720
cleaning of tools then we'll get into

315
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,360
the viruses and viroids and so on and so

316
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,820
forth so what is the best way to

317
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,339
actually clean your tools or sanitize

318
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,540
your tools trimmers for example that's

319
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:33,000
one of the things that a lot of people

320
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:34,980
use and I've heard as simple as just

321
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,078
wiping it down with isopropyl alcohol

322
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,899
and you're good to go other people say

323
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:41,519
that that's not effective and that you

324
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:44,100
should actually be using hydrogen

325
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,799
peroxide in a soak for a certain period

326
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,139
of time talk to us about the best way to

327
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,199
clean and sanitize tools

328
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:54,120
so in terms of the actual ranking of

329
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,759
hydrogen peroxide alcohol solution

330
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,459
bleach bleach solution they're all

331
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:01,799
highly effective at killing viruses the

332
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:04,919
question is just what does you know you

333
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:06,958
have to imagine that tool is entirely

334
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:10,199
covered its surface is covered in really

335
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,939
virulent viruses that can in some cases

336
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:15,240
they can last on there for multiple

337
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,880
months so while wiping it down is very

338
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,959
effective the question is you know are

339
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:23,278
you wiping down 10 10 sets of trimming

340
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,319
scissors and are you sort of going

341
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,600
quickly on the last one and missing

342
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,300
those crevices so that's why an actual

343
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,180
soap can be more effective however one

344
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:36,059
the thing with soaks that I really find

345
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:38,939
people fall behind in is that it's easy

346
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:41,159
to you might have this like jar of

347
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,560
alcohol or this Basin of alcohol that

348
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:45,958
you soak your tools in and some people

349
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,759
will just leave the same thing of a

350
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:50,039
container of alcohol or whatever

351
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,539
sterilizing agent they have have they'll

352
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,519
just leave it there for multiple days

353
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,199
and they'll reuse it and reuse it and

354
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,600
after a certain point you know it gets

355
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,778
diluted just from humidity in the air

356
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,959
and it ends up just being a basin of the

357
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:06,299
virus rather than a sterilizing Basin so

358
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:09,179
I would say that a short soak is

359
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:10,919
probably the most effective solution in

360
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:12,659
whatever you're most comfortable with or

361
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:14,519
what's whatever is most readily

362
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:17,100
available to you bleach solution alcohol

363
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,980
solution or hydrogen peroxide solution I

364
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,320
would recommend a brief soak and then

365
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:25,379
removing them from that Basin cleaning

366
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,540
them and then regularly refreshing that

367
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:30,179
base and not necessarily every day but

368
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:32,219
at least every couple of days we see

369
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:34,859
this in large scale greenhouses and

370
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,139
large-scale Warehouse indoor grows where

371
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,980
they have a foot basin that everyone

372
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:42,539
steps in to uh to sterilize their shoes

373
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,278
and you know it's sort of an easy thing

374
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:46,198
to fall behind on you're doing a bunch

375
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:47,639
of things you're busy it's kind of the

376
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:49,559
last thing that you think of is oh I

377
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:53,519
need to refill that foot Basin and then

378
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:56,099
after a week it becomes the spreader of

379
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,360
of pathogens so it's just important to

380
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,459
be on top of that

381
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,019
and then how often should people be

382
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,578
cleaning their tools I mean some people

383
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:05,220
doing it after every cut some people

384
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:07,559
only doing it after each plant what's

385
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,440
your recommendation so unfortunately

386
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:12,899
it's really really regularly really

387
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,360
really consistently it's not each cut

388
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,458
but it's each plant because when we're

389
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,079
dealing with these viruses they're

390
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:22,138
transferring from one plant to another

391
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:24,000
through just physical you cut it there's

392
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:25,560
virus in that plant it's now on your

393
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,600
scissors and then when you cut the next

394
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,338
Plant you're infecting that plant so

395
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,339
it's not every cut when you're on one

396
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:35,160
plant but between two plants you should

397
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:38,519
clean your tools and it could be just a

398
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:40,439
quick but effective thorough wiping

399
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,060
um as well as you know even just

400
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,620
changing your gloves and being very

401
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:45,659
careful you know

402
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,419
a way to helpfully understand how

403
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:51,120
serious and how long-lasting these virus

404
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:54,659
particles can be consider tobacco mosaic

405
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,100
virus there are cases where all of these

406
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:58,139
standard operating procedures are in

407
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,019
place but a worker goes outside and

408
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:04,259
smokes a cigarette and on in that

409
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:06,839
cigarette living after you know years of

410
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:08,039
drying is a tobacco mosaic virus that

411
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:12,060
gets on their hands and then

412
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:14,698
contaminates the tobacco grows so it's

413
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:17,578
it's very virulent I would say be overly

414
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:19,679
overly cautious okay and then one last

415
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:21,958
question on cleaning tools I like to get

416
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,000
into the nitty-gritty of things so

417
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:25,559
you've got your trimmers you soak it in

418
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,120
hydrogen peroxide for example when you

419
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,039
take those trimmers out are you going

420
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,799
right in for the next cut or are you

421
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:35,039
like wiping it down with like a paper

422
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:36,838
towel or some sort of a towel I would

423
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,879
wipe it down with a towel but you have

424
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:40,560
to be careful to you know if you have

425
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,419
the same towel that you're using over

426
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,939
and over again you're going to just be

427
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:47,278
spreading continually spreading so I

428
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,259
would say if if it was just me

429
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:52,198
personally I'm taking a handful of cuts

430
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:53,820
it's a relatively small number it's you

431
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:56,819
know five to ten plants I would say why

432
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,920
don't you just have two or three sets of

433
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:02,100
scissors okay you use the first one you

434
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:04,078
take some Cuts soak it for the 10 or 15

435
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,519
minutes while you're taking a next set

436
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,438
of cuts with a fresh pair of scissors

437
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,240
then you can switch it out take them out

438
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,459
of the hydrogen peroxide wipe them down

439
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,500
with a clean wipe and with fresh gloves

440
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,439
and then you're very sure that you're

441
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:19,019
clean from um from any viruses being

442
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:22,140
present but of course there are ways to

443
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:24,359
Simply in insulate your plants from ever

444
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,240
being infected by viruses as they're

445
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,759
mechanically transferred you can sort of

446
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,440
if you were to test if you're cloning

447
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,298
for example you would be able to test

448
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,220
your mother's and determine we're free

449
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:37,740
of viruses and and then you could sort

450
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,019
of be a little bit a little bit safer

451
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,240
without doing these really intense

452
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:44,038
cleaning regimens as long as you're on

453
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,919
top of what is coming in and out of your

454
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:48,480
your grow or your garden got it that's

455
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,299
pretty straightforward

456
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,360
okay let's get into some viroids and

457
00:17:51,298 --> 00:17:57,058
viruses let's start with hop latent

458
00:17:54,359 --> 00:18:00,599
viral disease what is that

459
00:17:57,058 --> 00:18:04,319
so uh hop late and viroid or what is it

460
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:06,359
HP lvd it's uh the the acronyms are

461
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:09,058
getting a little bit long at this point

462
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:12,178
but basically this is a virus that was

463
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:15,240
probably sitting around in hops for you

464
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:17,340
know who knows many many decades in hops

465
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,200
as the name implies it's latent it

466
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:21,058
doesn't do anything in hops it doesn't

467
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,120
cause any symptoms it just sits around

468
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:27,298
they're just an asymptomatic carrier but

469
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:30,719
uh recently it hopped over uh sorry for

470
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:34,079
the pun it moved over from hops to the

471
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,839
very close uh genetic uh closely related

472
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,759
species you know newly deregulated

473
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:41,639
medicinal plants where it hopped over

474
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:44,400
and it contaminated those those crops

475
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,740
where it is not simply latent virus

476
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,679
anymore now it is very damaging it

477
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,480
causes uh what's called dudding or just

478
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,080
general stunting

479
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:57,000
it reduces yields by you know up to 55

480
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:58,439
in some cases and it's really

481
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,259
devastating some of these industries

482
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:05,220
where it's hopped over to

483
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:07,079
apologies again for the funds but uh

484
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,200
this is something that really came out

485
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:12,178
of the blue around half a decade ago so

486
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,340
there was not good standard operating

487
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:15,840
procedures to protect against it and by

488
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:18,480
the time it was noticed it was all

489
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,959
across North America uh causing these

490
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,900
serious economic Harms now if we this is

491
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,640
why IPM is such an important thing for

492
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,200
everyone to take into account and why

493
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,960
you've got to look at these systems

494
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,419
holistically because if we were using an

495
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,579
IPM mindset we would be prepared for

496
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:37,679
this you know we would say oh well it

497
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:39,659
hasn't come into my grow yet because I

498
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,360
look at this basic layer of defense and

499
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:45,240
I say well if I invest in that I don't

500
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:46,859
have to deal with these huge huge costs

501
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,720
of fighting something like this after it

502
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:50,699
comes in comes into play

503
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,319
okay and those cleaning techniques that

504
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,960
you mentioned a little while ago that'll

505
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,819
help prevent it right or resolve the

506
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,279
issue right so if they're doing cuts on

507
00:19:56,819 --> 00:20:01,918
a plant that has a blatant viral disease

508
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,259
and they go ahead and do that soak wipe

509
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,299
off the Tremors go to their next Plant

510
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:08,640
it should not have spread to the next

511
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:11,819
plant is that correct exactly it

512
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,100
wouldn't spread over so if you uh the

513
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:16,500
the real issue is bringing in a clone

514
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:18,000
and saying oh this we know we need to

515
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,119
grow this clone and then you grow that

516
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,819
mother and then all of its uh all of its

517
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,079
subsequent Offspring Have This virus and

518
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:26,519
then that's just increasing the

519
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:29,038
likelihood that it's going to be spread

520
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:31,319
from one plant to another but crucially

521
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,960
these viruses are spread mechanically

522
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:36,298
they're spread physically in the case of

523
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,980
uh like tobacco Mosaic it can be

524
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:40,319
literally leaves rubbing against each

525
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,839
other luckily hoplite and virus isn't

526
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,519
necessarily that virulent but it's

527
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:47,279
important to note when we're discussing

528
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:49,619
this this is very a very new virus in

529
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,720
reality you know five year years ago was

530
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:53,759
last detected you know three years ago

531
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,620
it really began being studied so we

532
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,419
don't necessarily know 100 on some of

533
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:59,699
these things but it is physically

534
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:01,559
transferred so you can prevent that

535
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,480
through standard operating procedures so

536
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:06,240
it could certainly be on clones I've

537
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,339
heard it can also be on seeds is that

538
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,839
true or not true yeah certainly it's

539
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:12,178
it's debatable this is another thing

540
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,639
that we don't really know anecdotally it

541
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:18,000
certainly ha there's an idea that it's

542
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,640
spread on seeds I think it's clear that

543
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,099
if it can be on any surface obviously it

544
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,500
can be on the surface of a seed there is

545
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:28,918
some research showing that it will not

546
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,839
actually be in the seed from the

547
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:33,600
pollinating plant like if the

548
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:35,399
pollinating plant had the virus but the

549
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,259
plant that's being pollinated and is

550
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,120
growing the seeds doesn't have the virus

551
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:42,240
then it's not going to be transferred

552
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:45,058
into pollen but obviously if that seed

553
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,179
is grown within a virally infected plant

554
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:49,678
it is going to be at least coated so

555
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:52,140
there are things that we can do to fight

556
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,840
this we can clean our seeds and we can

557
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:57,780
heat or or freeze the seeds to kill this

558
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:59,939
virus but that's uh you know it's been

559
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:02,158
related to a sort of a chemotherapy

560
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,220
approach where it's like this is a this

561
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:08,460
is a harmful medicine you know it can

562
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:10,200
cause uh cause a lot of damage so it's

563
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,159
it can certainly be spread by the seeds

564
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,500
and this is why it's kind of a

565
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,179
frightening frightening thing to fight

566
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,859
talk a little bit deeper about the the

567
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:19,620
cleaning of the seeds that you mentioned

568
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:22,558
you said uh two things what was it clean

569
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:26,038
the seeds and then heat the seeds yeah

570
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:28,259
so you can um heat or cool them and

571
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:30,480
there's actually been some tests on you

572
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:32,279
know can we take a plant that's infested

573
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,140
with this virus what if we just heat it

574
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:36,000
up a lot what if we cool it down a lot

575
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,320
can we just kill off the virus it's the

576
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,240
same approach

577
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:41,038
um that our bodies would take when

578
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,900
infested with a pathogen right we would

579
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,119
get a fever we would raise our body

580
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:48,840
temperature to a place where that virus

581
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:51,058
wouldn't be able to live now in the uh

582
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:53,579
instances of these crops these heating

583
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:56,759
levels have been have caused like 50

584
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:58,558
kill rates in the plants themselves so

585
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:00,058
it's really severe levels of heat that's

586
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,819
required

587
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:05,879
um in in seeds it's a little bit easier

588
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:07,918
to just freeze them and not damage them

589
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,179
too badly but these effects are always

590
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,038
going to be

591
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,679
kind of harmful kind of last minute

592
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,558
Resorts you could do a seed soak in like

593
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,360
a very slight you know a seed wipe with

594
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,879
a very slight bit of alcohol but again

595
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:23,038
these are you're sort of coming close to

596
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,559
the line of damaging these things

597
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,359
it's best just to start with

598
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:30,298
non-infected seeds right yeah absolutely

599
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:31,979
so how do you detect hoplate and thyroid

600
00:23:30,298 --> 00:23:33,119
diseases they're like testing that can

601
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,038
be done or is there physical

602
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,259
characteristics that somebody could see

603
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,298
on the plant to determine whether they

604
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:41,759
have it or not and once they realize

605
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:43,918
they have it how do they get rid of it

606
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,960
so there's both

607
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,000
um in terms of testing it's a really

608
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,759
Laboratory Testing it's actually a PCR

609
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,380
test uh polymerase Chain Reaction test

610
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:55,140
this is the same test that we learned

611
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,240
about a lot over covid luckily because

612
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:00,299
we've experienced this pandemic not you

613
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,919
know not that there's uh you know it was

614
00:24:00,298 --> 00:24:05,038
a terrible terrible event for all of

615
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,600
humanity but it was very educational and

616
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,700
now we understand a little bit more

617
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,740
about how sneaky viruses can be and how

618
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,538
difficult they can be to fight and how

619
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,519
we need to just instead prevent them so

620
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:17,279
in terms of detecting them there are

621
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:19,859
asymptomatic plants that will just be

622
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,779
spreaders that you can only determine if

623
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:24,119
you're actually taking a bit a taking a

624
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:25,819
flight a tissue sample and sending it to

625
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:28,439
a lab to be tested

626
00:24:25,819 --> 00:24:31,079
but the symptomatic plants you will be

627
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,720
able to to identify them now this is a

628
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:35,158
little bit more tricky and really you

629
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,900
need to be experienced with it to

630
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,659
quickly identify it but it's it's

631
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:42,600
stunting and what's called dudding it's

632
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:45,179
just you know it's sort of similar to an

633
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:47,339
over watering reaction

634
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:50,880
um where this plant just looks unhappy

635
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:53,339
they're very brittle stems they're uh

636
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,100
sort of there's an excess splaying of

637
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:58,439
leaves or of stems and there's just

638
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:01,199
general very slow growth

639
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,519
um and very very reduced growth so I

640
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,319
think it's it's unfortunate because

641
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:05,819
there's um some people who you might go

642
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:07,500
in and say hey

643
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:08,819
you're just a bad Gardener you're just

644
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,859
doing bad here these plants looking

645
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:12,000
happy and he's like oh I don't know what

646
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:13,918
to do I don't know I don't know what it

647
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,038
is I'm trying my best and it's it's well

648
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,960
maybe you have uh this full infestation

649
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,000
that you haven't been able to test but

650
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,640
it just shows up as stunting and you

651
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,740
know 50 reductions in in yield and

652
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:29,038
things like this so that's really the

653
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:31,380
main uh the main sign is stunted plants

654
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,179
if you have you know a couple of plants

655
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,760
and one of them is just looking really

656
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:37,980
sad and stunted I would consider being

657
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,900
very careful around it uh if you have

658
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:42,960
the means send off a tissue sample for

659
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:45,240
testing and also you can just test all

660
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,798
mothers is really the thing to do do you

661
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,778
have a recommended lab that they should

662
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:51,658
send the tissue samples to and how much

663
00:25:48,778 --> 00:25:53,339
does that cost not a specific lab any

664
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:55,559
any Testing Lab is going to be able to

665
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:57,298
pretty easily do these tests

666
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:58,980
um and it's it's not super expensive but

667
00:25:57,298 --> 00:26:01,619
the thing is you know it's less than a

668
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,240
hundred dollars per each tissue sample

669
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:05,819
but the thing is you know in a large

670
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,319
operation you might have a you might

671
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:08,579
have dozens or hundreds of tissue

672
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:10,619
samples that's really where it becomes

673
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:13,379
problematic all right let's move on to

674
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:14,759
Tomato Brown rugros fruit virus did I

675
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:20,120
pronounce that one right

676
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:22,679
s okay with the uh

677
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:24,178
t-o-b-r-f-v the really the acronym

678
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:25,620
that's getting a little bit silly and we

679
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:27,659
need to just just we can just call it

680
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:30,658
rugo's virus you know

681
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:33,720
um but yeah another another virus very

682
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:34,860
similar to the story of uh the hoplite

683
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,620
and viroid

684
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:40,500
so this is one that we're not sure where

685
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:43,019
it came from but it occurred

686
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:46,200
um around half a decade ago in Jordan

687
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:49,440
and Israel in Pepper and tomato uh

688
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,798
greenhouses and it causes you know a lot

689
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,298
of die off a lot of really bad

690
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:55,859
reductions in yield for both tomatoes

691
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:58,558
and peppers

692
00:26:55,859 --> 00:27:01,379
and it's precisely the same in terms of

693
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:04,859
the way that it spreads as as top light

694
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:07,559
and virus or as a tobacco mosaic virus

695
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:11,099
that is mechanical transfer

696
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:13,500
so you can simply prevent it

697
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:15,719
um by identifying it early luckily it's

698
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,000
a lot easier to fit to identify it by

699
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,200
sight and there have been some cases

700
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
where it's come over to the United

701
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,819
States and it's been found in places

702
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,440
like California Arizona and Florida but

703
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:27,000
it's been locked down they've said we

704
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,500
have this we're going to cut down every

705
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,700
plant in this greenhouse we're going to

706
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,679
sterilize everything we're going to

707
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,319
throw out the soil we're going to clean

708
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,720
all of our tools and supposedly it's

709
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,619
been contained in those situations

710
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,360
um

711
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:41,339
kind of debatable it probably is

712
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,859
floating around out there but it's a

713
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:46,139
very serious concern uh much like a hot

714
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:48,359
blade and viroid and can you do the

715
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,220
similar testing that you mentioned for

716
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:53,038
hot blade and to where you can send off

717
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,860
a tissue sample to a laboratory and pay

718
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:58,980
a certain amount to get it tested

719
00:27:55,859 --> 00:28:01,859
precisely so it's uh it's we're fairly

720
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,319
good at testing for viruses and with in

721
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:07,678
the case of rugos it's pretty apparent

722
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:09,839
so you'll have your fruit be yellowed

723
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,320
and have large lesions all over the

724
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:15,899
fruit it's the brown term but you also

725
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:17,220
have yellowing and die off of leaves so

726
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,259
it's a little more it's a little more

727
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:22,740
aggressive than the Hop light and viroid

728
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:25,140
so it's easier to see earlier on but it

729
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:27,179
is very similar one thing to note is

730
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:30,059
that we can

731
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:33,419
there are situations where if we had a

732
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:35,460
really crucial uh cultivar uh you know

733
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:36,960
very specific strain of tomatoes that we

734
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,700
really want to serve we really want to

735
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,700
live we've put in a lot of investment

736
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,679
into breeding it but it's infected

737
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,259
um and we have to kill it there are

738
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,778
situations where you can find certain

739
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:51,960
tissue in that plant that is not

740
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:54,058
infected namely like very new growth and

741
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,038
you can take a little sample of that and

742
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:58,678
you can culture it clone it through

743
00:28:56,038 --> 00:29:01,140
culturing and save that strain it's the

744
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,759
same with a hoplite enviroid okay so

745
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,860
there's no way of actually like nursing

746
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:06,359
it back to life it would just be it's

747
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:08,339
infected with the virus you got to kill

748
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:10,619
it off unless you can get some of that

749
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:12,240
new growth tissue off of that and

750
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:14,519
continue on

751
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,079
yeah I mean it's it's really a situation

752
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:19,200
where you could struggle through and

753
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,879
accept like a 50 loss in yield but I

754
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,558
would say you have to think about the

755
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,140
the industry as a whole especially in

756
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,819
tomatoes I mean everybody else is going

757
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,399
to be pretty upset with you if you're if

758
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:31,379
you don't just destroy a a tomato

759
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:33,599
Greenhouse that's infested because it

760
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,539
will be spreading uh to the industry as

761
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,579
a whole so this is what we see with

762
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:39,778
tobacco mosaic virus it's just endemic

763
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:41,879
at this point we've been dealing with it

764
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,140
for a hundred years and it's not going

765
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,778
anywhere

766
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:47,880
um we're at a point with uh rugos for

767
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:50,339
tomatoes where can you know we're still

768
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,700
insulated here in America from it we

769
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:56,038
conceivably we can still perhaps through

770
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,480
really good operating practices prevent

771
00:29:56,038 --> 00:30:00,000
it or at least hold it off for many

772
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,620
years until we can uh find a more

773
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,778
effective way to actually fight it but

774
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:06,119
in terms of curing a plant that's

775
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:07,619
infected with it it's that's it's not

776
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:10,019
going to happen

777
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:13,199
um perhaps these Extreme Hot and Cold

778
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:14,940
therapies but even then

779
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,399
you know you may just be slowing this

780
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,600
down you mentioned TMV a couple times I

781
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,819
like to get a little bit deeper into

782
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:22,139
that uh you did a brief explanation of

783
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:25,200
it is there anything more to say about

784
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:27,240
like what TMV is and kind of how to go

785
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,460
about detecting it and preventing it

786
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,399
right well I'd say it's something really

787
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,140
to look to because these new viruses

788
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:36,658
that we're talking about in tomatoes and

789
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,399
in medicinal crops these are less than

790
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:40,799
half a decade old the research has not

791
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:42,658
been done the the really quick

792
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,759
identification has not been developed

793
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:46,559
yet so I would say

794
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,839
um mosaic virus is one that you can look

795
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:51,000
to and you can say here's a century of

796
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:52,678
research you know dig into that and you

797
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,778
you can really it can help you to

798
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:57,240
prepare and you can take those operating

799
00:30:54,778 --> 00:30:58,500
practices over which really are what

800
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,960
we've been talking about they're just

801
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,960
heavy sterilization processes careful

802
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,819
sterilization in the case of large

803
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,919
tobacco crops it's um

804
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:09,178
when the soil is infected with their

805
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,000
contaminated soil and you can't just

806
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:14,340
throw it out because it's the ground you

807
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,679
do crop rotation where a field will be

808
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:18,839
fallow for up to two years to actually

809
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:20,820
really let that virus die off before you

810
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:24,240
come back to that field so I would say

811
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:26,519
it's it's a very good uh resource to

812
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,620
look to to sort of train yourself and

813
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:30,179
see what is this industry done over a

814
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:32,099
hundred years to deal with what is now

815
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:34,200
an endemic virus all right and then I

816
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:35,819
imagine one of the easy ways to prevent

817
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,179
it is just not to smoke around your

818
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:41,579
plants right is this only cigarettes or

819
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:43,860
is it anything else you smoke as well

820
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:46,019
it's these viruses are very very

821
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:48,418
virulent they're happy to live on the

822
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:50,700
surfaces of something so it's it's hard

823
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:53,220
to understand but even in the case of

824
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,380
when a plant is dried you know broken

825
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,419
down rolled up put in a cigarette and

826
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,640
smoked later there can still be one or

827
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:01,500
two virus particles on there that get on

828
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,419
your hand that get on your face and then

829
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,940
you transfer to your crop so yeah I

830
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:07,620
would say it applies generally uh Beyond

831
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,419
just tobacco it's something to watch out

832
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:12,538
for it's something that is not confirmed

833
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:14,399
or denied as a word but it's you know

834
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:16,259
it's just best operating procedures to

835
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:20,339
be careful I made the mistake in the

836
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:22,379
past of confusing TMV with variation and

837
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:25,259
so they I apparently they look very

838
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,419
similar one is just a natural occurring

839
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:30,298
thing in the plant the other is an

840
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:32,220
actual virus is there any easier way to

841
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:34,379
kind of you know separate the two so

842
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,839
people don't get confused

843
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,340
yeah I would say you know the

844
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:40,199
variegation it's funny because it's

845
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:43,139
actually a very valuable trait even in

846
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,600
some um in uh Flora culture and so if

847
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,880
you get a breed of uh roses for example

848
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,678
with variegation you can uh make a

849
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,260
pretty penny off of it but I would say

850
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,500
it's this is a holistic approach where

851
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:57,658
you say okay I'm seeing this variegation

852
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:59,819
I let's put it in the back of my mind

853
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:01,440
and maybe it's Mosaic but let's let's

854
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:03,778
wait until we see some other symptoms

855
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,298
show up as well some stunting if there's

856
00:33:03,778 --> 00:33:08,038
variegation and stunting you know if

857
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:12,200
there's uh if there's variegation and

858
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:14,940
lesions occurring or if it's very

859
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:18,058
small modeled variegation you know

860
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:20,340
typical genetic variegation will be like

861
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:22,379
larger swathes of sort of lighter

862
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:25,500
colored versus darker colored Mosaic

863
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:27,120
will be really tight tight little uh

864
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,798
tight little differentiations in color

865
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,319
almost to the point of like stippling

866
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:34,798
from a bad Spider-Man infestation but uh

867
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:36,000
let's transition over into pests there

868
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,398
are so many different pests that

869
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,380
gardeners can come across as they are on

870
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:42,418
their journey and there are a lot of

871
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,519
common ones that come up more often than

872
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:46,860
others let's start with fungus gnats

873
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,980
this is one that I have been battling so

874
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:52,619
much over the past 12 plus years and

875
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:55,919
they are certainly a pest they're

876
00:33:52,619 --> 00:33:58,379
nuisance they can rapidly increase the

877
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,880
population talk to us about fungus gnats

878
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,380
what are they how do you prevent them

879
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,840
and if you do have a full-blown

880
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:06,360
infestation what can you do

881
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:08,039
you have such a frustrating pest I mean

882
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:10,319
really you're correct calling it a

883
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:12,659
nuisance I personally get so frustrated

884
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,280
when I have just gnats just buzzing

885
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:16,800
around they're they're incredibly

886
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:19,619
frustrating and you know this is an

887
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,119
insect that unlike uh other insects that

888
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:23,399
thrive on the undersides of leaves

889
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,679
they're thriving down in the soil so

890
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:28,378
they're much harder to identify ahead of

891
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,240
time much harder to actively treat you

892
00:34:28,378 --> 00:34:32,759
have to do a root flush rather than just

893
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,918
spraying something so it's very uh

894
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,859
they're very frustrating plant I mean I

895
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:42,059
would say this comes back to if you look

896
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:44,940
at the the Pyramid of uh you know of of

897
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:46,619
priorities for IPM when you the bottom

898
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:48,960
of the pyramid the largest segment is

899
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:51,119
just do preventative passive maintenance

900
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,519
I would say that really comes into play

901
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,700
with fungus gnats because they're a

902
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:58,920
species that thrive in wet soil so I

903
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:00,659
would say first of all just really

904
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,960
proper drainage which may be difficult

905
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:05,159
in the cases of rockwool Cubes of a

906
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,960
really proper drainage you can look at

907
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:10,739
things like air pots things like

908
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:13,858
elevating pots and just uh or um

909
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:16,799
fabric pots excuse me and then

910
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:18,598
not uh not over watering if you're in a

911
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,700
drip irrigation system this is kind of

912
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:22,260
impossible to avoid but I would really

913
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:24,358
recommend there's some people who are

914
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,940
very big proponents of allowing plants

915
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:30,358
to fully dry before next watering is

916
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:32,159
applied and with the quick life cycle of

917
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:34,440
a fungus nuts like we talked about with

918
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:35,940
the intralite solution our best

919
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,800
application our most efficient

920
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,659
application is when they're short life

921
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,599
cycles it's the same thing with allowing

922
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:46,078
roots to really dry out because there's

923
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:48,000
such a quick life cycle of fungus gnats

924
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,640
that if there's just a few days of dry

925
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,219
soil you can damage them and then do

926
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:54,960
that over the next over the next week if

927
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:56,879
there's a handful of days where the soil

928
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,280
is really dry you'll really damage that

929
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,800
population okay I know you mentioned

930
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,420
diatomaceous earth in the past it's fun

931
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,579
things that you like to do and that can

932
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,619
definitely help do some damage on the

933
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:10,380
fungus gnats can you talk deeper about

934
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:12,059
diatomaceous earth like how much do you

935
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,980
apply when do you apply what does it

936
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:15,719
actually do to the fungus gnats

937
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,838
yeah diets make sure this is a really

938
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:21,358
interesting one you know so uh

939
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:24,119
Diatomaceous mean from diatoms so really

940
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:27,299
it's it's a incredible thing because

941
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:30,420
this is a a mineral a sort of a mineral

942
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:32,460
that's actually the skeletons of um

943
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:36,000
ancient little tiny creatures that have

944
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:38,820
silica skeletons that are now just uh

945
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,619
huge sand deposits of fossils of ancient

946
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:43,740
microorganisms that are essentially

947
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:46,260
incredibly spiky microscopic balls of

948
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:48,598
silica silica obviously silica gel that

949
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:52,500
you get in your shoe box it absorbs

950
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:55,440
water so the actual method of uh of the

951
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:58,500
kill method of Diatomaceous Earth is uh

952
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,320
pretty dark um you know it's uh it'll

953
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:04,260
get stuck in the joints of um an insect

954
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:06,960
or you know in in the skin of a of a

955
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,420
larva and it those tiny little sharp

956
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,820
Corners will slice the skin or slice

957
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:14,159
into the creature and then the silica

958
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:17,099
naturally will suck water out and

959
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:19,199
desiccate the creature so it's but

960
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:22,680
crucially it's a physical method of

961
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:25,019
killing this insect so there's no can no

962
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:27,118
kind of contamination diatomaceous earth

963
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:29,699
is totally okay to be exposed to you

964
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,740
don't want to inhale a ton of it but um

965
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:32,699
there's some people will will eat some

966
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:35,159
of it

967
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:37,259
um to supposedly clean out parasites

968
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:40,319
inside their own bodies so it's a very

969
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:43,140
safe for humans and it's very easy to

970
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,359
apply so in terms of application rates

971
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:47,219
for something like

972
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:48,420
um for something like fungus gnats I

973
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:50,639
would just use this as a preventative

974
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:52,139
apply a thin layer of Diatomaceous Earth

975
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,000
through the top of your soil or to the

976
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:56,219
top of your medium and then just keep an

977
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,139
eye on it um you know as you water it it

978
00:37:56,219 --> 00:38:00,179
will get sort of moved around and

979
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:01,559
knocked down to that soil so when it

980
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:03,299
looks like you know there's not much

981
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:05,519
left go ahead and apply another thin

982
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,440
layer just to you don't need to do a

983
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:10,380
thick layer of diatomaceous earth I mean

984
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,880
if you're if any insect walks it over it

985
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,500
it's going to be stuck in them and

986
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,760
they're gonna they're gonna die so you

987
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,858
don't need some kind of really thick

988
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:21,420
layer of it which is why it's so nice to

989
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:23,699
use you can use sort of a sprayer to

990
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:25,079
apply it directly to leaves I've never

991
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:26,279
really been a big fan of that it's just

992
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:29,460
kind of awkward

993
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,800
and uh not super effective but if you

994
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,659
did have a really big infestation you

995
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,280
could do some little dousing of dye to

996
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:36,960
make sure to fight that

997
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,420
okay and there are so many different

998
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,460
sprays that can be used as well right I

999
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:44,400
mean I've used so much over the years

1000
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:47,400
everything from hydrogen peroxide which

1001
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,599
apparently harms The larva I mean I

1002
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,900
tried bleach that didn't do anything

1003
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:54,000
alcohol is another home remedy that you

1004
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:56,400
read up online but those things really

1005
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,440
didn't help me to be honest with you a

1006
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,380
couple things that did help was Dr zymes

1007
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,659
which is like an all-natural proprietary

1008
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,640
blend I think it's just of essential

1009
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:07,618
oils it could be something else that had

1010
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:10,400
helped reduce the population I also

1011
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:14,039
recently picked up Mammoth can control

1012
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,660
which is a corn oil and a thyme oil that

1013
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:17,460
has greatly helped reduce the population

1014
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:18,838
so you know we could sit here and talk

1015
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,579
about fungus nest for the next 30

1016
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:22,380
minutes if we really wanted to there are

1017
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:25,560
a ton of different solutions that people

1018
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:27,000
can explore on preventing and battling

1019
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:29,578
fungus nests so I just wanted to say

1020
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,679
that one certainly things like green

1021
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:34,200
cleaner and those essential oil-based

1022
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:36,899
ones are really effective if you're if

1023
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:39,179
you feel like I need need to apply a

1024
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:41,160
spray these other Solutions you know

1025
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:42,598
there are situations in IPM where the

1026
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:44,639
bottom of the pyramid the passive

1027
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:46,859
results they were effective for a while

1028
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:49,078
but we've gone past them so what's the

1029
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:51,059
next layer and I think you can use

1030
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:53,640
sprays like those essential oil sprays

1031
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:55,139
insecticidal soaps that are sprays and

1032
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:59,699
are effective but they're not these

1033
00:39:55,139 --> 00:40:01,679
horrific you know Avid or azimax more

1034
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:03,118
very serious pesticides that can be

1035
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,639
debatably a little bit dangerous to be

1036
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,440
exposed to how about spider mites talk

1037
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:09,239
to us about them next you know what are

1038
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,800
they how do you prevent them and how do

1039
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:13,078
you deal with a full-blown infestation

1040
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,260
yeah so spider mites for me are really

1041
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:18,119
one that's like not terrible terribly

1042
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,380
difficult to deal with

1043
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:22,019
um they're really one that's like

1044
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:24,780
they're it's frustrating but if you

1045
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:27,539
train your eye you will see stippling

1046
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:30,060
like really early on and then you'll be

1047
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:32,338
able to Target those hot spots if they

1048
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:34,199
occur past your initial levels of

1049
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:35,639
Defense you'll be able to Target them

1050
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:38,098
quickly and eradicate them pretty

1051
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:40,019
quickly so spider mites and typically

1052
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:43,440
we're talking about red spotted spider

1053
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:45,179
mites are really incredibly common pests

1054
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,338
and what you want to look out for for

1055
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:50,338
them is as I said that's stippling and

1056
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:51,838
also their waste on the plants so when

1057
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:54,179
you look through your grow

1058
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:56,460
you want to note stippling is little

1059
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:57,960
yellow dots along the surface of the

1060
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:01,199
plant of the surface of the leaves so

1061
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:04,559
it's a result of on the on the underside

1062
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:06,779
a spider miter and aphid rasping away

1063
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:09,119
sucking the moisture out of that leaf in

1064
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:11,820
that spot and then you also might see a

1065
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,380
sort of a sticky looking little shiny um

1066
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,660
little dots around the leaves as well

1067
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:18,420
which will be an example of there their

1068
00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:20,039
waste so one thing to note that's

1069
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,260
frustrating about spider mites and that

1070
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:23,820
comes up a lot as well with thrips is

1071
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,740
that they do have the ability to

1072
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,359
asexually reproduce so typically they

1073
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:28,919
lay eggs and then males come and

1074
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:30,960
fertilize the eggs and that's how they

1075
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,180
reproduce but they have sort of a

1076
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,400
secondary mechanism where a

1077
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:36,960
non-fertilized egg can hatch it'll just

1078
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,059
only hatch into I believe they only

1079
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,740
hatch into males or they only hatch into

1080
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:44,039
females I'm not sure exactly which but

1081
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:45,779
the fertilized eggs are able to hatch so

1082
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:48,239
it's a situation where

1083
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:50,339
if one survives you know and it's a

1084
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,679
female it's going to lay an egg legs and

1085
00:41:50,338 --> 00:41:53,759
continue to operate so I would really

1086
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:56,279
say

1087
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,420
um you know one of the early defense

1088
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,300
layers

1089
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:02,820
is just physically protecting your

1090
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,260
environment quarantining you know the

1091
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,820
question is how are they getting into

1092
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,440
your environment if it is carefully

1093
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:09,000
sealed I know there are a lot of

1094
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,400
situations where it can't be fully

1095
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,500
sealed but if it's an indoor or a

1096
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,260
well-sealed greenhouse how are they

1097
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:18,358
coming in the answer is either in clones

1098
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:21,000
or new cultivars you're bringing in or

1099
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:23,039
really on us you know we are the big

1100
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,539
vehicle they come in on especially if

1101
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:26,159
you know if your dog you take your dog

1102
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:28,079
for a hike and he's running around and

1103
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:30,779
then you come and pet him it's that is

1104
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,300
just that's the way so I would say

1105
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:35,820
having grow specific clothes you know

1106
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:38,220
not going directly from a hike directly

1107
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,900
in to take care of things just prevent

1108
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:41,939
them in the first place and then we can

1109
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,680
talk about actively fighting them

1110
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,480
um sort of if we have to go up that next

1111
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:47,338
stage of the pyramid yeah I know a

1112
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,500
couple of things would be to change the

1113
00:42:47,338 --> 00:42:52,019
environment talk about making it colder

1114
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,940
right they Thrive and hot environments

1115
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:56,159
making it more windy maybe it's harder

1116
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:58,260
for them to actually you know congregate

1117
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:01,078
around in your canopy if it's it's

1118
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:02,760
windier predator mites as well right so

1119
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,980
can you talk about that a little bit

1120
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,960
Yeah predator mites are really excellent

1121
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:08,760
and I've seen some situations where

1122
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,260
people will say they want a stippling

1123
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,819
but they'll notice mites and they'll be

1124
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,440
like Oh I'm infested what is this crazy

1125
00:43:11,818 --> 00:43:14,880
thing and it's like no they're those are

1126
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,920
friendly they're just helpful little

1127
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,440
bugs so predatory mites as well as

1128
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:23,880
obviously the classic is ladybugs

1129
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:26,280
um and the real um the one is a cocumas

1130
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,019
um mites is a common one but there's you

1131
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,640
know many species of special little mice

1132
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:32,280
that you can get that will just

1133
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:35,039
just really eat those up this is where

1134
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,720
we get into if you look at an IPM system

1135
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,460
and you say here's everything that I

1136
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:41,219
have in my disposal

1137
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:43,318
um you might say okay let's just throw

1138
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:45,179
everything throw everything we can at

1139
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:47,940
them but that comes into negative

1140
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:50,338
synergies if you are to deploy these

1141
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:53,099
beneficial uh beneficial mites you have

1142
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:55,980
to then stop deploying other other

1143
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:58,619
pesticides the May well kill uh kill

1144
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:00,440
your beneficial insects and to what you

1145
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:03,059
were saying about temperature and

1146
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:05,338
humidity the same thing will be the case

1147
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:07,440
on your predatory mites so they'll

1148
00:44:05,338 --> 00:44:10,739
they'll die or they'll be reduced just

1149
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,900
as much if you have cold nights but

1150
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:15,179
really temperature control is such a

1151
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,680
beneficial like just passive way to deal

1152
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:18,719
with this this is sort of why we see in

1153
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:21,179
Northern California you would expect

1154
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:23,159
like oh these should be covered in in

1155
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:25,799
spider mites right but often you have

1156
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:28,019
those really cold foggy mornings that

1157
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,760
come in and it just reduces their

1158
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:32,818
ability to reproduce really drastically

1159
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,780
and naturally fights them off but

1160
00:44:32,818 --> 00:44:36,119
certainly

1161
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:39,720
but I'm a big fan of beneficials I think

1162
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:43,019
sort of the Pyramid of IPM is like just

1163
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:44,879
passive defense and then scouting and

1164
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:46,500
active to fit like sort of first stage

1165
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,079
active defense which is I'm going to

1166
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:51,420
deploy some some spider mites and then

1167
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,760
you know a little more or some some uh

1168
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,960
some beneficial mites or some ladybugs a

1169
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,940
little bit more active I'm going to

1170
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,059
deploy some insecticidal soaps some

1171
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:01,500
chemicals that I feel are safe and then

1172
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:03,059
last resort you know the tip of the

1173
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,760
pyramid is you know I'm going to use

1174
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:07,380
some some debate at least some some

1175
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,920
pretty bad stuff

1176
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:12,960
um one thing I would note here is that I

1177
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,000
think it often overlooked approach to

1178
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,559
stopping something like spider mites

1179
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,300
this is not an approach that will work

1180
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:20,279
for something like fungus gnats because

1181
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,380
they're living in the soil but something

1182
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,519
like for spider mites you can use a bait

1183
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,200
plant

1184
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:26,699
um which I think it's a really have you

1185
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:29,519
ever had experience with using a bait

1186
00:45:26,699 --> 00:45:31,679
plant no no so it's you gotta ask

1187
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:34,559
yourself like if if the spider mite has

1188
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:36,659
a series of five different plants which

1189
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:38,460
ones is it going to go to First and

1190
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:40,679
it'll typically Target you know just

1191
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:42,119
like we have a preferred fruit that

1192
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:44,899
we'll go after spider mites have

1193
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:47,579
preferred plants so there's a lot of um

1194
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:50,160
plants that you can use to attract

1195
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:51,300
specifically to attract them and then if

1196
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:54,420
you're not going to consume that plant

1197
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:56,880
you can use really harsh chemicals you

1198
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,800
can impregnate it with uh chemicals that

1199
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,500
you would certainly not want to use for

1200
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,000
uh consuming the produce but you can

1201
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,159
just have it as a bait plant where the

1202
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,139
spider mites go there and they get uh

1203
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:09,358
they consume some some serious uh

1204
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:11,639
serious chemicals I think bean plants

1205
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:13,078
are a really common one for uh for

1206
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:15,420
spider mites but it's just an often

1207
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:17,039
overlooked approach I think people are

1208
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,260
concerned about like they I don't want

1209
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:21,358
to put something that attracts pests

1210
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:23,220
into my into my grow but it's an

1211
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:24,900
interesting approach if uh if you don't

1212
00:46:23,219 --> 00:46:26,818
want to if you don't want to go to

1213
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,740
spraying chemicals directly

1214
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:30,420
yeah that is an interesting approach and

1215
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:32,098
something that I I assume that a lot of

1216
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,720
people don't think of that they can do

1217
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:35,640
so yeah thanks for pointing that one out

1218
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:38,159
let's go over one more I want to go over

1219
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:39,838
thrips what are thrips how do you

1220
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:41,940
prevent them and how do you deal with an

1221
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:44,578
infestation if it were to happen

1222
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:46,440
yeah a frustrating one so another that

1223
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:49,440
has the

1224
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:51,480
um the lack of uh or the the ability to

1225
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,700
asexually reproduce

1226
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,679
um it's such a great defense mechanism

1227
00:46:53,699 --> 00:46:57,239
that they have where they just their

1228
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:00,000
non-fertilized eggs will still reproduce

1229
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:01,439
so thrips are one that just I've had

1230
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,559
really frustrating experiences with

1231
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,300
thrips where they just refuse to leave

1232
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:07,980
um I think it can be a bit overblown if

1233
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,900
you have one to two thrips

1234
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:11,760
and you're keeping that population down

1235
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:14,039
it's not going to be a big issue they're

1236
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,260
not as incredibly harmful as other

1237
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:18,719
insects but if a population grows they

1238
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:21,540
are a serious harm so I would say if a

1239
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:23,399
big population pops up you know I I

1240
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:24,838
would have I would have an intralites

1241
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,940
set up so that it would be consistently

1242
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:28,078
damaging them but say it got unplugged

1243
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,400
or whatever

1244
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:32,099
um you're gonna need to actively

1245
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:35,160
actively fight against them uh there are

1246
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:37,140
I would say beneficial insects if you

1247
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:39,838
can apply them you know they're very

1248
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:43,078
easily targeted by various Predators

1249
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:44,880
like Green Lace Wings will just have a

1250
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:47,220
field day especially if you take care of

1251
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,960
them if you're aware that you're growing

1252
00:47:47,219 --> 00:47:51,598
your crops but you're also growing your

1253
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,460
Green Lace Wings to fight thrips you'll

1254
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,960
have a really good luck with uh with

1255
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,480
defeating them in those beneficials but

1256
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,760
if you can't I would move up to a Next

1257
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,800
Level if if you just can't get rid of

1258
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,060
these thrips I would consider one thing

1259
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,460
that we haven't discussed is a pH

1260
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:07,440
balancing of leaf surfaces you can just

1261
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:10,679
go ahead and go in and either spray with

1262
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,000
sulfur or use a sulfur burner in a

1263
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:14,879
greenhouse for example or a larger

1264
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,679
facility to just mess up the pH of the

1265
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,559
surface those leaves so they can no

1266
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:21,480
longer can no longer live and then the

1267
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:22,759
other things that I would look at is

1268
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,619
you know

1269
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,260
insecticidal soaps the things that we

1270
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:29,099
were discussing like essential oil

1271
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,599
concoctions you can make these yourself

1272
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:32,940
or you can purchase them like Green

1273
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:36,180
Cleaner or um

1274
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:38,760
or you know trusting neem oil but I

1275
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:40,980
think uh these are

1276
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,380
you might get to a point where

1277
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:45,539
you don't want to go to really powerful

1278
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:47,519
chemicals but you need to physically

1279
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:48,539
apply a chemical but it's not as

1280
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:50,338
effective as the really powerful

1281
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:52,679
chemicals you have to apply more of it

1282
00:48:50,338 --> 00:48:54,299
and at a greater rate and I think it's

1283
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:56,818
easy to get locked into the situation

1284
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,680
where you're like I I refuse to apply

1285
00:48:56,818 --> 00:49:01,679
this really this chemical that I feel

1286
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:03,779
may be harmful it's a really powerful so

1287
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:06,480
I'm going to go one step down but I have

1288
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:08,880
to apply it a lot and the the the fault

1289
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,980
will be a lack of consistency the thing

1290
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,619
will be like you just missed one

1291
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:16,139
application and that's enough you know

1292
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:18,599
it'll be like over over Years you'll be

1293
00:49:16,139 --> 00:49:21,299
applying it every two weeks but every

1294
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:23,039
six weeks you'll miss a treatment and

1295
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,380
it'll just be a Perpetual thing so I

1296
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:28,199
would say when you're using these active

1297
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:30,240
uh active approaches that aren't

1298
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:32,219
necessarily incredibly efficient but

1299
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:35,118
still work pretty well just be very

1300
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:37,739
consistent wall always keeping in mind

1301
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:40,318
the lower levels of the IPM pyramid

1302
00:49:37,739 --> 00:49:42,239
sealing your environment consistent

1303
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:43,858
passive approach to protecting your

1304
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:46,500
plants making sure there's not an influx

1305
00:49:43,858 --> 00:49:47,639
of new plants there are a few pests I

1306
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,619
think that's some really good advice

1307
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:51,539
what other advice do you have for maybe

1308
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,858
some new gardeners brand new to the game

1309
00:49:51,539 --> 00:49:53,699
is there anything else you could tell

1310
00:49:52,858 --> 00:49:56,098
them

1311
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:57,358
well I would really say

1312
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:59,160
um like you know I don't want to repeat

1313
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:01,980
myself too much but I would say you need

1314
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:04,559
to approach this as holistic I think

1315
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:06,599
it's very easy to be like I love I'm so

1316
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:08,338
excited to grow a plant to harvest it

1317
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:10,200
you know I'm looking at what I can feed

1318
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:13,559
it I'm watching it grow I'm very happy

1319
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:15,358
and then a pest comes in and it's like

1320
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:17,940
that wasn't even

1321
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:19,739
in your in your world view that you

1322
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:21,900
would get a pest infestation and you're

1323
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:24,299
shocked by it and then you're scrambling

1324
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:27,240
to chase it you need to look at this as

1325
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:29,700
a holistic thing you are growing a plant

1326
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:31,799
that is you know has the genetic

1327
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:34,139
capability to convert sunlight into a

1328
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:36,359
beneficial food source everyone's

1329
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:39,059
interested in it not just humans you

1330
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:40,500
know a one uh phrase that I love is that

1331
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:42,420
when you're you're creating a perfect

1332
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,980
environment for your plants you're also

1333
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:46,680
creating a perfect environment for their

1334
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:48,719
pests so you just need to be holistic

1335
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:51,598
and view this

1336
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:52,799
include IPM and include the pests that

1337
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,900
are going to be coming in in your

1338
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,400
mindset from day one and you'll just be

1339
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:59,280
so much more prepared it's all about

1340
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,200
passive defense consistent passive

1341
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,059
protection so that you're not you just

1342
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:05,399
never want to scramble to protect these

1343
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:06,240
so and that applies in other ways as

1344
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,980
well

1345
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:10,139
um to things like fertilization you

1346
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:12,659
don't want to notice that you have a

1347
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:15,480
deficiency and fight to fix it you want

1348
00:51:12,659 --> 00:51:17,818
to just view the entire picture at once

1349
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:20,099
and not have these issues crop up

1350
00:51:17,818 --> 00:51:22,019
and I would say you know just don't be

1351
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:24,780
scared dig into it you know everybody

1352
00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:26,579
everybody has lots of dead plants in

1353
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:29,160
their hands it's okay it's a it's a

1354
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:31,440
great hobby so dig in one thing that

1355
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:34,139
interests me is upcoming Technologies

1356
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,519
you talked about that a little bit you

1357
00:51:34,139 --> 00:51:37,558
know with the intro light did you want

1358
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:39,000
to get deeper into the intro light is

1359
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:40,859
there any other upcoming technologies

1360
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,358
that relate to combating pests or

1361
00:51:40,858 --> 00:51:43,920
pathogens

1362
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:45,779
yeah so there's a lot of new crop

1363
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,059
protection Technologies coming on coming

1364
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:50,400
onto the field so obviously I'm a big

1365
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:53,339
proponent of intralite where we use LEDs

1366
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:56,099
to just flash a little 60-second burst

1367
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:58,139
of pesticidal light every 24 hours where

1368
00:51:56,099 --> 00:52:00,119
this can be properly applied it's going

1369
00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:02,400
to be a really beneficial easy way for

1370
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:04,559
you to protect your crops beyond that

1371
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,380
you know that's a situation where we're

1372
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,180
utilizing the new technology of LEDs to

1373
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,700
produce a very specific wavelength

1374
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:14,338
that's that's a very new newly available

1375
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:15,838
thing to humans there's a lot of other

1376
00:52:14,338 --> 00:52:17,639
new technologies that are coming onto

1377
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:19,679
the fore you know we're seeing a lot of

1378
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:21,838
agricultural robotics that won't be so

1379
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:23,818
applicable in the home Garden for many

1380
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,739
decades but there's really incredible

1381
00:52:23,818 --> 00:52:30,019
technology you know using machine

1382
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:34,139
learning and uh a visual AI to detect

1383
00:52:30,019 --> 00:52:36,300
for example weeds in a field and zap it

1384
00:52:34,139 --> 00:52:38,338
with a little laser just to just to kill

1385
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,920
it before it comes up or even zap it

1386
00:52:38,338 --> 00:52:43,318
with a little shoot of a little spray of

1387
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:46,500
herbicide instead of covering the whole

1388
00:52:43,318 --> 00:52:49,380
field cover that little one and one in

1389
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:53,099
itself you mentioned the enzymatic

1390
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:54,900
um uh Mammoth enzymatic um

1391
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:56,280
pesticide there are some there's some

1392
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:59,579
really interesting things coming forward

1393
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:01,680
with you know specifically choosing

1394
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:04,440
special enzymes and they are just

1395
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:06,299
incredibly powerful I mean imagine when

1396
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,700
we're talking about something like a um

1397
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,200
a predatory Mite or a ladybug what's it

1398
00:53:08,699 --> 00:53:12,118
doing you know it's hungry it goes in

1399
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:14,239
there it consumes it and it's the same

1400
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:16,200
with the enzymes but on a on a micro

1401
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:17,639
micromicroscopic scale

1402
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:21,299
um they're hungry little little

1403
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:23,159
molecules that just consume things so

1404
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:25,500
uh the problem with them is shelf life

1405
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:27,179
really and is how long they last on the

1406
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,679
surface of the leaf so as there's new

1407
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:31,019
developments there we're going to see

1408
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:33,480
some really impressive uh enzymatic

1409
00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:35,880
approaches things like just the tiniest

1410
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,679
amount of enzymes for a whole acre of

1411
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,079
Agriculture that's one that I'm very

1412
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:41,759
excited about but there there there's a

1413
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,720
lot on the horizon that's awesome yeah

1414
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,940
it sounds like it's going to make things

1415
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:47,818
a lot easier in the future for the

1416
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:49,679
gardener so cool well we could sit here

1417
00:53:47,818 --> 00:53:51,239
and talk on and on about more and more

1418
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:53,219
pests but we're running out of time here

1419
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:55,500
so I might have to save that for part

1420
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:57,239
two potentially wrapping things up how

1421
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,400
can the listeners find you and what do

1422
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:01,558
you have upcoming in the future

1423
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:04,260
yeah well I would say the best place is

1424
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:07,319
just to go to intralight.com and uh you

1425
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:09,180
can check out you know that really is uh

1426
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:11,519
the main thing that I'm working on is

1427
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:14,039
delivering a new Cutting Edge pesticidal

1428
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:15,599
technology to people at a really uh

1429
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:17,279
affordable level

1430
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,200
um to reduce their long-term crop

1431
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,960
protection expenses reduce the stress

1432
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:24,000
and reduce having to seek out pests and

1433
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,519
constantly apply things and I just want

1434
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,199
to give you another and I want to add to

1435
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:30,179
the bottom of the

1436
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:31,739
um IPM pyramid and just say here's

1437
00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:33,960
another passive treatment that you can

1438
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:35,699
use so that's the best place to find me

1439
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,099
what we have coming up is simply new

1440
00:54:35,699 --> 00:54:41,279
form factors because I say if you give

1441
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:43,140
me a a spider mite or a thrip in a box I

1442
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,000
can I can kill it anytime with our

1443
00:54:43,139 --> 00:54:45,900
technology it's very easy the question

1444
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,119
is

1445
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:50,160
plants are very complicated everyone's

1446
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:52,800
growing in a different way you know how

1447
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,779
do we deliver that light to the most uh

1448
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:57,000
the largest surface of the plant and it

1449
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:59,160
requires various form factors so we have

1450
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,199
coming up is new form factors for

1451
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:04,139
vertical farming for cloning shelves

1452
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:07,199
mobile form factors and things like this

1453
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:08,639
awesome so very exciting Simon this has

1454
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:10,139
been very insightful thank you so much

1455
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:11,879
