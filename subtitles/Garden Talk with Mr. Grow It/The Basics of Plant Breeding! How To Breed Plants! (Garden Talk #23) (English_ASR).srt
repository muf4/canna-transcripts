1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,439
coming up on garden talk and you want to

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,359
get

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,720
more purple then so first thing you'll

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,559
do is f2 you'll

5
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,000
take a sister and a brother you'll put

6
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,160
them together and that'll be your f2

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,519
and then f3 on the next sister brother

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,120
and that's fleel breeding all the way

9
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,599
down sister brother sister brother just

10
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,599
straight

11
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,359
but the word stable when it comes to

12
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,039
saying seeds are stable

13
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,480
means that they come out like a

14
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,359
monoculture that

15
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,640
99 of the traits that they display they

16
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,240
almost look like clones

17
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,480
all the progeny you can get them all

18
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,678
down to being all rude or alice after a

19
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,640
couple of generations of breeding or a

20
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:34,320
few generations

21
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,679
but to get it down to all them being

22
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,759
rude or alice you'll never get the

23
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,238
purple it'll always be recessive

24
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,079
against so you can take a male and

25
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:42,799
stress it out and run it long enough and

26
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,799
it will

27
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,839
throw female pistols and flowers and

28
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,599
seed itself

29
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,280
and all of your seeds that come from

30
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,840
that male will be

31
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,840
maleized

32
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,599

so great job it comes quick it comes

141
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,680
quick i don't even think about the

142
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,079
numbers most the time like the analytics

143
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,918
i know

144
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,120
others um even people on the team and

145
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,000
stuff like really nerd out about the

146
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,280
analytics i

147
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,720
sort of look past it and don't think

148
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,079
about it often then you hear the numbers

149
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,199
like that you're like well it does sound

150
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,639
like a lot

151
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,079
um but just really to me it's just like

152
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,759
you keep trudging right it's just it's

153
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,599
about the same work it's growing or it's

154
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,439
the same work you just keep going

155
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,879
um we've had years where like yeah

156
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,240
really active and then there's other

157
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,600
years where you know you take a slow

158
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,000
down you have other things going on in

159
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,479
life

160
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,199

163
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,000
been through little bits right we've had

164
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,519
channels deleted and youtube gave it

165
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,918
back

166
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,359

167
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,599

168
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,038

00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,680
of changes i think for everybody over

171
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,599
the years right you know even just with

172
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,160
life but

173
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
we're still making our way so still

174
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,479
still cruising through and still plan on

175
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,240
uh

176
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:17,839
keeping it up for the time being as long

177
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,000
as they allow us to keep

178
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,599
keep performing for sure for those that

179
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,959
don't know who you are can you tell us a

180
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,320
little bit about yourself and kind of

181
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,439
how you got into gardening

182
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:30,478
uh yeah so um yeah the kind of basic

183
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,478
little story is that um

184
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,680
when i was uh graduated high school

185
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,240
stuff like that i

186
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,240
joined the military um for different

187
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,199
reasons a couple of different reasons

188
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,240
but um ended up being in the military

189
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,240
for a couple years

190
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,400
got sick and resulted in kind of a lung

191
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,240
and bronchial issue for myself

192
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,159
um was peb what you call a physical

193
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,000
evaluation board so they

194
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,600
wouldn't allow me to stay because i was

195
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,560
going to take too long to recover and

196
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,039
they weren't even sure if i would

197
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,199
recover

198
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,599
all the way and it's pretty sick i spent

199
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,800
on and off a few months in the hospital

200
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,439
at a time in full

201
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,319
icu very similar to some of the viral

202
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,319
issues that you see

203
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,520
people going through at the time i had

204
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,919
um gotten something

205
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,959
uh very similar in the sense of like

206
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,639
that resulted in

207
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,318
my body than producing pneumonia

208
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,038
symptoms and all of that

209
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,319
so couldn't kick the virus that it was

210
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:21,759
at that time

211
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,199
got pneumonia over and over again so

212
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,800
they kept relapsing with it and it

213
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,038
damaged and scarred my lungs and my

214
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,879
bronchials so i got bronchitis and

215
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,318
lung scarring from it and was pretty

216
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,680
down about it and military was like

217
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,759
you're not gonna be

218
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,439
coming back right now like you're done

219
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,479
and i'd gone all the way down to

220
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,519
like 140 pounds at one point and that

221
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,478
was going from

222
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,758
like 240 pounds of you know having some

223
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:45,599
muscle on

224
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,520
so that like in a six month period just

225
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,919
way down then couldn't get weight back

226
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:53,439
up so when i got out of military

227
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,560
is about 180 pounds um and i'm 6'8 so

228
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,120
you know my

229
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,959
average good weight is 205 to 220 at

230
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,639
least just to be doing pretty good

231
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,959
kind of slip below that and a little too

232
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,160
thin so i still had some work to get

233
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,399
going

234
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,560
and they retired me and i didn't know

235
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:12,638
what to do i was on a bunch of steroids

236
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,879
um in 2001 and

237
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,079
just really feeling down i had been an

238
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,959
athlete my whole life

239
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,318
and wasn't wasn't sure what the next

240
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,799
step was right um

241
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,080
there were things like uh you know

242
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,079
medicinal

243
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,758
herb uh that you know pretty popular in

244
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,199
the culture around cali and everything

245
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,240
like that

246
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,240
derivative of hemp and in that

247
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,759
fashion it was offered to me during the

248
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,840
time to think about it

249
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,680
but i had always been an athlete and so

250
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,598
i'd always avoided it friends and people

251
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,199
participated um you know at a party here

252
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:46,000
and there i had had a beer

253
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,199
you know a few hops and uh passed around

254
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,720
some of that medicinal

255
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,639
but it never really affected me much i

256
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,080
was like oh it wasn't a big deal so i

257
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,639
never used it never really thought about

258
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,918
it

259
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,960
and i had seen some friends that of

260
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:56,079
course like you get in that kind of

261
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,239
culture some people

262
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,159
can abuse things really easily and so

263
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,519
that was always in my mindset

264
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,080
but got a military on a bunch of

265
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,680
steroids doctors didn't know what to do

266
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,120
and a friend of mine joked about it a

267
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,038
little peter tosh

268
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,639
bob marley right you know ha ha ha

269
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,478
here's uh asthma

270
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,560
and i was like oh i'll give it a shot

271
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,959
and so friend brought some over

272
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,439
and um tried it and couldn't believe how

273
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:22,239
incredibly just immediately

274
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,199
better i felt um even for my lungs

275
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,319
things like that even though i'd

276
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,280
scarring you know you would think that

277
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,439
it would be a

278
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,359
like a no-no especially to consume a

279
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,560
product um by like you know inhaling and

280
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,080
burning it

281
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,440
but ended up changing my life around

282
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,000
about the viewpoint of it

283
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,519
and so at that time period it was really

284
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,080
important especially for me to make sure

285
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,278
that i had

286
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,480
clean um product

287
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,480
because a lot of people especially in

288
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,600
unregulated markets can use right you

289
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,039
know you're fighting a lot of weird pest

290
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,399
issues things like that so people will

291
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,838
use products that

292
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,759
are outside of agriculture because

293
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,000
there's no regulation so it was really

294
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,919
important to me at the beginning

295
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,919
to be able to produce my own product i

296
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,360
learned that very quickly so

297
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,278
the one thing about that time period was

298
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,039
that it was harder to get your medical

299
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:08,159
and everything in cali at the time in 96

300
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,599
they had to open it up but 2001 2002

301
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,360
still really difficult had to go to like

302
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,480
one specific specialty doctor you had to

303
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,680
go through a bunch of stuff bring all

304
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,480
your records

305
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,719
multiple interviews ended up getting a

306
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,200
card and ended up being able to also

307
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,560
produce

308
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,800
and cali law you could produce for

309
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,399
yourself as well so

310
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,479
along with that i started producing for

311
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,519
myself pretty lightly for a couple of

312
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,440
years

313
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,560
and then it just kind of grew from that

314
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,640
point on but

315
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,719
and i ended up falling in love with us

316
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,360
not only the plant itself but plants in

317
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,639
general

318
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,560
agriculture and all kinds of

319
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,319
medicinal plants that do come along with

320
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,719
these concepts once you break your mind

321
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,560
free

322
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,959
of like a stigma of something you've

323
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,879
been told then it makes you realize like

324
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,278
well hey if we were told this about this

325
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:54,240
stuff then what other things out there

326
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,838
are there misconceptions for and so that

327
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,159
sorted me on a path

328
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,440
definitely more based in agriculture at

329
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,600
a large part of my life

330
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,880
gotcha and then you had mentioned before

331
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,040
we started

332
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,039
filming is that you've been breeding for

333
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,199
over 15 years now is that right

334
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,039
uh yeah so the first few years for sure

335
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,200
it was just for myself

336
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,319
i would just produce product or flowers

337
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,120
and things like that

338
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,440
to be able to make different products

339
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,679
and

340
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,040
try different avenues too you know

341
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,399
thinking about it um because there are

342
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,799
different ways to consume the products

343
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,000
or

344
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,599
make different products for it and

345
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,919
found you know what worked for me what i

346
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,240
liked and then

347
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,679
slowly though more friends because

348
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,720
you're doing a good job

349
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:39,599
of producing product um clean product

350
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,160
then more people would like some of it

351
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
and so

352
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,199
i just ended up sort of growing that

353
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,800
more and more and because

354
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,240
i did have the permits and everything

355
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,519
available or right i started with my

356
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,959
card and then kind of worked my way

357
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,278
through the system to see like hey

358
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,199
in my county in my area what can we do

359
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,720
can you bring that up more production

360
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,320
had some friends thought about it i had

361
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,800
really gotten into the online community

362
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,480
so

363
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,078
um people that know like back from the

364
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,600
overgrown days that's where i initially

365
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:04,399
started doing seed trading

366
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,360
so i started because i saw that going on

367
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,839
i thought well you know if you're a

368
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,600
farmer

369
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,040
like not only you can grow something but

370
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,360
you also want to breed it you also want

371
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:11,360
to

372
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,039
try participating in those future

373
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,800
generations

374
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,879
a lot with like the medicinal plant that

375
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,879
we use you can

376
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,320
propagate these plants through cloning

377
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,679
and so that's super popular

378
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,440
and it was super popular in our

379
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,159
community and um

380
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,760
in cali and in that industry as we'd

381
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,000
call it

382
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,919
but i still like you know you had to to

383
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
even get different kinds of phenotypes

384
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,439
different kinds of unique clones

385
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,039
you could have things that people had

386
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,399
found but you could also make your own

387
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,519
and so that's what started me on the

388
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,078
journey and i started

389
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,519
small by just using what they call

390
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,319
feminized breeding where

391
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,919
you take a plant and you hermaphrodite

392
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,879
it and then you'll use pollen against

393
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,519
another

394
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,958
particular strain style and then you'll

395
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,320
get something unique out of those

396
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:58,000
progeny

397
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:01,519
or offspring so that was my original

398
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,278
um sort of tiptoe in from maybe 2002

399
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,879
to 2006 taking things breeding them

400
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:08,399
finding clones and then releasing those

401
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,958
clones into the market

402
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,720
and slowly running sort of clone market

403
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:15,439
business as well

404
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,759
and it wasn't really for like producing

405
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,279
seeds that didn't come until later

406
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:20,958
by being able to share seeds with other

407
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,639
people maybe with friends and of course

408
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,319
seed trading online that's where

409
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,600
we were all doing it and there was

410
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,079
nothing wrong with it it was still it's

411
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,759
just

412
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,199
hemp seed right still a derivative same

413
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,399
species stuff so

414
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,040
there um being no cannabinoids things

415
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,078
like that

416
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:38,879
um that had regulation towards them um

417
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,239
especially for like us in the u.s then

418
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,919
that was our way that we could get

419
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,278
around that without having like live

420
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,599
plants or

421
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,200
live products and things even though in

422
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,440
our areas it was

423
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,959
regulated in in legal at least on a

424
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,279
state or county levels

425
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,799
okay so let's get into let's start with

426
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,120
some of the basic

427
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,559
terminology you know starting with what

428
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,078
exactly is breeding

429
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,518
so when it comes to breeding there's um

430
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,439
you're basically making offspring right

431
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,839
in nature we've got that

432
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,639
with animals and with plants with

433
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,760
animals

434
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,839
it can be a little bit different

435
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,200
obviously a little bit more complicated

436
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:18,240
with plants it's going to be i generally

437
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,240
call it a little simpler

438
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,079
you could argue theoretically a few

439
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,320
different um vantage and viewpoints for

440
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:27,199
it depending especially the species but

441
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,639
overall it's pretty much simpler in the

442
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,079
sense that

443
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,959
for plants you have monoisius and

444
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,319
dioecious audacious diocese i kind of

445
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,679
get the some people say it's tomato

446
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,040
tomatoes sometimes

447
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:44,078
um but these are the difference between

448
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:46,240
plants that have either the

449
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,159
both sex organs on themselves so

450
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,759
technically they can self

451
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,198
pollinate themselves although they

452
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,120
generally

453
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,439
will pollinate at different times you

454
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,399
take like maize corn

455
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,240
that is it tries to have its male parts

456
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,000
and pollen come at a different time than

457
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,799
its female parts on its particular

458
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,720
plant so another corn or maize will be

459
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,799
flowering its female parts at a time

460
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,560
which one near it will be flowering male

461
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,078
parts so it tries not to pollinate

462
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,838
itself so much

463
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,278
and then send it off to other things

464
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,480
although technically can pollinate but

465
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,600
they have both

466
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,399
organs and then dioecious right you're

467
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,199
going to have

468
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:27,519
um two different male and female plants

469
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,439
now some people get that confused with

470
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,198
like hemp because hemp can show those

471
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,600
traits

472
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,799
but actually genetically there's it's a

473
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,639
little bit of a difference it would be

474
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,799
considered a diocese plant so

475
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,919
it has both males and females which was

476
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:41,278
something really interesting for me to

477
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,240
learn at the time because when i first

478
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:44,078
learned about it

479
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,000
i actually thought all plants and

480
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,399
especially flowers and things of those

481
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,919
species that are near there

482
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,600
um like on the taxonomy when it comes to

483
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,719
botany were

484
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,199
they all were males and or

485
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,320
male female parts to be on one plant so

486
00:14:57,198 --> 00:14:59,439
it was interesting to me and that was

487
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,160
kind of like the joke at the beginning

488
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,000
like oh

489
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:05,120
it's an alien plant because you know

490
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,958
there's true like males and true females

491
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,480
until i learned more about agriculture

492
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,239
and botany and then it turned out like

493
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,240
oh no you do find this around

494
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,600
quite a lot so it's just you get two

495
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,240
separations

496
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,920
for that for us then we have two

497
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,560
different sets we're going for

498
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,838
females and males and that's the

499
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,919
baseline of

500
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,279
breeding which we call true breeding or

501
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:30,159
many people refer to as regular

502
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,360
in our particular industry or community

503
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,439
with our plants

504
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,278
and then getting into i think it's

505
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,440
appropriate to talk about genotype

506
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,120
and phenotype now this is something that

507
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,440
i had briefly talked about

508
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,879
in a recent uh past podcast with

509
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,839
northwest j we talked about phenol

510
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:45,278
hunting

511
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,480
uh we described what it is there but i

512
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,320
think it's appropriate to talk about it

513
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,839
here as well in this episode ken

514
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,160
can you break down genotype and

515
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,480
phenotype for us phenos are going to be

516
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,000
what your progeny persists on so you'll

517
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,879
have different phenotypic

518
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,179
expressions per traits the genotype

519
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,600
itself is the larger

520
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:05,120
[Music]

521
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,159
genomics of a plant so and phenotypes

522
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,480
are kind of

523
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,919
we throw it around a lot i think in like

524
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,959
oh this is the phenotype

525
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,559
of the plant but what you're really

526
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,039
talking about when you get a progeny and

527
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,198
it's

528
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,439
it's a phenotype of it meaning it's

529
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,838
showing a phenotypical trait

530
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,880
so let's say uh color purple right you

531
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,320
know even though something like color

532
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,679
purple comes from really stress

533
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,959
and it comes from mutations for that um

534
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,159
but let's say you're just going for

535
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,159
color and you want something so you get

536
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,000
a progeny that has something

537
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:33,519
offspring that has purple in it you

538
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,720
would call it a purple phenotype but

539
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,720
it's really just displaying that

540
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,639
particular trait it's not the whole

541
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,480
thing itself it's actually only just the

542
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,278
miniature traits versus the genotype

543
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,519
which is

544
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,879
the whole thing in general for that

545
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,519
species if that makes sense

546
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,639
yep that makes sense and so kind of

547
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,639
taking a step back

548
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,639
just to kind of make things basic for

549
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,639
the beginners for introduction

550
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,560
male plants are going to produce the

551
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,159
pollen sex and they're going to release

552
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:59,758
the pollen sacs will open and release

553
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,639
pollen females

554
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,720
grow pistils and receive the pollen

555
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,558
through that ultimately forming a seed

556
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,880
within the plant's buds now there are

557
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:12,160
different generations

558
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,839
f1 f2 f3 etc etc

559
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,720
what is an f1 so yeah that nomenclature

560
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,000
is when you take

561
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,519
two different kids and you or two

562
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,038
different things in a species and put it

563
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,639
together so it can still breed right

564
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,400
like it's still the same

565
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,600
technical species i mean it gets kind of

566
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,038
it gets a little different because you

567
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,918
talk about like things like animals are

568
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:32,240
easy to

569
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,640
show like lions and tigers are obviously

570
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,599
different but they're close enough

571
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,080
that they can breed together and then

572
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,599
they're

573
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:40,720
at the same time kind of far enough away

574
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,519
from each other that when you breed them

575
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,519
together you get

576
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,759
weird things going on right everything

577
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,319
from sterility to gigantism and all

578
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,200
kinds of

579
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,639
uh funky stuff so they've gotten away

580
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,279
pretty far away but they're not super

581
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,559
close

582
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,879
where if you're talking about a species

583
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,200
like for us where we're using our plants

584
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,240
um

585
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,759
we're so close that we can move into

586
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,880
different

587
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,319
the same downward spiral is is really

588
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,600
within the same thing so like humans

589
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,439
like we're all

590
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,038
so similar that you can just mix this

591
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,038
like our idea that

592
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:12,160
hair is a certain way or skin or

593
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:14,240
different things

594
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,160
um they're really similar they're small

595
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,960
little changes to us they look like they

596
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,960
might be

597
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,960
um a wide variety of stuff but really

598
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,840
genetically we are so similar

599
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,200
that um these traits are just well

600
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,599
within the same species

601
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,120
so that's where like f1s and things i'm

602
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,599
talking about just hybridization because

603
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,558
all

604
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,119
all of our plants are hybridized itself

605
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:34,720
and so

606
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,959
you can take one that's purple and one

607
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,038
that's green and put them together

608
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,120
and then that'll be your f1 on that and

609
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:43,679
then your f2s your f3s

610
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,879
traits down these are fallible breeding

611
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,120
um generally what you're going to do is

612
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,120
an offspring and progeny you'll take

613
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,879
like you'll have two parents and then if

614
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:52,239
you f1 they're going to be two separate

615
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,360
parents right from two different zones

616
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,919
maybe they're on two different sides of

617
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,519
the valley

618
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,480
okay they've been developing far enough

619
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,639
away from each other but they're like

620
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,880
two different tribes

621
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,799
north side and south side so that is the

622
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,360
f1 north and south side together

623
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:05,839
then their progeny their offspring if

624
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,959
you take

625
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,879
a brother and a sister and you breed

626
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,480
them together because north side and

627
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,360
south side had two different traits

628
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,319
um you know purple and green then and

629
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,240
you want to get

630
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:19,599
more purple then so first thing you'll

631
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,679
do is f2 you'll

632
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:23,199
take a sister and a brother you'll put

633
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,000
them together and that'll be your f2 and

634
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,600
then f3

635
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,200
on the next sister brother and that's

636
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,119
fleel breeding all the way down sister

637
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,798
brother sister brother just straight

638
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,798
eventually you can back yourself into

639
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,240
corners um generally with like hemp and

640
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:37,519
stuff it's pretty well known you get

641
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,079
like f16 somewhere f12 to f16

642
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,639
and generally you'll get to sterility

643
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,119
and

644
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,360
probably some funky genetic traits weird

645
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:48,798
growth patterns all kinds of stuff

646
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,839
in between there so you can only go so

647
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,639
far without

648
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,439
f1 again meaning taking something out of

649
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,280
that lineup

650
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,880
and resetting it back to something a

651
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,678
little bit different so that's where you

652
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,400
get those

653
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,440
back crosses would be back crossing to

654
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,880
if we move into that

655
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,720
right which is really popular and that's

656
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,559
where it's much quicker to get to a

657
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,319
trait so you can easily back cross by

658
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:10,079
meaning you did an f1

659
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,240
and then you got something purple and

660
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,960
the north original

661
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,720
parent lineage was also purple so you

662
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,400
take a purple child and you back cross

663
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,720
that to the purple parent

664
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,600
and then you'll take a purple grand kid

665
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,279
and

666
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:26,158
change that back to the original parent

667
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,599
again so then you get down to like bx4

668
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,360
where you're like four generations down

669
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,639
but you still keep going back

670
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,759
up to your original parent which is your

671
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,960
your zero

672
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,558
or your p p ones so

673
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,558
that's where you get into like bat

674
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,678
crossing and then you get into

675
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:45,359
self crossing which is because with like

676
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,840
hemp for example even though

677
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,599
it has males and females it has we have

678
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,199
been able to breed it and it was showing

679
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,759
it in nature and naturally

680
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,558
where it will throw both male and female

681
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,200
parts

682
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,759
unfortunately the or this happens with

683
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,558
both

684
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,759
plants styles even monoissues or diocese

685
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,879
that when you self

686
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:06,400
the pollen from itself adds in extra

687
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,039
chromosomes so that's where you get like

688
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,240
x

689
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:12,480
uh or y xx things like that

690
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,880
so then when you get your future progeny

691
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,079
they're not what we call true breed

692
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,520
where they'll just have x y and xx

693
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,119
which is why it can get a little

694
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,639
confusing when people go to test for sex

695
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,158
with the sex testing because the sex

696
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,200
tests

697
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,039
check for why so you could say like oh

698
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,880
this is a y it's a male but it might

699
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:34,240
actually be a y

700
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,120
x x right or x x y so you're catching

701
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,440
the y

702
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,879
thinking it's male but really it's going

703
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,679
to if you grew it out it would look

704
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,280
female if you didn't give it any stress

705
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,720
it wouldn't show any of its uh like

706
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,839
hermaphroditic traits it wouldn't

707
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,600
it wouldn't show its selfing traits

708
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,678
so that's just something to think about

709
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,079
that chromosomes and those things aren't

710
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,400
all

711
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:56,399
equal in the way um that becomes like

712
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,440
very advanced right concepts and and

713
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,159
things get a little so without

714
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,960
digressing

715
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,840
into um weird theoretical or other

716
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,200
concepts

717
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:08,558
just keeping it simple um getting into

718
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,038
cell thing s1 s2 can

719
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,480
be really viable in a lot of situations

720
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,480
and help hybridize so it's another

721
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,120
technique that you can use in speed

722
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,159
against valial crossing which always

723
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:20,399
takes much longer

724
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,280
to pull the traits out especially when

725
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,960
two things are

726
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,440
vastly different so if you take

727
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,079
something like a plant that was from

728
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,000
equatorial

729
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,918
zone you know in colombia and then you

730
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,079
want to go breed that against something

731
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,600
that was natural in nature i'm very

732
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,960
close in the species but it was over in

733
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,279
northern europe

734
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,159
then it's going to be far more

735
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,079
hybridized

736
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,080
right your progeny are going to be way

737
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,918
more varied where if you take something

738
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:45,279
from equatorial columbia

739
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,600
and then you take something that was

740
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,720
over in peru and you put those together

741
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,158
they're going to be much closer you're

742
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,120
still going to call them an f1

743
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,400
when you breed them together but it

744
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,239
doesn't necessarily

745
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,759
mean that they're not going to be so

746
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,519
similar because maybe they had had some

747
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:00,798
crossing back and forth between the days

748
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,200
earlier

749
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:06,000
um they can be much more stable in a

750
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,159
sense as far as like a monoculture crop

751
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,440
um but you'll still call them f1s and f2

752
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,039
so it's something to think about when

753
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,320
people hear like oh this is an f1 i want

754
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:13,839
to stay away from those or

755
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,599
this is an f2 well something that's so

756
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:17,199
hybridized nowadays especially in our

757
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:18,639
industry and community

758
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,480
most of the time we've hybridized

759
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,799
everything so much so when we f1 things

760
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,079
they're still so many traits that are

761
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,000
similar that they're going to work well

762
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:26,798
together and you you may not see as much

763
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,839
variety

764
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:29,918
and then you just have to get to know

765
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:33,519
your breeds but that's why

766
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,240
you know 30 70s 80s there was a lot more

767
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:36,558
varied

768
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,919
production but over the years of course

769
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:38,240
we're all just interacting with each

770
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,600
other

771
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,278
and get passing around plants and

772
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,918
genetics that we've really

773
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,720
come to a place where we've gotten away

774
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,080
from a lot of those

775
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,839
extreme you don't find those as much

776
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,359
anymore because the production has moved

777
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:53,359
itself all around the world

778
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,759
gotcha and for the record i am not a

779
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:59,359
breeder i just want to make that clear

780
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:01,599
i did create a cross i did uh brisker og

781
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:04,000
cross with pakistan valley then you are

782
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,079
a breeder

783
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,278
learning so much from this conversation

784
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,278
here uh you know

785
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,278
the short 20 minutes that we've already

786
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:13,359
been recording i've learned so much so i

787
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:15,200
don't consider myself a breeder at all

788
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:18,000
or if you consider me a breeder i'm a

789
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,519
breeder with barely any experience

790
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,038
yeah experience levels but same with

791
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:22,319
myself and i'm sure that somewhere in

792
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,240
here somebody who has

793
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,079
um you know a particular level of

794
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,880
education will catch me on saying things

795
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:28,399
that uh

796
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,240
right like you know you're always gonna

797
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,278
do that even myself like i'm pretty well

798
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,919
up with it i can

799
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:36,000
handle it with the best um i have

800
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,559
friends who are phd

801
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,079
right like they straight up i can hang

802
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,359
with them and know a lot of concepts but

803
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,480
at the same time i don't always get the

804
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,158
terms and everything right and i think

805
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,440
that's important to note even for

806
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,278
someone like you as you're getting into

807
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,038
it don't get hung up on it if you kind

808
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,960
of messed up on a term or something

809
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,720
or even a concept as long as you have

810
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,200
the baseline of it like that's a great

811
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,558
beginning

812
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,880
you just keep working on it you learn

813
00:24:54,558 --> 00:25:00,000
from new people but even i myself

814
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,400
um learn all the time so uh

815
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,159
but you're on that path and it is well

816
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,919
to call yourself if you started breeding

817
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,600
then you're a breeder like that's

818
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,960
to me that's the the same place you're

819
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:10,639
participating in something that most

820
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,400
people don't participate when it comes

821
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,080
to plants and

822
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,679
farming just in general that's a really

823
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,399
good point for sure

824
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,038
okay let's hop into the selection

825
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,360
process

826
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:22,720
so uh you know oftentimes breeders

827
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,519
they're gonna select

828
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,400
certain males or females we'll start

829
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,639
with males

830
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,519
they look at certain characteristics in

831
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,440
the plant

832
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,119
things that they're looking for that

833
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,440
they want to breed

834
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,278
within that cultivar so talking about

835
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,278
the male selection process

836
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:41,200
what are some characteristics that you

837
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:42,798
look for when you're selecting males

838
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,558
yeah when it comes to these kinds of

839
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,879
things i've always erred so it kind of

840
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:49,119
depends on on where

841
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,000
whether you know your your particular

842
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,158
strains or not

843
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,519
all right um if you're in one species of

844
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,880
a plant

845
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:59,278
once you know your strains more you can

846
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,159
make a variety of decisions based on

847
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:02,079
that but

848
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,400
always starting really simply like just

849
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:07,038
in a basic level you want to get into it

850
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,400
my i always lean into recommending that

851
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:11,919
you go for help

852
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:15,120
go for the health of the males

853
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,320
and you don't worry about um trying to

854
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,558
get into

855
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,319
the nitty-gritty of figuring out what

856
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:21,839
traits they're gonna pass on

857
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:23,359
um you're gonna be able to tell that

858
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,480
especially like in our

859
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:28,158
field um with the females it's the more

860
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,240
prized possession it's what people are

861
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,000
going for so you concentrate more on

862
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,159
what the females are to be displaying

863
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,839
and not what the males are displaying

864
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,880
because what you're going to get into

865
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:41,759
is dominant and recessive traits

866
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,360
so you could pick a male for example

867
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,400
that is showing purple

868
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:49,199
but when you breed it with a female

869
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,519
that has purple green um and then all

870
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,840
the progeny just turn out green

871
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:54,720
that is because there is a dominant

872
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:58,798
trait

873
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,720
right that is going to grasp on

874
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:03,038
and be it comes in ones and twos or

875
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,839
zeros and ones and that dominant trait

876
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,359
is going to overtake the recessive trait

877
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:08,879
it's just the way it works so you'll run

878
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,479
into that all the time with breeding so

879
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,960
that is why i say at the beginning

880
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,759
you worry about health of the plants

881
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,640
things like that

882
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:18,960
strength and stay away from worrying

883
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,559
about the traits themselves as much when

884
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,120
it comes to the males the females are

885
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,639
much easier to identify the traits

886
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,239
and then when you breed with them you'll

887
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,038
be able to then try keep picking

888
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,440
those females that display those traits

889
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:30,480
then

890
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,720
of course you can start doing with the

891
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,399
males themselves colors

892
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,079
um you know for hemp and things like

893
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,798
that when it comes to like trichomes

894
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:40,720
and stuff um and production then that

895
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:42,000
will lend itself over and it will if you

896
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,640
start picking

897
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,839
purple males that are real sticky right

898
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,520
and you want stickier

899
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:48,720
flowers on your females it's going to

900
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,119
lend itself over and you're going to

901
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
find

902
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:52,398
more dominant traits for it but i always

903
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,480
say get to know your plants first before

904
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:56,879
worrying about the specific traits

905
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,319
because of those dominant recessive

906
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,120
genes are going to be more powerful and

907
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:00,480
you're going to find

908
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,839
the visualization of being able to

909
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,120
choose that and understanding your

910
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:05,599
plants under females

911
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:06,719
much quicker and easier males are a

912
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:08,240
little harder to kind of

913
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,079
wrap your brain you don't see them a lot

914
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,640
you don't deal with them a lot

915
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,398
and they will display different traits

916
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,399
depending on what

917
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,079
strain line they come down and i know

918
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,398
that from experience that

919
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:21,678
certain strain lines i'm not worried

920
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,599
about if a male is tall

921
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,120
it's it's always a recessive trait with

922
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,839
the particular females i'm running so

923
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:27,359
i'm always

924
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:28,639
i don't care if he gets super lanky it

925
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,158
doesn't really bother me that much i

926
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,720
mean i don't want it extremely lanky but

927
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,799
it does

928
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,798
i will pick a linkier male that is

929
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:37,038
purple over

930
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,319
um a male that like oh i don't want it

931
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:39,679
getting too lanky so

932
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,558
i'll get it a little bit more green

933
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,159
because i just don't want to keep the

934
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:44,720
height down so you have to figure that

935
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,520
out that's kind of that artistry

936
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,960
experience that comes in uh play and

937
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,679
that's the hard part about time

938
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,159
then time comes into play and experience

939
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,559
so

940
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,440
shooting for males that are healthy

941
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:57,119
strong

942
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,399
that's the best way to go at first

943
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,639
because that will always bring up the

944
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,719
health and vigor of all of your strains

945
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,159
and all the progeny from that point on

946
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,240
even with females because we hybridize

947
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,320
stuff so much and so many people

948
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,798
in the industry end up getting seeds

949
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:13,439
from stressed out situations

950
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:13,839
things didn't go just perfect maybe

951
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,840
you're

952
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:16,959
breeding against clones that have been

953
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,720
around a long time

954
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,319
and they have slowly had epigenetic

955
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,360
drift as we call it

956
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:25,038
so epigenetic wise they've been

957
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:26,798
exposed to different environments and

958
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,319
different stressors and that has changed

959
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,319
their genetics so just like the twin

960
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:31,038
even with humans you take two twins and

961
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:32,319
one of them

962
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:34,240
grows up well super healthy and the

963
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:36,000
other one is malnourished growing up

964
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,919
you're gonna get different you're gonna

965
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,759
get that particular exact

966
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,759
clone in a sense right that identical

967
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:44,640
twin to

968
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:46,640
um one be displaying different traits

969
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,399
even later on in their life they could

970
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,159
have displayed either trait right

971
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:52,239
of being a little hunched back or being

972
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,080
standing up straight for example

973
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,278
but due to those stressors so when it

974
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:58,000
comes to clones

975
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:59,519
a lot of times and even seed batches as

976
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,079
people are doing

977
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:03,918
we sort of end up defaulting down into

978
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,918
things not being as healthy

979
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,679
and um one of the easiest ways to bring

980
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,720
up the health of stuff is just the pick

981
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,120
for

982
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,480
healthier plants in the beginning okay

983
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:14,000
that makes sense so if that kind of

984
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,519
makes sense in that real i just say

985
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,398
start start start soft

986
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,200
start simple gotcha now when i first

987
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:22,158
grow the male

988
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,759
i was really surprised by not only how

989
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,840
fast those pollen stacks

990
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,359
grew but how fast they opened up you

991
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:29,119
know so i think it was like around day

992
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,038
20 or something upon sacks were opened

993
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:34,959
up and pollen was going everywhere

994
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:37,759
um around what day of flower

995
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,480
do you feel it's best to kind of harvest

996
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:40,558
pollen or

997
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,319
collect pollen from males in order to

998
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:43,440
kind of maximize the amount of pollen

999
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:45,519
you're getting

1000
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,038
because some people there you know let

1001
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,879
me back up a second so some people are

1002
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:49,200
actually collecting the pollen storing

1003
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,200
it

1004
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,558
and using it later and then there's some

1005
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,519
people who are just putting a male in

1006
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:55,200
with a female

1007
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,440
and shaking it so as far as like people

1008
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,278
who are collecting it what day of flower

1009
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,600
was best do you think to kind of harvest

1010
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:03,519
that pollen in my experience there's no

1011
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:05,519
difference between pollen that is just

1012
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,079
being released and pollen that's um

1013
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,599
on a male that's been opening pollen up

1014
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:11,359
for a couple of weeks

1015
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:12,959
the viability and strength of that

1016
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:13,359
pollen the genetics that they're passing

1017
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,360
on

1018
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:16,639
is exactly the same they're just doing

1019
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,000
it at different rates you know they're

1020
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,519
they're growing up they're the first

1021
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,679
statements and are coming out they're

1022
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,798
starting to drop pollen for the males

1023
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,080
um the wind i mean you know with like

1024
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:27,359
hemp for example like you know you don't

1025
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:28,639
even need a pollinator like these or

1026
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,158
anything like that right you just you

1027
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,440
know the wind will just take care of it

1028
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,799
um so if you're in a chamber or

1029
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,000
something

1030
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:37,278
that'll just all on its own um

1031
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,038
get off an environment and the females

1032
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:40,079
will grab it if you're collecting

1033
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:40,798
then you don't have to worry about it

1034
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:42,319
you can just do it right at the

1035
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,359
beginning get enough pollen and you can

1036
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,639
nuke that male and you don't have to

1037
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,359
keep it around you don't have to waste

1038
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,120
time on it

1039
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:48,798
or anything like that so if you're just

1040
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:51,119
doing pollen collection

1041
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:52,558
then yeah collect as much as you need

1042
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,158
right at the beginning and then you can

1043
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:58,960
move on it will not

1044
00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:00,799
change the strength or any of the traits

1045
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,319
by letting the males go longer they're

1046
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:04,158
just going to keep producing pollen to

1047
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:05,359
get more females because

1048
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,960
plants grow at different rates

1049
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:08,319
especially in nature so the plants know

1050
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,759
that like hey you know they drop males

1051
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,519
drop pollen from

1052
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:12,879
you know they start opening up every two

1053
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,640
or three weeks right you know usually by

1054
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,240
week three males are totally blooming

1055
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,000
and then they're gonna bloom until week

1056
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,919
five or six and then they're just

1057
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,398
they'll almost die off themselves like

1058
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,640
after they've spent males are just like

1059
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:26,319
and then they're down you won't even see

1060
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,519
them last which is why we usually say

1061
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,000
even if you're doing chambers or

1062
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,519
something you can cut off your males

1063
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,720
after week five or week six

1064
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,919
and not even worry about it and then

1065
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
once the males are cut out of the

1066
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,080
situation

1067
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,600
then the females will put a lot more

1068
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,480
production and okay i'm not getting any

1069
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,759
more male pollen

1070
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,440
like now i'm really going to put that

1071
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:42,640
production into the seeds and the

1072
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,320
embryos

1073
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,080
okay and then as far as like collecting

1074
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:47,678
the collecting process i've done a

1075
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,000
couple different ways i mean i've put a

1076
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,679
bag over the actual branch

1077
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,159
and shook it so the palm gets collected

1078
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,000
in a bag you know cutting it off

1079
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,519
you know bashing it down onto like tin

1080
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,159
foil and then scraping it up is another

1081
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,240
way

1082
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,080
i'm using one of those like trim trays

1083
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,519
you know that has a screen on it bashing

1084
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:04,720
it down there so all the pollen comes

1085
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,640
down below i found that

1086
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,000
to be kind of the best way what

1087
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,320
techniques do you use

1088
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,759
to collect pollen yeah so your biggest

1089
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:14,558
thing for collecting pollen because

1090
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,599
pollen is gonna go inert really quickly

1091
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:17,519
if it dries up

1092
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:19,599
um and that's one thing to note also

1093
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,359
with males just as like a side tangent

1094
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:23,278
which is like if you have a male

1095
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,719
um and it dries up or the pollen dries

1096
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:27,679
up it's going to go inert within

1097
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,798
like 72 hours if it dries it'll be dead

1098
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,919
it won't matter you can see the little

1099
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,359
yellow pollen around

1100
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,120
you know on the edges but if it's dried

1101
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:35,119
up and gone it's gone

1102
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:36,719
and it won't be pollinating anything

1103
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:38,398
else anymore so you want to

1104
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,079
throw that into a cool environment right

1105
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:41,918
um i'm guessing you

1106
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:43,359
you either did fridge or freeze um the

1107
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,679
pollen yeah i put it in the fridge and i

1108
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,798
was

1109
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,880
another question i was going to ask you

1110
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:48,240
is the best way to store pollen yeah so

1111
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,360
um cooling it down and keeping the

1112
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,558
moisture level it's basically what's

1113
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:52,000
going on with the fridge and cooling it

1114
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:55,278
then you'll you'll get

1115
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,599
six months or so out of it um often um

1116
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:59,119
getting into longer period freezing then

1117
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:02,319
you need to freeze it

1118
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:04,000
and then um normal fridges work okay

1119
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:06,079
you know you're lucky to get a year year

1120
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,679
and a half out of that pollen um

1121
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:09,279
you'll need to get into like minus 80

1122
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,200
environments um

1123
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,800
to be able to store pollen for longer

1124
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,039
periods of time and then of course

1125
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,480
any time you freeze it because we all

1126
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:18,559
know this water expands

1127
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,000
i'm just like a human being or you know

1128
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:22,320
you put ice you put water

1129
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,679
in a glass inside your freezer dice

1130
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,159
expands breaks the glass

1131
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,000
same things happen with cells so when

1132
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,480
you go to dethaw stuff

1133
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,480
if it wasn't frozen quickly enough it

1134
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,559
can actually like the expansion

1135
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,320
will will happen and when you go to d

1136
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:37,039
thought it will create more problems

1137
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,559
with moisture

1138
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:41,918
and damage the pollen itself so it's the

1139
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,398
d thought process that ends up being

1140
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,398
hard

1141
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:45,519
which is why yeah if you want to be able

1142
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:47,039
to kind of move into a

1143
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:48,000
similar round like on the next round you

1144
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:49,119
know you're going to use that pollen on

1145
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,519
the next round but you just want to save

1146
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,440
it for

1147
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,838
a couple months then just throwing it in

1148
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,960
the fridge is generally a better idea

1149
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,119
one of the things you want to do for

1150
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,838
oxygen is oxidization

1151
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,160
or oxidization and everything is that

1152
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:05,199
you want to get the air out as much air

1153
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:07,039
and getting out enough particles so

1154
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,480
like you're saying putting it over a

1155
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,000
screen and just getting the pollen

1156
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,079
itself and keeping out a lot of the

1157
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
larger

1158
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,680
cell structure the stamens and you know

1159
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
leaf matter and things like that

1160
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:19,519
is going to help in that storage process

1161
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,440
without inviting any

1162
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:22,880
other because there's moles and fungi

1163
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,079
and everything like that floating around

1164
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,119
bacteria floating around and those

1165
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,760
bacteria and everything and

1166
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,440
and fungi's will eat away and start in

1167
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,640
the d thought process or even inside the

1168
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,159
fridge right

1169
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:35,039
so you want to cool it down enough where

1170
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:36,639
you don't promote that kind of

1171
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,719
warmer situation where you'll get like

1172
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:41,598
fungi's and things

1173
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:43,519
to grow and keep it nice and clean so

1174
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,519
screening it

1175
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:46,559
getting it into a container of some kind

1176
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,159
and then getting the air out which is

1177
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:50,320
why i'm more of a fan of yeah

1178
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,358
whether you get it onto a plate or tin

1179
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,559
foil like you were saying or whatever

1180
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:53,119
different techniques are and you kind of

1181
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:54,719
shake some

1182
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,800
and you scoop it up a little spoon get

1183
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,919
it into you can put it into vials things

1184
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,880
like that but it's harder to get the

1185
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,119
oxygen out

1186
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,640
where with like a little baggie you can

1187
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,559
if you store them in bags you can even

1188
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,000
just kind of press the air out right

1189
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:08,320
and just get most the air out and then

1190
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,559
that will help with long-term storage

1191
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,519
so getting the air out and then keeping

1192
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:15,279
the natural moisture level it was at

1193
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:17,039
cool down then you're going to create a

1194
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,720
good environment for that pollen to stay

1195
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,358
moist enough where it's viable

1196
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:22,959
but doesn't degrade and doesn't also get

1197
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:24,960
eaten away at some kind of pest

1198
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,240
good info really good info there let's

1199
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,159
move on to the female

1200
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:30,319
selection process so we talked about

1201
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:31,598
males now let's talk about females

1202
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,119
so you said it was a little bit

1203
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,480
different of a process when you're

1204
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,079
selecting females

1205
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,920
how do you select females what's your

1206
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,640
process um the nice thing about females

1207
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,280
is that you kind of

1208
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,400
can i still lend myself away and again

1209
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,519
different people can have different

1210
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,720
techniques i

1211
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:46,559
encourage people to have different

1212
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:48,159
techniques um for what they do so just

1213
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,320
because i do something a certain way

1214
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,000
um doesn't mean it's the right way to go

1215
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,039
about it or do it

1216
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,559
because i'm have such a heavy background

1217
00:36:55,039 --> 00:37:01,199
in creating clones um

1218
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:01,838
trying to find specific traits that are

1219
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,199
expressed

1220
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:07,440
and finding unique things then i will

1221
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:10,000
hunt or what we call pheno

1222
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,159
phenol hunt out females and then use

1223
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,880
those as my base

1224
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:16,960
line now whether i get into fleel

1225
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,760
breeding or i just use back crossing

1226
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,960
quite a bit um and that work lends

1227
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,920
itself really well

1228
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,559
for like our particular like medicinal

1229
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,599
style

1230
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:28,639
or hemp braiding and stuff that uh yeah

1231
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,200
for females

1232
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,159
i generally go to hunt for you know what

1233
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,799
i would want to

1234
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:36,319
run as a mono crop i find something that

1235
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,760
would be great to run just as

1236
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,440
propagation for clones

1237
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,800
so you clone a bunch and then you run

1238
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,960
all whole tray or a whole room

1239
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,400
just in that one crop so i'll find

1240
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,800
things that i

1241
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,920
to me are something i would love to grow

1242
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,839
in larger production

1243
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,000
and then we'll take that as our baseline

1244
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:54,400
and then use that either for allele

1245
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,280
crossing um f1 style crossing and

1246
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,240
hybridization

1247
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,160
or we'll use it for back crossing into

1248
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:00,959
future generations to try and stabilize

1249
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:03,598
those traits

1250
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,159
into being when you grow the seeds out

1251
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,400
hopefully

1252
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:07,920
or eventually if you get it right you

1253
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,280
can get those seeds to basically what

1254
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,720
they call stable

1255
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,920
and not to be confused with i know the

1256
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:13,598
terminology a lot people are like oh

1257
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,440
they're stable like as if they're stable

1258
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,200
against hermaphroditic traits

1259
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,720
which is true it can be stable against

1260
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:21,039
the maverick traits but the word

1261
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:21,759
stable when it comes to saying seeds are

1262
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:23,358
stable

1263
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,440
means that they come out like a

1264
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:28,078
monoculture that

1265
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,599
99 of the traits that they display that

1266
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,440
the girls are displaying

1267
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,359
they almost look like clones that would

1268
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,599
be stability or true stability

1269
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:37,519
so we're getting closer to stability and

1270
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,559
a lot quicker with back crossing

1271
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:42,159
so start with some baseline thing um and

1272
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:42,719
then you just you're back crossing to

1273
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:44,000
those

1274
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:45,039
you'll end up getting down as long as

1275
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,719
you don't run into some weird odd

1276
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:47,358
mutation um and everything's pretty

1277
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:51,358
healthy

1278
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:53,838
then you can get those seeds by bx4 bx5

1279
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:55,358
um there's some nuances in there and

1280
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:55,679
some things that we do see depending on

1281
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:57,279
what

1282
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:00,000
back cross generation it is and depends

1283
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,040
on the particular strain line

1284
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,358
but usually by bx 6 or so you should

1285
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:06,800
have a pretty stable run of just seeds

1286
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:08,319
and then so now you have seeds in the

1287
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,000
same way you could produce

1288
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,760
just those clones by propagating but the

1289
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,280
nice thing about seeds unlike clones

1290
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,440
is that seeds can stay viable for years

1291
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,839
without with just some decent storage

1292
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,920
and still get perfect propagation

1293
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:22,880
so then it just kind of depends on you

1294
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,639
know what

1295
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,800
way in agriculture do you want to hold

1296
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:29,598
moms clones or seeds things like that

1297
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,480
okay and when it comes to the actual

1298
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,960
pollination

1299
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,719
process right i feel like if you're if

1300
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,920
you're trying to pollinate a female too

1301
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:37,598
early you could

1302
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,200
mess things up if it's too late you

1303
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,680
could kind of mess things up as far as

1304
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:42,239
like

1305
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:43,440
your overall yield on seeds or however

1306
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:45,279
you want to say it

1307
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,800
around what day of flower would you

1308
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,960
suggest you know what do you think is

1309
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,839
like the best day to pollinate

1310
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,920
so i'm a big believer in nature and for

1311
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:56,239
how many seeds the plants produce

1312
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,440
for the average person going into this

1313
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:00,000
you are going to get

1314
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,760
so many seeds that you should never

1315
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,079
really worry about trying to do what we

1316
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,040
call

1317
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,720
seed production runs where you'll

1318
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:08,960
purposely grow the females out

1319
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,159
to like week three before even setting a

1320
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,920
male into flowering

1321
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:13,679
so that way by the time the male opens

1322
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,318
up and starts producing pollen at his

1323
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:16,318
week three

1324
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:17,920
the females are say at week six and we

1325
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:19,119
all know that a six week old female is

1326
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,039
going to have a lot more flower sites a

1327
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,400
lot more pistols a lot more calyx sites

1328
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:23,759
to be able to absorb pollen

1329
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,240
and you're going to be able to get more

1330
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,319
seed out of it

1331
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:30,078
to me it one it depends on the strain

1332
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:30,800
and two it's kind of negligible i mean

1333
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,760
there are so

1334
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,519
many seeds that it's it's not really

1335
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,599
that much more production to me i think

1336
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,679
that would be something i would talk to

1337
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,640
um when it comes to production for

1338
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:42,000
facilities

1339
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:43,440
when facilities are trying to do it so

1340
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,119
if i were counseling that then we could

1341
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,760
start eating the nuance with particular

1342
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,000
strains

1343
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,440
but even when you're first breeding and

1344
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,039
you just want to keep things natural

1345
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,679
again back to the healthy and strong

1346
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:54,159
thing

1347
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:55,039
if you put males in with the females

1348
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:57,039
they know that

1349
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:58,480
they are sending out signals to each

1350
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,000
other right

1351
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,599
they're picking that up and the females

1352
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,760
will grow just with a male in the

1353
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,920
vicinity you will see them grow

1354
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,040
slightly differently because they know

1355
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,720
that there's a male there and they are

1356
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:09,358
bumping themselves up getting ready for

1357
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:12,559
it

1358
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:14,880
um the other way is that they will

1359
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:16,639
they want to get seeded and so they'll

1360
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,960
start putting out

1361
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,559
and you we can smell it in terpenes

1362
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,159
right the females will start putting a

1363
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,000
lot of production into like trying to

1364
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:27,279
basically be sexy

1365
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,559
and um that to me lends itself more to

1366
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,599
like they want to get

1367
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:31,759
seeds in and you can get a lot of

1368
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,960
production but i find

1369
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,400
healthier better phenotypes from females

1370
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,039
that like had a male and they were ready

1371
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,358
to go

1372
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:41,039
right at the same time period because in

1373
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:42,400
nature the males are going to grow in a

1374
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:44,159
field

1375
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,519
with the females randomly or in the same

1376
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:48,399
environment under the same

1377
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:49,920
lighting system lighting times or photo

1378
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,000
period times excuse me

1379
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,680
so they're going to get the same basic

1380
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,639
signals from those environmental

1381
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:56,639
conditions

1382
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:58,000
to start up their production on whether

1383
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,078
or not they're going to be

1384
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,599
getting seed or not getting seed so i

1385
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,000
think it stresses out the females a

1386
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,960
little bit

1387
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,559
more uh when you hold that back from

1388
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,920
them and it's fine when we're just using

1389
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:09,199
the female flower product and that's

1390
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,960
what we're getting it for we're using it

1391
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:11,439
for a specific thing we've bred them to

1392
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,679
have these

1393
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,358
big fat flowers for example right or

1394
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,519
same with cucumbers and stuff

1395
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,039
we've bred them to get real big and not

1396
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:22,159
have any seeds

1397
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:24,719
bananas um examples et cetera

1398
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:26,239
so you kind of have to look past like

1399
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:27,439
what we've done for breeding and whatnot

1400
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:30,000
and what's really stressing the plan

1401
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,599
out and overall that is a stress so

1402
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,358
getting the males in early when you're

1403
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,119
just trying to find the best things

1404
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:37,598
is always my recommendation is what i go

1405
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,280
for is just let the males get in there

1406
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,480
naturally because the females are still

1407
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,160
going to produce

1408
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,199
more than enough seed even when you're

1409
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:47,279
doing production on a personal level

1410
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,799
i find that to be the best way and then

1411
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,760
also logistically it just makes it much

1412
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,680
easier

1413
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,040
so everything kind of lines itself up to

1414
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:53,679
just like get the males in with the

1415
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:55,440
females

1416
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,519
and let them have a party that makes

1417
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,440
sense i was going to ask you about

1418
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:02,000
yield now generally speaking i mean you

1419
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,159
can you can veg a plant out fill up like

1420
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,920
a four by four space and then

1421
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:07,199
pollinate that plant you're gonna get a

1422
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,599
lot more

1423
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,239
seeds than you would a smaller plant

1424
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,559
right

1425
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:14,239
so kind of generally speaking you know

1426
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,000
do you have a recommended size plant to

1427
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:18,000
pollinate and like roughly how many

1428
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,639
seeds can potentially yield it from that

1429
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,199
size

1430
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:22,400
yeah of course again strains or as

1431
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,399
you're kind of like pointing like

1432
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,160
strains are gonna dependent i mean how

1433
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,440
big they are different ones do

1434
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:29,118
it's just like female just when you're

1435
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,720
even going for flower production for

1436
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,079
that kind of thing with like total sense

1437
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:34,959
of mean no seeds

1438
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,839
right um you're going different strains

1439
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,199
are going to lend themselves to

1440
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:38,318
different training techniques

1441
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:39,919
obviously with breeding you start

1442
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:40,880
getting a male into something like a

1443
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,880
chamber

1444
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,400
then you're not gonna be able to train

1445
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,440
them out as well you're gonna get to a

1446
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,720
point where if they're locked in a

1447
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,318
chamber you can't get in there and like

1448
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:50,078
strip down certain families and still

1449
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:51,679
try and promote certain kinds of growth

1450
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,359
it's gonna be a little bit more

1451
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,000
difficult challenge unless you're doing

1452
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:55,679
the

1453
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
pollen collection gonna do bagging of

1454
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:59,199
certain branches um but even then if

1455
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,400
you're doing that kind of technique well

1456
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:01,519
you're not going for tons of seed you're

1457
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,680
just trying to get enough

1458
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:04,960
uh seed variety out that you can go and

1459
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:05,838
experiment and find some different

1460
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,519
phenotypes

1461
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:11,599
okay gotcha let's get into feminized

1462
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:13,280
seeds so becoming more and more popular

1463
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,599
right you have regular seeds which can

1464
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,359
be

1465
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,119
they can end up being a male plant or a

1466
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:17,598
female plant you have feminized seeds

1467
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,720
which

1468
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:22,400
are supposed to be always female that's

1469
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:23,759
going to happen but they're supposed to

1470
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,519
be so how would

1471
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,040
feather knives they're supposed to be

1472
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:30,239
displaying

1473
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:32,000
just their female traits so um that

1474
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:34,959
that's what they're attempting to do is

1475
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,719
get them there now hemp itself has a

1476
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,639
natural mutation somewhere along the

1477
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:41,039
line we don't know exactly where like

1478
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:42,318
we have been going in and out of

1479
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:45,440
production for

1480
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:47,199
hemp for thousands of years and there

1481
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,720
are things that like in the 60s and 70s

1482
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:50,399
when all the hippies went out and found

1483
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:51,919
all the crazy stuff that was still out

1484
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,559
and around or near farms and

1485
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,599
you know vietnam or somewhere and some

1486
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:57,440
of them were wild

1487
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,960
well they weren't really wild if we look

1488
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,960
back in the genetics of these plants we

1489
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,559
can tell that they had gone through some

1490
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,599
kind of selection process and

1491
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:07,279
humans were involved in moving them

1492
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,480
towards different kinds of traits in

1493
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,280
those areas

1494
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,960
so it is a crop that we have had our

1495
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,240
hands in for a long time

1496
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,960
even when it has gone back to wild this

1497
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:19,679
so they do display these traits of what

1498
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,000
we call

1499
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:22,719
hermaphrodite right traits where they

1500
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
will um

1501
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:28,000
just like uh plants that have

1502
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,679
just have male and female parts they'll

1503
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,719
kind of do the same thing

1504
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:35,679
um so we can basically leverage that

1505
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:36,879
trait this hermaphroditic trait to and

1506
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:39,279
this is where we get into

1507
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,800
even those females though um will still

1508
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,839
have chromosomes

1509
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:47,359
that are displaying both um xx

1510
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:48,639
y so both an x and a y chromosomes

1511
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:51,039
this is why if you give them a little

1512
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:51,358
bit of a stress they're much more likely

1513
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:54,800
to

1514
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:56,639
show those traits but even the

1515
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,359
males and females that you get in true

1516
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:02,078
breeding still have this stress trait

1517
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:02,880
in their genetics and most likely from

1518
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,800
the

1519
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,559
nature we can imagine you get to the

1520
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,400
fall time a female's there

1521
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:10,159
self-preservation there were no males to

1522
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,400
pollinate it at the end

1523
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:15,598
it'll it'll pollinate itself frost is

1524
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,480
coming it'll throw out some male

1525
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,440
male sacks pollen will come it'll

1526
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,599
pollinate itself

1527
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,480
and at least it'll keep that thing going

1528
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,160
into the next

1529
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,920
year the next season after the frost or

1530
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:26,639
whatever it is wherever that environment

1531
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,559
is

1532
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:30,078
so that's where we can theoretically

1533
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:31,199
like imagine that that's where that

1534
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,880
trait comes from

1535
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:35,919
and so we're trying to leverage that

1536
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,318
trait by then producing

1537
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,000
um plants that will only show female

1538
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:41,039
flowers a trait for only displaying

1539
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,760
female flowers

1540
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:44,639
and we don't have to worry about that so

1541
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,720
that's where we

1542
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:48,719
get into the feminized breeding that's

1543
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:50,239
why it works that way

1544
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:51,679
and it works great if you're super

1545
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:52,399
healthy and you're super good about your

1546
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:55,440
selection

1547
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,599
then you can absolutely feminize as we

1548
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,318
call it like this branding term

1549
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,160
into seeds unfortunately a lot of people

1550
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:04,559
in a lot of breeders and places

1551
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:06,318
just don't take the time to one make the

1552
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:08,318
proper selection to get down

1553
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:09,759
to make sure that like they're stress

1554
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:11,440
tested everything like that and it takes

1555
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,880
a lot of time it's one of the reasons i

1556
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,000
stay away from it i've done a lot of

1557
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,400
that for pheno hunting

1558
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,519
to go find strains out of clones and to

1559
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,079
make clones

1560
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,599
because you can find a clone out of

1561
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,160
feminized seeds right

1562
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,240
that has all the traits you want doesn't

1563
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:28,078
show the hermaphroditic traits

1564
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:29,598
is really strong and so that's easy to

1565
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,440
pick so i don't have to go that far down

1566
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,960
in fem breeding to find good clones and

1567
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,800
then be able to then maybe add some

1568
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,800
males back in there re-hybridize out the

1569
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,880
genetics kind of get it reset

1570
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,400
but still grab those traits that are

1571
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,760
dominant mostly

1572
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,200
for those particular strains in

1573
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,119
other places though if you give them the

1574
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:48,078
stress people may see like oh in their

1575
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,559
environment

1576
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,440
they smashed you know two females

1577
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,359
together and one of them they

1578
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,159
hermaphrodited for feminized seeds made

1579
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:56,480
femme seeds

1580
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:57,920
in their um environment it seemed fine

1581
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,400
they didn't get any aphrodite traits but

1582
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,920
then

1583
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,680
tons of people are reporting back that

1584
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,639
they share those seeds with that they're

1585
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:04,078
having issues

1586
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:05,358
and so that's where you run into this

1587
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,318
issue over and over again where

1588
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:07,759
sometimes

1589
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:09,119
people love femme seeds they never have

1590
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,160
any problems it's all great good

1591
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,000
breeding was done

1592
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:13,679
great selection was done and then in

1593
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,280
other places

1594
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:16,639
it wasn't maybe even good selection was

1595
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,280
done but in their environment so you

1596
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,879
have to really

1597
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,559
expose them to a lot of different

1598
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,440
environments to be able to

1599
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,880
figure out whether or not those traits

1600
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,639
will be expressed

1601
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,318
where for myself yeah i stick to a lot

1602
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,799
of true breeding because

1603
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:31,920
even if those are in strains that we use

1604
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,440
those kinds of traits

1605
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,480
they definitely aren't displayed as much

1606
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,838
and they seem to be healthier and be

1607
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,559
able to get through a lot more stressful

1608
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:38,719
situations

1609
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,000
by having the variety in that genetics

1610
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:43,838
especially with the way

1611
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:47,519
excuse me the way that we've hybridized

1612
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:49,838
the entire species itself so much

1613
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:52,159
that's really interesting so you touched

1614
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:55,279
on how feminized these are created

1615
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,000
autoflowers another popular type of seed

1616
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,160
or plant

1617
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,358
how are those seeds created so

1618
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:02,078
autoflowers come

1619
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:02,799
from part of the species the taxonomy

1620
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,000
for that

1621
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:10,400
right is that that is a ruderalis

1622
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,079
so it is related to hemp or is hemp but

1623
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,000
it is started going off in a different

1624
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,960
path like a lion and a tiger

1625
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,679
um we were so they're farther away from

1626
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,159
each other

1627
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:22,078
versus like if you go and look at lions

1628
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:22,879
or um even killer whales like for

1629
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,240
example

1630
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,200
there's two different kinds of killer

1631
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:26,799
whales there's like the northern

1632
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:28,558
hemisphere ones that hang out and then

1633
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,160
there's the lower hemisphere ones and to

1634
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,800
us by eye you might not notice the

1635
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:32,639
difference

1636
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,240
but actually if you study them they've

1637
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:34,719
sort of started to bridge away from each

1638
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:36,959
other

1639
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:38,159
and one is smaller than the other one

1640
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,079
have a little bit different social

1641
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:41,598
interactions etc

1642
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,119
but they're not totally different with

1643
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,000
something they can't breed so same with

1644
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,519
lions right like

1645
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,639
lions can be that way too you think like

1646
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:47,920
all lions are the same but actually

1647
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:49,199
there's some different depending on the

1648
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,920
zones and where they are

1649
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:53,039
like in say africa for example where

1650
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,838
lions are in different place

1651
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:55,119
environments

1652
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:57,199
they've gone away from each other but

1653
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,880
you take those lines back together and

1654
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:00,318
you'll there's still lions versus a

1655
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,480
tiger which is all the way out

1656
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:03,599
so i look at like rude alice is like a

1657
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,079
tiger

1658
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,640
you sort of you get into breeding that

1659
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,359
with

1660
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:10,960
um what we've made selection for for so

1661
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:12,239
long on our production

1662
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,480
that we've had a lot of hand in you're

1663
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:16,078
going back to something that

1664
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,599
has a slightly different genetic makeup

1665
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,440
now autoflowers are in

1666
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,200
zones and they were pulled in a place

1667
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,159
where they will flower automatically

1668
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:24,879
regardless

1669
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:26,480
of your photo period so photo period

1670
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,318
doesn't affect them that's the trait

1671
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,639
that comes along with them

1672
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:31,838
so what the advantage of that of course

1673
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:33,679
is that if you pop a seed

1674
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:35,039
it will vegetate itself up no matter the

1675
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:35,519
light you could give it 24 hours of

1676
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:37,599
light

1677
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:39,039
it'll do that for three four weeks and

1678
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,000
then it'll just start flowering and you

1679
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:43,440
can leave it on 24

1680
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,000
hours of light and it'll keep flowering

1681
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,440
so that is a great trait for somebody to

1682
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,838
be able to just you know throw a plant

1683
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,639
um in their backyard or on a porch or

1684
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,759
something

1685
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:54,000
and it makes a lot of sense you don't

1686
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:57,280
have to worry about photo periods

1687
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,199
the issue with this is that it's

1688
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,800
really hard to get again we're back to

1689
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,199
dominant and recessive traits

1690
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,039
to be able to pull in the trait so if

1691
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:08,558
the progeny or the offspring

1692
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:09,759
you breed with it with a ruderalis male

1693
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,960
for example there's just you know it

1694
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,160
could be a female or male but we'll just

1695
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,760
say a root or else male

1696
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:15,358
and you take it against your favorite

1697
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,480
at-home medicinal

1698
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:22,400
strain some of those progeny

1699
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:24,318
are going to come out reuteralis

1700
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,559
or autoflower and some of the progeny

1701
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:28,159
won't it will depend on what's dominant

1702
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,319
or recessive now

1703
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:31,199
um some of the traits with a particular

1704
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:33,358
strain maybe

1705
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,838
a bunch of them come out rude or alice

1706
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:36,078
and a bunch of them don't come a

1707
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:37,039
ruralist

1708
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,280
and that's where you have to do the

1709
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:40,880
breeding to get it in in my experience

1710
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,880
with reuter alice because of the

1711
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,200
genetics and the way it's been worked

1712
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:47,280
it's

1713
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:50,879
really tough to get like flavor profiles

1714
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:53,599
color et cetera structure because

1715
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,200
that you want that you love out of your

1716
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:59,119
photoperiod plant

1717
00:51:55,199 --> 00:52:02,399
into an autoflower plant because

1718
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:05,119
the dominant traits for autoflower may

1719
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,920
always go against it being purple for

1720
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,240
example

1721
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,200
so sure all the progeny you can get them

1722
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:10,879
all down

1723
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:12,159
to being all rude or alice after a

1724
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,440
couple of generations of breeding or a

1725
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,118
few generations

1726
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,559
but to get it down to all them being

1727
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,039
rude or alice you'll never get the

1728
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,160
purple

1729
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:21,279
it'll always be recessive against and

1730
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:23,440
that's just one

1731
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,640
example of something that you could and

1732
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,519
will run into when

1733
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:29,118
breeding with that verse if you do

1734
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,800
feminize seeds right and you sell

1735
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,318
something or self it against another or

1736
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,800
at least put female

1737
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:37,199
male hermaphrodite pollen onto a female

1738
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,280
all those seeds are going to be

1739
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:41,039
that way so it's much easier to get to

1740
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,559
you won't see that

1741
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:44,000
with feminized seeds right well it's not

1742
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,119
like with feminized seeds some of them

1743
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,400
turn out to be male and some someone

1744
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,358
turned out to be feeble no no they're

1745
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,639
all gonna

1746
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:52,719
majority wise show that female trait

1747
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:53,440
but um when it comes to reuteralis

1748
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:54,558
you're talking about something

1749
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,679
completely different so

1750
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,599
then you really have to worry about the

1751
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:59,279
recessive and dominant genes to get that

1752
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,440
and that's where you get that battle

1753
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,960
where some people are like oh i ordered

1754
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,639
rudolph seeds and like

1755
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,079
some a couple of them were but most of

1756
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,920
them weren't even that

1757
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,440
and they wouldn't they're not photo

1758
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,440
they're just regular photoperiod plants

1759
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,280
and that's because the work wasn't done

1760
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,960
to make sure that you got those traits

1761
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,240
along with it and to stabilize it so

1762
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,400
back to stabilizing

1763
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:19,598
a particular strain which is going to be

1764
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,960
much more important when doing

1765
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:22,960
autoflowering

1766
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,240
and autoflower breeding to stabilize

1767
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,400
everything especially for

1768
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:27,519
that particular trait because that's the

1769
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,280
trait you're looking for

1770
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:30,800
gotcha yeah i was going to ask you who

1771
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,800
uh you know

1772
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,000
there's more and more people reaching

1773
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,760
out to me saying that they

1774
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,838
they got autos but they're not actually

1775
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,000
autos and i i honestly feel bad

1776
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:41,759
it seems to be the same breeders uh

1777
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,079
first number one i won't expose anybody

1778
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,440
in

1779
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:47,039
in this video but uh is it you know

1780
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,200
a lot of these home growers they just

1781
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:49,679
have one space to grow in and if you've

1782
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:51,679
got

1783
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:53,199
a plant that's not actually an auto and

1784
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:54,719
you need to flip it to 1212 what do you

1785
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:55,598
do like there's a lot of people that are

1786
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:58,159
just

1787
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,119
they're stuck at that point so um yeah

1788
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:01,358
you touched on

1789
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,318
how that can actually happen so it's

1790
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:04,480
just you know

1791
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:05,358
not stabilizing and so on and so forth

1792
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,800
it's just uh

1793
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:08,480
it's sad to see some of that stuff

1794
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,119
people it kind of seems like things are

1795
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,480
rushed

1796
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,400
in a sense just to get it out on the

1797
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,079
market you know so

1798
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,160
you know that and that's the age-old

1799
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:19,440
problem even before rude or alice

1800
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:22,399
um autoflower had become fairly popular

1801
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,760
over the last years um 10 15 years and

1802
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,119
it's really taken off

1803
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,480
that's the same problem right we get

1804
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,760
with feminized seeds where people get

1805
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,199
complaints like oh well i'm everything's

1806
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,559
from mapper dieting at week six i can't

1807
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,759
even make it past week six and then

1808
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,920
suddenly

1809
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,680
it's showing its trait that normally

1810
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,559
would show at week 12 or something

1811
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:40,159
in in like a normal true female um it

1812
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,000
would still throw that hermit

1813
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:43,679
hemophilic trait show to try and

1814
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,480
self-pulling itself under stress

1815
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:48,000
but instead it's overtaken and now you

1816
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,719
can't even get past week six with those

1817
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,719
progeny

1818
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:52,078
without it um flipping over and then

1819
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:54,798
also kind of a fun note

1820
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:56,400
about plants just so some people just to

1821
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:59,119
kind of get in your idea in your head

1822
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,559
when it comes to true breed you can also

1823
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:03,358
do this to males

1824
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:05,680
so you can take a male and stress it out

1825
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:07,759
and run it long enough and it will

1826
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:09,279
throw female pistols and flowers and

1827
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,200
seed itself

1828
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,960
and all of your seeds that come from

1829
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:16,159
that male will be

1830
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:18,240
maleized they will majority show the

1831
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:19,598
male trait and come out as males

1832
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:21,199
but then they'll be throwing female

1833
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,240
pistols and things so if you see that in

1834
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:22,558
your males and everything then you know

1835
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:24,959
like

1836
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,240
okay this somewhere along the line this

1837
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,440
has kind of ended up happening and it

1838
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,879
happens with tons of strains i've run

1839
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,480
across because i too

1840
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,920
standing on the shoulders of giants i'm

1841
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,679
working with gear

1842
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,119
right like even if it was a long time

1843
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:35,679
ago at some point i started with gear

1844
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:37,200
that

1845
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:38,960
i have no idea what the history is of it

1846
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:40,480
i'm i'm told to certain things i can try

1847
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,760
and look it up from

1848
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,119
the names and from where it comes from

1849
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,960
in that time period but

1850
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,318
you never quite know where along the

1851
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,599
past something happened

1852
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:51,519
but that's kind of a fun weird thing

1853
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,880
about like feminized breeding is that it

1854
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:54,318
also goes the other way too

1855
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,798
super interesting i didn't know that

1856
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:58,558
yeah that's really interesting

1857
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:00,159
cool well we can go on and on and on and

1858
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,960
on but we're gonna we're gonna wrap

1859
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:02,960
things up here

1860
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,480
can you uh tell us how the listeners can

1861
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,199
find you and what you've got upcoming in

1862
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:09,119
the future

1863
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:12,000
oh yeah um we uh we're in california

1864
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,960
um we run i have run a company called

1865
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,679
ocean grown

1866
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,079
uh for quite some time the best way to

1867
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:18,159
find

1868
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,160
us is we either run on our discord or

1869
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:22,480
you can just go to our website

1870
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:23,199
it's purely educational site no issues

1871
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,159
with that

1872
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:27,759
you can find information about where to

1873
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:29,519
find different kinds of products or what

1874
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,280
the available producers are

1875
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:32,960
and then i also have a youtube channel

1876
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,040
that i've been running as we mentioned

1877
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,798
it's just vader og or you can type in

1878
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:38,159
vader vision um it's kind of like the

1879
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:41,599
show that i run through

1880
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:42,000
that uh production so over on youtube

1881
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:45,760
you can

1882
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,519
find me there and some resource

1883
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,040
videos available and then if you want to

1884
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:50,239
talk to us though or even get a hold of

1885
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:50,960
me a little bit more you have questions

1886
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:53,199
about things

1887
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,559
in the community our discord has been um

1888
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:56,719
i used to be big on forums

1889
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:58,319
so i loved forums unless you used to be

1890
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:59,838
able to find me but i've gone away from

1891
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:02,000
that with the newer technology

1892
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:04,078
um into a much more simpler platform

1893
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,440
that allows a lot more access so

1894
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,200
even if you can't just talk to me you

1895
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,240
can talk to people in the team

1896
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:10,879
that are going to be able to help you

1897
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:13,118
out so over at our discord ocean grown

1898
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,880
discord and then also you've got a

1899
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,079
podcast that you're a part of now huh

1900
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,200
you want to talk a little bit about that

1901
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,599
growers workshop

1902
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:20,719
oh we've started running a podcast yes

1903
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,760
for girls workshop we usually get the

1904
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:23,759
community together

1905
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,680
um we used to have a show growtube a lot

1906
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,640
of people uh know and that was great to

1907
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:28,480
be able to get a lot of people in our

1908
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:31,039
particular community together

1909
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,559
um that is still there to a degree

1910
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:34,159
although we've kind of stepped away from

1911
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,079
it um we have some issues with youtube

1912
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:38,078
and banning channels and deleting things

1913
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,839
so this time around very similarly we

1914
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,519
have created a podcast where we can talk

1915
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:44,719
about these subjects

1916
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:46,639
but keep them available for information

1917
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:48,318
that youtube's not going to remove it so

1918
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:49,759
we try to start this podcast where we

1919
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:51,920
can still talk a little bit

1920
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,200
more openly but with the right

1921
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,480
nomenclature the right

1922
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:57,118
language to express the information out

1923
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,440
there

1924
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,960
so growers workshop is uh the podcast

1925
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,318
we've been running and then there is

1926
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,079
some idea and plans for

1927
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:05,358
um also that's where we've been putting

1928
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:07,200
like build out

1929
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:09,119
stuff chambers things so for people who

1930
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:10,159
want to like be able to do breeding

1931
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,318
and you want to be able to have a

1932
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:13,759
chamber area that is going to be good

1933
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:14,719
enough not to let pollen out and

1934
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,799
pollinate you know

1935
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:18,239
some females and stuff right nearby and

1936
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:18,960
this can work for orchids and all kinds

1937
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,199
of stuff

1938
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,880
but these um that is a great place also

1939
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:25,519
to find that kind of information

1940
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,400
and it's less it's more grow wide and

1941
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:29,679
same with um

1942
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:31,838
i do do like permaculture

1943
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:33,358
we do hydroponics outdoors for veggies

1944
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:35,358
for all kinds of other things so

1945
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:36,719
that kind of stuff is also a resource

1946
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:38,480
for those looking to do

1947
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:40,000
that kind of stuff but it's slowly

1948
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,039
building it's new so

1949
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,599
if you go over there and it doesn't seem

1950
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:45,119
like there's too much information we're

1951
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,599

1990
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:49,920
connected us

1991
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,599
to make this happen got to give him a

1992
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,280
shout out so absolutely thanks for

1993
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:54,880
having me on and um and of course and

1994
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,798
for anyone listening like at

1995
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,920
drop questions on whatever platform

1996
00:59:56,798 --> 00:59:59,599
you're watching it on

1997
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,119
i'm sure i will rotate back through i

1998
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,798
can get into more detail i can even be

1999
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,599
prepared with some research if somebody

2000
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:05,119
brings up something

2001
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,119
theoretical or just something that they

2002
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:08,559
want to know about um there's it's

2003
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,000
really tough in these kinds of podcasts

2004
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:12,079
so like yeah keep it within an hour or

2005
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,358
45 minutes um because i can tangent

2006
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,359
really quick into other

2007
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:17,039
kinds of concepts so keeping that kind

2008
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:17,358
of baseline so hopefully we knocked out

2009
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:19,759
the

2010
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:20,880
the beginner stuff but um absolutely get

2011
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,640
down in there and

2012
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,920
ask away and i can i will definitely

2013
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:24,400

2014
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,760
