Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast,

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,080
where we interview growers from all over

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,679
the world, both beginners and experts,

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,519
seeking to learn more about what they

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,839
know about gardening and how they do

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,960
things in their

7
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,239
garden. What's up everybody? For those

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,640
of you that don't know me, my name is

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,559
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,800
in to the Garden Dog podcast. This

11
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,879
episode number 170. In this episode, I

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,599
interview Susan Poisoner. She is an

13
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,518
award-winning author and ISA certified

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,159
aubberist with 15 years gardening

15
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,320
experience. She is widely regarded as an

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,479
expert in pruning, which is exactly what

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,039
we'll be diving into in today's episode.

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,679
Susan not only discusses why pruning is

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,839
essential, but also the ideal timing,

20
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,000
specific techniques, how to fix

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,600
structural issues, and more. If you want

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,439

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,239
where I show the plants that I grow.

26
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,000
Both of those channels will be linked

27

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,520
below. One of my goals for this podcast

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,359
is to bring free information about

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,800
gardening to the general public. That

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,719
being said, I'd like to thank the

Poisoner. How you doing today? I'm doing

72
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,719
great. Thank you so much, Chris, for

73
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,319
having me on your show. Yeah, thanks for

74
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,598
joining me. So today we're going to talk

75
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:41,679
all about pruning. And this is something

76
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,399
that you are regarded as an expert in.

77
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,040
You have lots of experience doing this.

78
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,879
You're an award-winning author and uh

79
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,519
you've got just so much experience with

80
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:53,039
so many different trees and that's what

81
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,480
we're going to get into today. And I

82
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,318
think like we were talking about before

83
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,000
we start recording, a majority of my

84
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,238
audience really focuses on growing

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,400
medicinal plants. And I think it's going

86
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,920
to be interesting for them to hear this

87
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,080
because there are so many different ways

88
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,318
to do the pruning process and depending

89
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,360
on what plant you're growing, well, you

90
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:10,958
could do things a little bit differently

91
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,239
from plant to plant. So, I think it's

92
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,360
going to be really interesting for my

93
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,200
audience to hear about the different

94
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,200
ways to do things and potentially have

95
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,359
some takeaways, compare how they do

96
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,878
their pruning to what you're mentioning,

97
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,640
and then potentially take away some best

98
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,799
practices and implement in their garden.

99
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,958
So, I'm really excited for this one.

100
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,159
Before we get too deep into the topic,

101
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,598
something we like to do is an

102
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,120
introduction. Can you tell us a little

103
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,000
bit about yourself and how you got into

104
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,920
gardening? Absolutely. So, I always

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,759
chuckle when people call me an expert in

106
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,639
pruning or fruit trees. Now, I have been

107
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,439
doing this for 15 years, but I started

108
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,279
later in life. Like I I grew up not

109
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,479
touching the soil like I didn't plant

110
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,959
seeds. I didn't do anything. My

111
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,280
background is as a journalist, a BBC

112
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,120
trained journalist. I lived in England,

113
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,759
traveled the world, did some really

114
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,840
interesting things. When I came back to

115
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,798
Canada, which is where I live, I met my

116
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,959
husband, Cliff, who's from Trinidad. And

117
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,519
in Trinidad, you plant any seed, the

118
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,920
tree pops up. It's like amazing. Any any

119
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,360
trees, any shrubs, any everything. They

120
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,518
can grow everything there. The climate

121
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,720
is warm. It's beautiful. And so when we

122
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,199
moved in together, he looked at the

123
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,798
backyard and he said, "Oh, we can plant

124
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,478
some good stuff back there." And I'm

125
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:24,159
like, "No, we are not. No way. Because

126
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,319
you're going to plant stuff and I'm

127
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,840
going to have to take care of it. I know

128
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,000
and I'm not doing it. It's going to be a

129
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,439
lot of work. And we negotiated back and

130
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,360
forth. And then he said, "Okay, well,

131
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,160
I'll do some just a little bit of tomato

132
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,919
plants." So, I go out that day. I come

133
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,919
back. The whole backyard is filled with

134
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:43,279
tomato plants and God knows what else he

135
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:45,758
planted. And I was so mad. And that

136
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:49,359
whole summer, I fell in love with

137
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,000
gardening because I love food and I love

138
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,160
fresh fruits. and it tasted so much

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,279
better than any of the things you can

140
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,360
get in the in the uh supermarket. So,

141
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,918
the long story short is I ended up

142
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,520
studying garden

143
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:05,839
design and

144
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:09,519
uh when I did that, I realized that what

145
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:12,399
spoke to me was trees. And fruit trees

146
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,000
are amazing. Not only do they do all the

147
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,918
wonderful things that trees do, they

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,279
shade our communities, they beautify our

149
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:21,959
gardens, um they clean our air, but

150
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:25,439
fruit trees feed us and they are so

151
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:27,680
generous. And so that started my my

152
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,000
adventure where I planted a community

153
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,639
orchard in my local park thinking it was

154
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,478
going to be easy because, you know,

155
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,319
zucchini plants, you have to weed around

156
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,879
them, you have to take care of them,

157
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,478
tomato plants, whatever. trees, you

158
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,079
plant them and water them and just wait

159
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,599
for your harvest. Am I right, Chris?

160
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:48,800
Like easy, huh? You've got this knowing

161
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,199
look on your face, right? And so, in the

162
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,280
end, I realized these trees I planted

163
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,960
were in a public space. There were

164
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,879
actually were people who did not want me

165
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,560
to do this project and warned me and

166
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,839
said, "Look, fruit trees can be a

167
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,759
problem. Don't do it." And I was like,

168
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,560
"No, I'll look into it. I promise I'll

169
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,560
do it real good." And in the end it was

170
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,160
just a blessing for me because it it

171
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,280
ended up being an interesting and

172
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,520
challenging journey um with pest and

173
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,159
disease issues with you know lack of

174
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,719
growth not enough growth and the

175
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,960
solution that I could do in the park was

176
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,039
fruit tree pruning because it's not

177
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,519
chemical and it does everything that you

178
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:33,680
want it to do. It helps to protect the

179
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:36,079
tree from disease issues and from pests

180
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,759
and it helps encourage growth. We had

181
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,240
planted these puny little trees that

182
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,560
were staying puny. Little did I know

183
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,360
that pruning wasn't necessarily making

184
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,519
the trees smaller. It was encouraging

185
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,639
growth in certain ways and at certain

186
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:53,198
times of year. So, the most empowering

187
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,800
way to learn to care for your trees is

188
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,879
actually the first step is to prune

189
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,319
them. Don't worry about the chemicals.

190
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,719
Hopefully, you don't need them. There's

191
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,520
certain that I might recommend organic,

192
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,440
of course, but pruning is the answer to

193
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,279
your prayers and it's a skill and it can

194
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,439
be learned very easily. You did a great

195
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,038
job explaining some of the reasons why

196
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,319
it's so important. I'm not sure if

197
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,159
there's anything else to say about that.

198
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,879
I know a lot of folks they'll do it for

199
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,039
bigger yields, right? Because uh from my

200
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,279
understanding, some of these and I'm so

201
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,959
new to growing trees. We kind of briefly

202
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,038
talked about this. I have five trees in

203
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,839
my backyard. I have a fig tree. I have a

204
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:31,360
pomegranate. I have a bunch of citrus

205
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:33,758
trees. It's grapefruit, mandarin, lemon,

206
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,360
and lime. It's all different as far as

207
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,800
how to prune them. From my

208
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,439
understanding, some of these if you let

209
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,639
too much fruit go on the branches, that

210
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,800
could be a bad thing. So, you kind of

211
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,639
want to take off some of those flower

212
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,840
sites, I guess, so you don't produce too

213
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,079
much. For example, too many limes on a

214
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,839
particular branch isn't always a good

215
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,598
thing. It it could lead to, I guess,

216
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,359
smaller fruit, right? potentially

217
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,120
smaller yield overall. Can you talk to

218
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,680
us a little bit about how that works?

219
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,160
Yeah, absolutely. So, everything I do,

220
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,918
so here I am relatively 15 years ago,

221
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,000
relatively new to growing fruit trees

222
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,918
and I'm not good. You can tell me to do

223
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,519
stuff and if I don't understand why, I

224
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:13,439
just don't remember to do it, I don't

225
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,878
care about doing it. So, the science is

226
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,800
where I go for all of this stuff. And if

227
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,960
you think about it, you also you're

228
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,360
essentially even feeding your fruit

229
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,959
trees when you prune them properly. So,

230
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,199
let's think of it this way. And I live

231
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,279
in a cold climate where we have a very

232
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,240
obvious dormant season. You guys also

233
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,918
have a dormant season. It's not as

234
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,399
obvious. But what it's the slower the

235
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,958
season where the the tree grows slower.

236
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,799
And what it does is it brings the

237
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,718
nutrients from the leaves down into the

238
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,039
root system for storage. Well, it just

239
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,000
kind of settles in and rests for the the

240
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:51,919
dormant season or the winter. So what

241
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,399
happens is that if you have a tree with

242
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:58,879
lots of branches, that little pot of

243
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:02,559
food, the nutrients has to go out to all

244
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:04,399
those branches. Okay? So in the spring,

245
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,559
all that those nutrients will go up and

246
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,639
let's say there's 10 branches. The

247
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,159
nutrients one/tenth, you know, each

248
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,600
one10enth of the nutrients will go to

249
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:15,519
each branch. If you selectively pruning

250
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,759
those branches out and let's say you

251
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,600
only have seven branches left, you've

252
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,679
got the same pot of nutrients in the

253
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:26,278
root system, but each branch gets a

254
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:29,759
larger share of that energy in the

255
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:33,919
spring. So the result is that those

256
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:38,480
branches will grow longer, get stronger

257
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:44,399
and be able to support more fruit.

258
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:47,680
Now similarly if you let that branch

259
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,159
support 10 pieces of fruit, each fruit

260
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:52,239
will get one/tenth of the energy that

261
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,240
that branch gets. And they might stay

262
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,639
small, they might be a little bit hard,

263
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,639
whatever. But if you thin the fruit,

264
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,759
when I see baby fruitlets on an apple

265
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:05,679
tree or or you know a peach tree or

266
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:07,600
whatever, if you thin the fruits so that

267
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,958
there are fewer fruits, they have lots

268
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,120
of space to grow to be full size. So

269
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,439
you've got fewer fruits, there's more

270
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,560
space, and they get a larger share of

271
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,519
the energy in that branch. So it all

272
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,119
makes sense. In my new book, I I just

273
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,759
written wrote a new book. It's called

274
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,480
fruit tree pruning. The science and art

275
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:32,399
of cultivating healthy fruit trees. And

276
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,159
I talk about all this stuff as the way

277
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,399
when we work with a fruit tree, we're

278
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:37,759
not just making it smaller by pruning it

279
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,839
because we're not. Sometimes we're

280
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,120
making it bigger. We are helping the

281
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:46,399
fruit tree manage its

282
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:49,519
energy. Right? So winter pruning spurs

283
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,679
or or stimulates vigorous growth. Summer

284
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,120
pruning is a little different. And that

285
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,000
I can talk to you if you're interested

286
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,759
about that. Different time of year, the

287
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,919
cycle is a little different. The effect

288
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,360
is different, too. But does that answer

289
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:05,039
your question as to

290
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,480
why some trees if you leave a lot of

291
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,319
fruit on them, you're just going to get

292
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,759
hard kind of not really very interesting

293
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,000
fruit? And if you do your part of the

294
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:17,200
fruit tree care, you're working with the

295
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,679
tree collaborating together to make a

296
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,079
quality harvest. So yeah, let's get a

297
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,919
little bit deeper into the ideal time of

298
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,479
year to prune. I know that's going to be

299
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,078
dependent on what tree or plant that

300
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,680
you're growing. So can you give us some

301
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,078
more information on that one? Yeah, and

302
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:34,159
of course it depends on what climate. So

303
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:37,838
the month will be different here than it

304
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:40,480
will be for you. And I I don't know

305
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,480
where your listeners are from if they're

306
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,200
from all over North America, but the

307
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,879
science is the same wherever you live.

308
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,519
It's just the month the timing is

309
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:53,439
different. So just a minute ago I talked

310
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,519
about winter pruning. So winter pruning

311
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,760
is when you've got and it's really

312
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,480
happens like late winter just before the

313
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:03,919
buds start opening in the spring uh or

314
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,639
the end of the dormcy pre season. So

315
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,159
you've got the nutrients in the root

316
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:10,720
system. They are coming up and if you've

317
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:14,159
pruned out some branches then each

318
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,720
branch gets more energy. It grows bigger

319
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:19,600
and stronger and it can support more

320
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,399
fruit. That's great. But what happens,

321
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,720
Chris, if you say, "Okay, I'm not going

322
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,278
to do I'm not going to do winter

323
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,879
pruning. I'm going to let the energy in

324
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:33,439
the root system come up into the tree,

325
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:36,000
and I'm going to let it push out buds

326
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,839
and flowers and fruit. I'm going to let

327
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,159
this tree run a whole marathon with all

328
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,720
its branches, all 10 branches, all 100

329
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:46,559
branches."

330
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:49,000
So what happens then is you wait for the

331
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:52,078
tree to produce the to to use up all the

332
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,360
energy and then you make some cuts. What

333
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,359
kind of effect would it have? So at that

334
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,120
point it's kind of like I don't know I

335
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,039
don't have kids but I understand that if

336
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,278
you get give kids chocolate or something

337
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,679
before bedtime even if you have

338
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,799
chocolate before bedtime or coffee or

339
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,159
something you're going to be running

340
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:11,639
around in circles and you're not going

341
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:14,480
to want to go to sleep. Right? So

342
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:16,839
essentially, you've got your tree, it's

343
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,240
run a marathon, it's run around in

344
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:22,160
circles, and it's tired. So if at that

345
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,959
point it's used up all the energy in its

346
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:27,360
root system, if you make some cuts,

347
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,919
there's not really that much energy to

348
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,800
go up into the tree. So two interesting

349
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:36,559
things happen here. Very interesting.

350
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:39,359
And one is it doesn't spur lots of new

351
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:41,278
growth. It'll spur a little growth. So,

352
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,600
that kind of thing is perfect if you've

353
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,838
got like that big old cherry tree that

354
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,200
is way too big and you want to bring it

355
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,040
down in size. Then you want to do it

356
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,440
after blossom time. And you know what?

357
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,439
We actually do our cherry trees at

358
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,560
harvest time because it's, you know,

359
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,160
early summer and before we have our

360
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,119
community harvest in a park, I go out

361
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:05,360
with the pole pruners. I go out and we

362
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,879
saw off certain branches because we know

363
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,480
what structure we're trying to create.

364
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,879
And we can even take the cherries off

365
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,278
the high branches, but we know that the

366
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:17,679
tree will not respond by getting even

367
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:19,759
bigger. So, summer pruning slows growth

368
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,000
down. It helps you to keep your tree

369
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:25,679
compact. But here's another interesting

370
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,919
thing. It has to do with hormones. So,

371
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:31,039
the the hormones are these chemicals

372
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:33,599
that tell the tree what to do. And

373
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:35,519
certain hormones like oxen hormones and

374
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,320
I think gibberillin hormones are very

375
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,399
active in the late winter early spring

376
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,120
and they want the tree to get bigger and

377
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,958
to grow shoots. So um winter pruning

378
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,320
spurs growth because those hormones are

379
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:52,078
really active. By summer the oxen

380
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,240
hormones aren't so active. They've gone

381
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:57,120
slowed down. But there's another type of

382
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,560
hormone that likes to direct the energy

383
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:04,278
towards what? Towards fruit production.

384
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:06,719
So if you prune in the summer, the early

385
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:09,519
summer, then you are actually telling

386
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,920
the tree, "Hey kiddo, put some energy

387
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,440
towards either this year's fruit or

388
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:17,838
creating wonderful buds for next year's

389
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,680
fruit." I find it so fascinating the way

390
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,240
these instructions are going on in the

391
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:25,359
tree. And again, I think one of the the

392
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,240
themes in my life is that growing fruit

393
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,320
trees is a collaboration between the

394
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,320
grower and the tree. These trees are

395
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,240
grafted. They are not necessarily out

396
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,920
there in nature just like they are. And

397
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,079
if they are, they're not there to

398
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:40,078
produce yummy, delicious fruit. They're

399
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:42,319
just there to reproduce and drop their

400
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,319
seeds and have more trees. But we want

401
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,320
the yummy, delicious fruit. So, it's a

402
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,959
collaboration. So, we need to know when

403
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,360
to prune and how to prune to create that

404
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,198
beautiful structure. So, winter versus

405
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,120
summer pruning. I want to add an extra

406
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:59,519
little point in here. You can prune

407
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,759
until midsummer. you're in a hot

408
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,959
climate, you certainly do not want to

409
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,039
prune on the really, really hot days

410
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:09,439
because every time you make a cut on the

411
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,679
tree, you're actually creating a wound

412
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,800
and it's not protected under there. And

413
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,559
the extreme heat or extreme cold can

414
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:19,278
basically kill the cells in there

415
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,439
because they're just not protected. Um,

416
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:24,000
it's like, you know, me going out into

417
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,920
the cold without, you know, a big parker

418
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,320
on, right? I'm not protected. So, in the

419
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:33,319
same way, you you want to stop your

420
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,079
pruning at midsummer or when it gets too

421
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,600
hot. And usually we don't prune again

422
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,439
until the early spring the following

423
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,320
years. So, you think of it as a

424
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,759
spectrum. We start to prune usually just

425
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,320
before uh spring, dormcancy just before

426
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,519
spring, and we end midsummer, and then

427
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,720
we take a break. Got it. I have a juju

428
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,799
tree as well. Well, I didn't mention

429
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,800
that one and I know that one I was

430
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:58,639
advised to prune during winter time. So,

431
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,319
I went ahead and did that. I also have a

432
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,759
fig tree which was recently planted. It

433
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,199
didn't need any pruning, but I know that

434
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,838
is ideal to be wintertime before any

435
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,000
sort of sprouts happen. Now, on my lemon

436
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:12,159
tree was told that also it's it's winter

437
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,838
time is ideal before starts to flower,

438
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,558
new growth comes in. Unfortunately, I

439
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:18,798
missed that window. I uh the flower

440
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,359
started to occur on it, some new growth,

441
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,480
and then I went and pruned it. Are you

442
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,719
saying that everything is going to be

443
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,798
okay with that or has like harm been

444
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,960
done at that point since the plant has

445
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:30,558
already been flowering? No. And here's

446
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,720
the beautiful thing. First of all, I'm

447
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:33,918
not an an expert in citrus because we

448
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,440
can't really grow it here. I've had an

449
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,600
indoor lemon tree before which was

450
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,759
absolutely adorable and I loved it. Got

451
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,839
too big for our house though. I had to

452
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,000
give it away and find it a new home. But

453
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,000
here's the beautiful thing. if you're

454
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,599
making, you know, correct pruning cuts

455
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,200
with a clean pruner that's been

456
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:52,319
sanitized and sterilized. You know,

457
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,919
you're not pruning a diseased uh lemon

458
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,159
tree and then pruning your lemon tree.

459
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,640
That would spread disease. During the

460
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,679
growing season, the tree starts to heal

461
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,400
the wound pretty quickly. They create

462
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,120
cells to cover up those wounds. Now, a

463
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,600
big old branch on a big old apple tree

464
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:12,479
or whatever, that will take longer. And

465
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:15,279
that's why in the early years, that's

466
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,839
the best time to sculpt your tree to

467
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,839
create that supportive structure for

468
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,519
supporting a heavy harvest and for

469
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,639
keeping the tree open and all that

470
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:27,359
stuff. Um, because those big old

471
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,520
branches take longer to heal. But, you

472
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,918
know, little cuts like that, they will

473
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,319
heal quickly. What you don't want to do

474
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,038
is prune on a rainy day if you're in a

475
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,558
climate where there's a lot of fungal

476
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:41,119
diseases because those fungal diseases

477
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,839
spread in the on the rainy days. Um I

478
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:47,199
sadly I did I had to harvest some scion

479
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:50,240
wood for propagating my um apple trees

480
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,080
in the park. And the only time I could

481
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,558
do it cuz the buds are starting to open

482
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,720
was Saturday morning. So I go out and I

483
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,960
do it and later in the day it starts to

484
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,679
rain and I'm like oh my poor baby, my

485
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,360
poor tree. But it luckily it is a

486
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,519
disease resistant fruit tree. It's it's

487
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:08,079
resistant to some fun fungal diseases. I

488
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,079
hope it'll be okay. But the point is

489
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,399
don't prune in the rain. Don't prune on

490
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:15,038
rainy days. Keep it dry. And if you're

491
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,559
pruning close to the active growing

492
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:22,160
season, it should heal. When it won't be

493
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:23,480
good is if you prune in the fall when

494
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,038
growth has

495
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:29,038
slowed. And uh what happens is that that

496
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:31,759
it's not going to necessarily have the

497
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:34,038
energy to heal itself. You could have an

498
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:37,119
open wound all through the dormant

499
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:40,000
season. That's not ideal. Okay, good to

500
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,079
know. Now, how about pruning dead wood?

501
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,839
First of all, like I have a mixed

502
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,359
audience here. Some are beginners, some

503
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,159
don't even know what deadwood is. Could

504
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:51,279
you explain what deadwood is and then is

505
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,038
that traditionally only pruned during

506
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:55,678
wintertime for example or is that safe

507
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,679
to prune throughout just as long as not

508
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,200
wet like you mentioned? Yeah, safe to

509
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,440
prune deadwood. Deadwood is a dead

510
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,200
branch. Sometimes naturally a tree has a

511
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,440
branch that dies. Diseased wood is also

512
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,880
something that if you see certain fungal

513
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,880
diseases, it is good to do some

514
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,440
research, by the way, on the the type of

515
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,160
tree you're growing and to find out.

516
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,240
Every tree has like, let's say, five big

517
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,640
diseases that it can suffer from or

518
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,160
less. If you know how to recognize those

519
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,840
diseases, you can see them right away.

520
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,120
And often pruning out an infected

521
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:30,639
branch, putting it in a bag, getting it

522
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:35,199
off the site, don't put it in your

523
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:38,640
compost. That alone will help you get

524
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,480
rid of the disease. So you can do that

525
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,600
pretty much at any time of year. You

526
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,159
know, in that case, it's the best of two

527
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:48,240
not great choices. You could, yes, you

528
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,640
might have, if it's a disease branch, an

529
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,000
open wound, but you know, you're getting

530
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,520
rid of a pathogen correctly, getting it

531
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,159
off the site so it won't spread to your

532
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:01,038
other trees or within that tree. So, uh,

533
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:04,480
yeah, dead wood anytime because it's

534
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:06,400
dead. it's fine. Um, pretty much broken

535
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,519
branches, you know, these things can

536
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,038
cause more problems if you have a broken

537
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,200
branch. For instance, a branch that's

538
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:17,200
sort of flopping off a tree, starting to

539
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,679
rip the bark in the wind, you know, that

540
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,840
branch, a heavy branch can rip the bark

541
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,840
all the way down the tree, preventing

542
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:28,319
the tree from, you know, fully feeding

543
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:30,319
itself. um you know so that you you have

544
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,119
to sometimes you have to do these things

545
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:36,000
at at whatever time of year. Got it. You

546
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:37,519
mentioned tools to use. Can you break it

547
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,880
down for us? What are some of the best

548
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,720
tools to use for pruning? How can they

549
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,960
be sanitized? You you mentioned that

550
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,600
they should be cleanly sanitized and

551
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,200
maintained. So you start off with most

552
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,480
trees with hand pruners. You know,

553
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,360
whether you're doing citrus, whether

554
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,839
you're doing uh deciduous trees, your

555
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:58,000
hand pruners are great. you know, felos

556
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:00,319
are fantastic, but you know, there's

557
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,240
other companies that do very nice um

558
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:05,038
hand printers. So, that's for the little

559
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,759
cuts, especially when they're young, and

560
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:10,400
you'll have those. Anyways, to sanitize

561
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,158
them, all you need to do is bring some

562
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,919
rubbing alcohol. You can get them here

563
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,120
in a little sprayer, or you can put it

564
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:20,240
in a sprayer. And what I do is before I

565
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:22,239
tackle any tree, I will spray the blades

566
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,720
with rubbing alcohol and take a clean

567
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,159
clean rag and wipe it. If I'm doing a

568
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,960
whole bunch of trees, I can bring a

569
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,799
small bucket, put the blades, you know,

570
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,798
all the hand pruners or whatever in the

571
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:35,038
bucket of with like, you know, an inch

572
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,119
of alcohol at the bottom and then take

573
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:40,558
it out, wipe it with a clean rag, and

574
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:42,959
work on the tree. Nine times out of 10,

575
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:46,158
all you need to do is clean your pruners

576
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,400
before you start the first tree and do

577
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,039
that whole tree and then put them back

578
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,360
in the alcohol, go do the next tree, and

579
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:55,839
wipe them clean. So from tree to tree

580
00:22:53,359 --> 00:23:00,000
you need to clean. There is a disease

581
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:02,399
called fire blight which is nasty and

582
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,359
it's a bacterial disease and in that

583
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,480
case you need to clean your pruners and

584
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:10,639
sanitize them in between cuts. So you

585
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,120
see one fireblady branch you need to

586
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,559
remove it. You go back as far as you

587
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:18,399
can. You snip it off and then put it in

588
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:22,480
a bag. Take it off the site. Don't put

589
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,480
in your compost. and then um clean your

590
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,759
pruners again, do the next branch

591
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,519
because you could be spreading it from

592
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,319
branch to branch in the same tree.

593
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:32,960
Mostly though before a tree. Other tools

594
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:36,038
I use are loppers, those two-handed

595
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,480
tools which are great for thicker

596
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:41,599
branches. You can get extendable

597
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,839
loppers. Fiskers has a pair um that I

598
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,918
like and they help you to reach a little

599
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,639
bit higher in the tree and they can cut

600
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,640
branches up to a couple of inches thick.

601
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,720
And then the other tool, of course, I

602
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,320
have a beautiful hand saw for older

603
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,720
branches called a Silky hands saw. Silky

604
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:01,918
is the best brand. I don't have a super

605
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,319
strong upper body and Silky make goes

606
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,679
through a thick branch like butter. You

607
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,399
don't have to press, you don't have to

608
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:12,080
use muscle. You just gently, you know,

609
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:15,440
saw back and forth and it's so easy. And

610
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:17,918
then finally, I have pole pruners and

611
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,360
both of them are from Fiskers. I really

612
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:23,360
love them. I like the lighter weight one

613
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:24,879
myself, but when your tree, you know,

614
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:26,319
gets a little too big and you can't

615
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,039
reach it and you don't want to jump on a

616
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:31,918
ladder, um, you can just snip off

617
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:34,440
branches so easily using these pole

618
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,559
pruners. Now, one of them has a saw

619
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,640
attachment and I have a perfect

620
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:42,158
application for that, but I cannot

621
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:46,320
imagine myself using the saw at the end

622
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,679
of a pole. I know people do it. Um, but

623
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,158
I'm going to have to find a friend to do

624
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,240
the this the sawing with a on a pole.

625
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,240
It's just oh my gosh, how precise can

626
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,919
you be? I don't know. You probably also

627
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,839
need a lot of upper body strength. So,

628
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,520
those are the main tools that I use.

629
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:02,959
Okay, awesome. Now, you mentioned

630
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:05,440
alcohol to use to sanitize. That's

631
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,759
something that's commonly used in the

632
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,720
industry I work with as well, but a lot

633
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:10,558
of people are actually going more

634
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,640
towards bleach, a diluted bleach

635
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,440
solution. uh you know one part bleach to

636
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,120
nine parts water is very common and one

637
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,240
of the reasons why is because I actually

638
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:23,678
had somebody who's specialty in viruses

639
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,519
vyroids uh DNA RNA she came on the

640
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,960
podcast and we were talking we had a

641
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,720
conversation about this and she had

642
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,720
mentioned that with vyroids in

643
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,079
particular one of the common ones that's

644
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,519
a real scare in my industry is

645
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:37,359
hoplenyroid and we were talking about

646
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,119
sanitizing tools in order to prevent it

647
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,038
and she said alcohol actually makes it

648
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,759
worse you want to use a bleach cleaning

649
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:46,798
solution. So, I wasn't sure if that

650
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:48,879
would be the same thing with these fruit

651
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,879
trees. Not sure if you had any more

652
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,200
knowledge behind using alcohol for

653
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,278
sanitizing versus bleach. So, the

654
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,480
problem with bleach with the tools that

655
00:25:55,278 --> 00:26:01,278
I use and buy, they're not cheap. And uh

656
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,640
bleach has stuff in it and I've told I

657
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:05,359
can't remember what it's called. I've

658
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:10,159
got it actually in my book um of fruit

659
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:13,199
tree pruning. um it can um damage the

660
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,278
the blades and maybe rust the tool. I

661
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,080
can't remember what the actual problem

662
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,519
is. And I don't know about that

663
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:21,119
particular problem. I've never heard

664
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:23,359
about it with fruit trees. And one of

665
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:26,879
the things that I make it my priority is

666
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:29,678
whatever I grow, I know what the

667
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,480
potential diseases are and pests. I need

668
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,320
to know because if I don't know, I won't

669
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,960
recognize the the signs of those

670
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:39,278
problems before they occur. So, that's

671
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,440
the only reason we would do repping

672
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:44,960
alcohol. But in your industry, oh my

673
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,960
gosh, for sure, use bleach. And and your

674
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,278
tools are probably different and cheaper

675
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,038
and smaller, you know, hand pruners

676
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:54,000
maybe. Whereas if you're going to shell

677
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:56,879
out like a hundred bucks or whatever for

678
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,319
or more for a pole pruner or whatever,

679
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,000
you you just want to be a little more

680
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:01,678
careful to keep the the tool in good

681
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,919
shape. Also, I just also want to say

682
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,000
that something I really hesitated about

683
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,360
was

684
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,200
sharpening everything in fruit trees. I

685
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:11,359
hesitated. I hesitated to learn about

686
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,120
diseases. I hesitate everything. I'm the

687
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,798
kind of person that I had to do it wrong

688
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,959
until I realized, oh god, I have to do

689
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:20,400
this right because this is not working.

690
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,519
So, um, I was so scared of learning how

691
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,679
to sharpen my tools. And yet, I could

692
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:28,400
see that the tools as they get older,

693
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,120
they make these horrible, shaggy cuts

694
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,440
that the tree can't heal. And so,

695
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:35,519
sharpening is part of what we do in our

696
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,000
orchard. One of the funnest days is we

697
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:39,918
take out all our tools. We have some

698
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,079
sharpening stones. We've got some little

699
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,520
carbide tools. And everybody has fun

700
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,278
sharpening the tools. And we tell all

701
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:46,879
the neighborhood, "Hey, come out. Bring

702
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:50,159
your tools. let us sharpen the tools for

703
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,200
you because a sharp clean tool is what

704
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,840
will make a good clean cut. So, it's

705
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,000
probably the same thing, you know, for

706
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:00,158
whatever you're growing. You probably

707
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,079
also need good sharp tools. Well said.

708
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,640
Let's get a little bit deeper into

709
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,798
common tree shapes that are used when

710
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,000
you're fruit tree training. Can you talk

711
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:09,599
to us about some of the most common

712
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,359
ones? I know there's open center,

713
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,519
central leader, I think there's a few

714
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,839
more. You break it down for us. Yeah.

715
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:19,519
So, in my book for tree pruning, I talk

716
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:22,240
about the two main ones. And so, let's

717
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,000
talk about why why you even need a

718
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,839
structure. Why can't you just

719
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,839
selectively pick out this branch and

720
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:30,639
that branch? And I'll tell you a story.

721
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:32,959
I went to Virginia. I do public speaking

722
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,720
and I was talking to a group of like a

723
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,679
arborist community group or training

724
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:43,278
arborists. And before my talk, they had

725
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,600
me do a fruit tree pruning demo. So, I

726
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:47,599
go out to the

727
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:49,759
tree and I start to talk and I say,

728
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,398
"Okay, so now I'm taking my pruners and

729
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:54,640
I'm going in and I'm about to make a

730
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:56,239
cut." And I'm not just like, we call it

731
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,679
heading back, shortening a branch. I'm

732
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,240
not just shortening the branches. I'm

733
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,720
going in there on this young tree and

734
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,519
thinning out. I am cutting out a whole

735
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,120
branch right to the trunk. One of these

736
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,240
arborists looked like she was going to

737
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:13,918
jump and physically hold me back because

738
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:17,278
I was pruning out a healthy branch.

739
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,200
Totally healthy. Why is this crazy woman

740
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:22,240
removing healthy branches as an

741
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,480
arborist? You don't do that. You you

742
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,880
prune out broken branches or crossing

743
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,038
branches. You do not prune out totally

744
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,919
healthy branches, but you do that with

745
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,759
fruit tree pruning because you are

746
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,960
working to create, especially when the

747
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:39,919
tree is young, a strong fruitbearing

748
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,640
structure for your tree that has great

749
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:45,440
air circulation and that allows the

750
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:49,440
canopy to dry out so it doesn't collect

751
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:52,038
moisture and spread fungal diseases. and

752
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,440
so that sunlight gets to every single

753
00:29:52,038 --> 00:29:57,398
branch so that it can photosynthesize

754
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,720
properly, it can ripen the fruit

755
00:29:57,398 --> 00:30:03,199
properly, all that good stuff. So that's

756
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,558
why we need specific structures. It's

757
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,319
not just, oh, I got to prime my fruit

758
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:08,000
trees. I'll just snip here and snip

759
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,720
there because sometimes you could be

760
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,038
making things worse and not better. So

761
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,360
the first structure I learned was called

762
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:19,200
central leader. And that structure

763
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:21,359
became popular in the early 1900s

764
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,440
because it creates a structure where

765
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:25,719
your tree looks a little bit in a

766
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,558
triangle-shaped sort of Christmas tree

767
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:31,880
shaped, but there is a you've got

768
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:34,319
horizontal branches. We call them um

769
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,480
platforms. So the first platform of

770
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:39,200
let's say three to five branches might

771
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,720
be at my knee height. And like a

772
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,840
Christmas tree, those will be the widest

773
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,519
branches. The next platform might be at

774
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:49,278
my waist. Again, three to five branches.

775
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,359
And let's say if you want one more

776
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:53,679
platform, maybe it's at my shoulders.

777
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:55,639
Three to five branches. Each of these

778
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,720
branches is pointing in a different

779
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:02,000
direction. And each of them is chosen so

780
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,399
that it's not shading the ones below. So

781
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,679
between those each platform, you've got

782
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:11,158
like two 2 feet, let's say, of empty

783
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:14,159
space. And that allows the air

784
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,000
circulation to go through. Then you go

785
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,799
and you top your tree. So it's a

786
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,278
beautiful triangle. Imagine you take a

787
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:24,240
bamboo stick and walk around just to

788
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:25,960
shorten the branches so that the top

789
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,880
ones are not longer than the bottom

790
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,640
ones. Every time you shorten the branch,

791
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,159
it's like what we talked about earlier

792
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,440
in the show. You are allowing the energy

793
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,600
of that branch to go to fewer

794
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,278
buds. Okay? Not as long. So few more

795
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,959
energy for the remaining buds, more

796
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:45,200
chance of getting fruit depending on the

797
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,960
time of year you do it. And those

798
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,038
branches get thicker and stronger

799
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,720
because they got a little more energy.

800
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:56,240
So they can have more secondary tree

801
00:31:52,720 --> 00:32:00,240
growth, right? So So you're creating

802
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:02,319
this kind of chunky like thick little

803
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,079
branches on the top and and on the

804
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:07,599
bottom. So the branches get thicker and

805
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:10,558
stronger. Um, in 2013 we had an ice

806
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:12,639
storm here in Toronto and big trees were

807
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:14,839
falling down all over the place. Our

808
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,360
little fruit trees, not one broken

809
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:19,759
branch because we had been pruning them

810
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:21,359
for strength so they could support a

811
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,759
heavy harvest. A little bit of ice, what

812
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:26,000
do they care? They're no no problem.

813
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,398
Okay, you're creating this really lovely

814
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,720
structure for the tree by removing

815
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:33,439
healthy branches, right? You're

816
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,440
sculpting the tree. The second those

817
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,360
that's great for in my climate for

818
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:43,120
apples and any climate for apples and

819
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:45,519
pears you can grow you can grow sour

820
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,839
cherries in that in that central leader

821
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,759
format you can grow lots of things

822
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:52,158
apricots

823
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,839
um but there is another structure that

824
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:57,120
people have used since the beginning of

825
00:32:53,839 --> 00:33:00,240
time since like Roman times and that is

826
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:03,278
the more traditional vase shape it's

827
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,120
also called open center where instead of

828
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:07,519
having that Christmas tree shape with a

829
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:10,518
tall leader at the top, you know, the

830
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:14,000
tallest branch, you've got the little

831
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:14,839
trunk and then it divides up into three

832
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,159
to

833
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:21,199
five strong branches. And each of those

834
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,519
branches after about 36 in subdivides

835
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,200
into another two branches and each of

836
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,880
those two branches subdivides into

837
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,480
another two branches. So, if you're

838
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,039
looking at that from the top, it might

839
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,880
look like a bowl or a plate. You know,

840
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:35,640
you're trying to fill up the space

841
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,880
around the tree with lots of growing

842
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:41,679
area, but this is a great structure if

843
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,799
you live in a damp climate. You cannot

844
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:48,559
get better air circulation than that.

845
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:51,839
Okay? So, and sunlight penetration,

846
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:53,678
whatever, all that good stuff. So that's

847
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:55,599
awesome for there are certain types of

848
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,759
trees that like plums sometimes

849
00:33:55,599 --> 00:34:01,759
depending on the cultivar plums just

850
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:03,839
want to grow into big open bowls and

851
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:07,519
cherries sweet cherries often want to

852
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:09,119
grow into this big open center shape. So

853
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,719
um it depends on the types of tree

854
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,720
you're growing. There's a number of

855
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,480
trees in our park that we started off

856
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,918
our sweet cherries. We started off as

857
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,639
central leader with a central tall

858
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:22,000
central branch trunk and then like I

859
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,320
described to you the Christmas tree

860
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,280
shape. It didn't want it. It first it

861
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,599
got a disease on the central leader and

862
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,679
then in the end it just had these

863
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,240
swooshing branches and we said oh let's

864
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,159
just turn it into open center. So the

865
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,719
tree every tree has its own personality

866
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,919
and its own growing style and they'll

867
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:44,239
teach you yearbyear what to do. The open

868
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,480
center that you mentioned is what a lot

869
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,759
of people use for the medicinal plants.

870
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,960
They use that where you have that one

871
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,320
branch coming out and then everything

872
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,679
just kind of multiple branches coming

873
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,200
from there and it's kind of kind of

874
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,200
comes up and creates sort of an even

875
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,638
canopy is what they aim for. So

876
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,759
definitely some similarities in what

877
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,960
you're explaining. Now, as far as the

878
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,599
branch size, it reminds me of a question

879
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,679
that I wanted to ask, which was these

880
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,480
smaller branches when you're keeping

881
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:12,319
them, if flowers develop on those

882
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,838
smaller branches, is there concern to

883
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,440
like maybe do you want to remove flower

884
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:17,039
sites on the smaller branches and keep

885
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,599
them on the larger branches that maybe

886
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:21,279
can be more stronger to hold the fruit

887
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,440
or is there like a technique revolving

888
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,960
around that? That is a very interesting

889
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,039
question.

890
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,000
So if it's apple trees have spurs and

891
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:34,639
each spur will have a little cluster of

892
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:38,119
fruit and then you've got apricot trees

893
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:40,559
have spurs. So when I started to

894
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:42,240
prune, I would go in there because I had

895
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,400
learned it was these were young trees. I

896
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:46,559
had learned about shaping the trees. I

897
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,800
cut all of those off on the apricot

898
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:52,000
trees for instance. I cut off all my

899
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,440
fruit. Right? So with a spurbearing

900
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,320
tree, you selectively choose which of

901
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,679
them to keep and which to go. So for

902
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,160
instance, apricots are notorious for

903
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:07,399
having a lot of these little spurs. If

904
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:10,559
you allow each of these spurs to produce

905
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,480
fruit, there will be no room for the

906
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,679
fruit to grow to full size. You'll have

907
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,240
a bunch of squished up

908
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:20,719
hard rock hard as rock apricots.

909
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:23,279
If you take your pruners when you're

910
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:25,118
pruning this tree, and it could be with

911
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,160
with us, our apricots are big, so we do

912
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,960
summer pruning, and let's say every

913
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,960
second spur we snip off before it even

914
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,599
blossoms. We know what the spurs look

915
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,440
like, right? We've learned, and in my

916
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,160
book, uh, Fruit Tree Printing, I also

917
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,920
show you pictures of every tree has its

918
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:44,480
own character. The spurs look different

919
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,720
in each tree. So you recognize what they

920
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,400
look like and you thin them even then.

921
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:51,679
So they're not wasting energy making

922
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,039
blossoms. Or if it's later in the

923
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:54,719
season, they've already made blossoms.

924
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:57,119
That's fine. You're reducing the size of

925
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:59,118
the tree cuz it's used up that energy.

926
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,720
But you're making you're thinning the

927
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:05,200
fruit by pruning. Thinning the fruit

928
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:07,358
takes two forms. Either you do it when

929
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:10,319
you're pruning and removing entire

930
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:13,519
branches is thinning as well or cutting

931
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,519
off spurs is thinning. or you wait until

932
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:17,119
blossom or fruit lit time. Sometimes

933
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:19,519
it's easier to do when the fruitlets

934
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,200
start to form. You go out to the tree

935
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:23,519
and let's say you've got clusters of

936
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,919
five apples all over your tree and you

937
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:28,079
reduce those clusters to one or two

938
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,720
apples because you want them to be

939
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,039
quality apples, not five crummy little

940
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:35,279
apples that are hard and not fun to eat.

941
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:37,679
Understood. That makes sense. Now, this

942
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,720
next question I have might relate to

943
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:40,559
what you were just talking about with

944
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:41,759
thinning. I was advised to ask this

945
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:43,759
question. I don't really have a whole

946
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,200
lot of knowledge in regards to it, but

947
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,440
can you explain the difference between

948
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:52,159
thinning cuts and heading cuts? Yes.

949
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:56,400
Okay. So, the the terms that I learned

950
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:58,319
when I started were heading back is

951
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,480
shortening a branch. And I was like, how

952
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,480
do I even remember that? How do I

953
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,079
remember heading back is shortening? And

954
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,599
then I kind of thought, well, if the tip

955
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,079
of the branch is the head, you're

956
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,838
cutting off the head. I don't know. It

957
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,039
was just my way of remembering. So

958
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:16,799
heading back is shortening a cut.

959
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:20,320
Thinning out is removing the branch to

960
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:24,160
its origin. So thinning out would be

961
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:26,559
removing a a side branch all the way

962
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:29,039
back to the trunk of the tree. When you

963
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:31,358
are thinning out a branch with apple

964
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:34,159
trees with with most deciduous trees,

965
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:37,119
you're looking for the collar. It looks

966
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:39,319
like a little ring that is between the

967
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,920
trunk of the tree itself or the origin

968
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:44,079
branch and the new the branch that

969
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,039
you're removing and you leave the

970
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:50,000
collar. The collar is what will heal

971
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:52,159
that pruning wound. If you cut off the

972
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,159
collar, the tree has no way of healing

973
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,078
it. It doesn't have access to the cells

974
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:58,319
in there that are going to heal the

975
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,400
wound. So, you correctly do a thinning

976
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,079
out cut. So, a thinning out cut could

977
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,960
also be here. You know, I'm holding my

978
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:07,680
arm to the side horizontally. And if I

979
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,358
have a branch growing off of this big

980
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:14,759
armlike branch, and I can do a thinning

981
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:17,838
out cut, removing that little side

982
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,680
branch to its branch of origin. So, a

983
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:23,159
thinning out cut isn't just to the trunk

984
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:25,519
of the tree, it is to the branch of

985
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:27,358
origin. Heading back is shortening,

986
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:29,280
thinning out, removing the whole thing.

987
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:32,400
Okay. And then is there an easy way to

988
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,599
explain when to do which one? I know it

989
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,760
depends on the tree and and Well,

990
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,359
there's science there, too. It certainly

991
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,119
depends on the structure you're using.

992
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:43,799
And in my book, I tell you how to create

993
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:47,519
those structures, but think of it this

994
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,760
way. How can I explain this? When you

995
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,759
are thinning out, you're removing an

996
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,359
entire branch. Let's go back to what I

997
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,960
talked about about in the winter.

998
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:58,239
Um, in the winter you you've got energy

999
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,639
in the root system and it's going to

1000
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:03,199
come up into the tree and you've pruned

1001
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:05,920
off a branch. That branch is now absent.

1002
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,679
So, the energy will go to other branches

1003
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,159
and wake up those other branches and

1004
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:12,078
those other branches will get longer. If

1005
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:14,000
in the winter, however, you are heading

1006
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,440
back a branch, you're just shortening

1007
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:21,119
it. The energy from the root system will

1008
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,679
come up into that branch. But you've

1009
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,838
clipped off the head, the top of the

1010
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:29,519
branch where there are hormones called

1011
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:32,400
oxins. And oxen hormones like to

1012
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:34,960
lengthen a branch and they dominate the

1013
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,039
side buds and they say, "You guys can't

1014
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,960
you can't do anything. I'm going to

1015
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:41,440
suppress you side buds and I'm going to

1016
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,639
just get longer and longer." when you

1017
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:49,280
rem head back and remove those oxins, it

1018
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:52,799
wakes up all the buds along that branch.

1019
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:55,800
So, what happens is heading back cuts

1020
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:58,160
make your branch have lots of side

1021
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:02,280
branches. So, it can make your tree kind

1022
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:04,639
of shrubby and it can kind of ruin air

1023
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,480
circulation. Right? There's a pro and

1024
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:09,118
con. Sometimes you want to do that with

1025
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:12,240
a young tree. the heading back cuts will

1026
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:15,119
allow those branches to thin out to to

1027
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:17,118
um thicken up and get stronger. But if

1028
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,920
you've got this big old apple tree, for

1029
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,720
instance, no air circulation. It's a

1030
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,400
mess of branches and you head back all

1031
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:26,239
those branches, you're going to have

1032
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,920
even worse air circulation cuz you're

1033
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:30,239
waking up all the buds and all those

1034
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,440
messy branches inside the canopy and

1035
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:33,919
you're going to have a million more

1036
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,838
messy branches inside the canopy. But if

1037
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,358
with this big old apple tree with a

1038
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:41,199
million branches, you go in and

1039
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:43,119
strategically cut out one or two, we

1040
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,719
call them scaffold branches, a main

1041
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,680
branch that has a lot of side branches

1042
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:49,838
on it. Just one

1043
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:52,000
cut can remove the main branch, a bunch

1044
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:54,000
of side branches that is cluttering the

1045
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,280
middle of the canopy. Take it out,

1046
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,199
you've just opened it up to air

1047
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,240
circulation.

1048
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:02,559
But saying that with an old tree, a big

1049
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:05,318
old any established tree, you never want

1050
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:08,159
to cut out more than 25% of the living

1051
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:11,480
canopy. So you may have a big old apple

1052
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:14,000
tree. You may have a plan to um you

1053
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,358
know, start a new, you know, you're

1054
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,880
going to give it a structure with better

1055
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,519
air circulation. Know you're going to do

1056
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,280
that in four years. Each year you

1057
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,960
strategically make a cut. You'll

1058
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,519
probably do that with summer pruning

1059
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,679
because you want a slow growth. And then

1060
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:29,838
in four years time you have almost a new

1061
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,598
tree but that will produce better

1062
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:34,799
quality fruit because it's not wasting

1063
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,640
its energy making more branches and and

1064
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,560
supporting the existing branches that it

1065
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:40,159
has. That's interesting. Thanks for

1066
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:42,639
breaking down the science on that one.

1067
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:45,199
Now we do have a lot of indoor growers

1068
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:48,000
that tune into this podcast and they

1069
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:49,838
like to grow in small spaces and a lot

1070
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,159
are growing in containers as well. Do

1071
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:53,759
you have any advice for applying pruning

1072
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:56,639
techniques to those folks that are

1073
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,040
indoors in containers? Yeah, well,

1074
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,719
containers can work for citrus, which

1075
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:03,519
you know that's great. And you would do

1076
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:05,239
root pruning to help keep the citrus,

1077
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:08,480
whatever it is, lemon tree

1078
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:10,399
small with things like apple trees.

1079
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:14,119
There are apple tree roottocks that are

1080
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:17,358
appropriate for pots, but you think

1081
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:19,200
about I just they won't live a long time

1082
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:21,279
and they won't produce a big harvest.

1083
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,879
So, apple trees or cherry trees or

1084
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:27,440
whatever. But here's my

1085
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,440
suggestion. Do it. But but find some

1086
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,318
friends and make a community orchard in

1087
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,119
the local churchyard. It is so fun to

1088
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:38,559
grow fruit trees, to share the harvest,

1089
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:41,280
to work together, to build community, to

1090
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:44,799
have this sustainable source of local

1091
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,800
fruit is so fun. And a lot of the people

1092
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,880
in my community orchard, they live in

1093
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,519
apartment buildings. This is like their

1094
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,400
awesome fun where you can actually look

1095
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:56,400
outside your four walls and have space.

1096
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,800
We we grow it in our local park, but

1097
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,720
there's got to be somewhere. And yes, it

1098
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,680
takes organizing. In my first book,

1099
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,199
Growing Urban Orchards, I talk all about

1100
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:06,559
starting a community orchard, you'll

1101
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:09,239
learn everything that's involved,

1102
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:13,119
including to how to care for the tree

1103
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:14,719
trees. But do it. Especially now with

1104
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,480
the world going in the direction that

1105
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:19,358
it's going in. We need to have

1106
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,079
sustainable ways to grow all sorts of

1107
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:25,358
stuff. And fruit trees, you give them a

1108
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:27,680
little bit of love and they return the

1109
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:30,159
favor in abundance with like harvests

1110
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:32,159
for years to come. But it is a

1111
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:34,318
commitment. It's more of a commitment

1112
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:35,679
than a zucchini plant that you plant

1113
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:37,920
this year and throw out at the end of

1114
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:40,078
the season and compost. Yeah, it is a

1115
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,079
commitment. And like I mentioned to you

1116
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,200
before, I planted five different trees

1117
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,440
actually recently and I'm looking to

1118
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:48,480
plant four more. And I'm really excited

1119
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,240
to get this growing season going and uh

1120
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,159
get to a harvest because I can't wait to

1121
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:53,919
do that sharing with friends and family

1122
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:56,719
like you mentioned. It's just the

1123
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,400
rewarding feeling inside. I have that

1124
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:00,000
feeling with when I share my medicinal

1125
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,838
plants and my vegetables and stuff like

1126
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,358
that, but fruit trees, some of these

1127
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:04,960
things are going to have a harvest way

1128
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:06,400
beyond what I can just consume. So,

1129
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,679
being able to to share with friends,

1130
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,440
families, even neighbors. I've been

1131
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:11,199
having a couple uh neighbors that I've

1132
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,880
been in contact with. So I think it's

1133
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:15,118
going to be really really rewarding to

1134
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,599
do the sharing there. I am just I have

1135
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,880
goosebumps because one of the most

1136
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,640
beautiful parts of having the community

1137
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:26,240
orchard is the cherry harvest day which

1138
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:28,639
is early in the season and we are all so

1139
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:30,479
excited. We have a list of community

1140
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:33,440
members. People come and they bring

1141
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,039
their children and at first it was not a

1142
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,880
good experience. There were people who

1143
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:39,039
were coming with their own bags elbowing

1144
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,200
out everybody else stuffing stuff in a

1145
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:43,519
bag. It didn't feel good. Didn't feel

1146
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:46,719
right. So, one of our members said, "You

1147
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:48,880
know what? Let's do this. We have bowls.

1148
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:50,879
Everybody has to harvest into bowls."

1149
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,800
And then at the end, we may, you know,

1150
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,200
we have an hourong harvesting session.

1151
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,800
At the end, we weigh what we have. So,

1152
00:45:55,199 --> 00:46:00,000
we know, we have a record of how much

1153
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,760
the tree produced. And then everybody

1154
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,239
gets an equal share of the harvest. We

1155
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,640
just scoop it up into paper bags. It

1156
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:11,118
teaches the kids about sharing. and the

1157
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:12,960
adults. It is the most beautiful comm in

1158
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:16,480
a in a society where we're all so

1159
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:19,440
isolated. It is such a beautiful thing.

1160
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,358
Fruit trees bring so much joy. And it's

1161
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,240
not just the harvest. It's also the

1162
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:26,480
collaboration with the tree. There's not

1163
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:29,279
there's nothing like this relationship

1164
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:32,400
you have with this living organism that

1165
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,160
will live as long as we do. You know, it

1166
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,280
becomes your friend. Each one has its

1167
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:40,159
own character. you know, we it's just

1168
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,640
incredible. So, I really hope that you

1169
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:44,239
do get those experiences. One piece of

1170
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:46,799
advice that I heard from somebody and I

1171
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,639
love this advice is think carefully how

1172
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,000
many trees you're going to plant and

1173
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:54,639
make sure that you know how to care for

1174
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,280
them and you know what the commitment is

1175
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:59,759
and don't plant more than what you can

1176
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,519
care for. So, this person um sharing

1177
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,319
planted hundreds of trees. he had the

1178
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:06,440
space, but he, you know, maybe he's only

1179
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:10,079
able to do the organic sprays on

1180
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:11,440
80%. And so 20% won't get protected and

1181
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,800
they're going to have disease and that's

1182
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,519
going to be bad. So think

1183
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:19,519
carefully. All my training stuff and all

1184
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,440
most of my books talk about choosing

1185
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,039
disease resistant trees, how to choose

1186
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,679
the trees that will work together,

1187
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:28,000
what's involved in the care, just so you

1188
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:30,078
know in advance. It is not a full-time

1189
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,920
job, but you what you have to do, you

1190
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,318
have to do. Good advice. And one more

1191
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,159
piece of advice I'd like to add in if I

1192
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:37,759
can is choosing the right zone. Stuff

1193
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:39,440
that will grow in your zone. Knowing

1194
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,760
your zone and choosing the stuff that's

1195
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,800
in the right zone. I uh I had to do my

1196
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,960
research and figure out what's going to

1197
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,560
grow here because I'm in a very dry, hot

1198
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,559
climate. And there's a lot of things

1199
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,880
that will not grow here no matter what

1200
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:53,440
you try to do to it. So yeah, choosing

1201
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,200
plants that are good for your climate is

1202
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,480
super super important, specifically, you

1203
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:58,159
know, if you're growing outdoors, of

1204
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,559
course. Yesterday I just did an

1205
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:03,598
interview with um somebody in

1206
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:07,039
Mississippi, Larry Stevenson, and it's

1207
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:09,200
very damp, it's very hot, and he says

1208
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:12,400
you can go to the garden center and buy

1209
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:15,519
a red delicious apple tree. That tree,

1210
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:18,960
wrong zone, not enough chill hours, but

1211
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:23,679
they'll sell it to you, right? So, it's

1212
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:25,599
up to us to do the research. The biggest

1213
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:28,000
decision you will make that will affect

1214
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,000
the success of growing your fruit tree

1215
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,440
is choosing the right tree in the first

1216
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,440
place. So, you know, when I teach the

1217
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,960
workshop on that topic, it takes me a

1218
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,880
couple of hours. I take people through

1219
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,720
crosspollination and this and that. It's

1220
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,838
actually really fun. It's like putting

1221
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:45,279
together a puzzle, but you got to do it.

1222
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:47,119
But when you do, you're not going to

1223
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,400
have you're just taking 80% of the

1224
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,800
problems that you would have had and

1225
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,039
you're getting rid of them.

1226
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,599
Making your life so much more fun. So

1227
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:58,960
much more fun. I want to shift over and

1228
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:01,599
talk about after you prune things that

1229
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,519
you can apply to the cut in order to

1230
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,599
prevent disease. Are there any natural

1231
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:07,280
or organic treatments that you can do in

1232
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,880
that case? Yeah, in the old days when

1233
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,800
you made a pruning cut, people used to

1234
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:14,240
paint it with tar and all sorts of

1235
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,839
stuff. And then researchers and started

1236
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,759
to figure out that wait a minute the

1237
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:19,679
tree is designed to heal itself just

1238
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,000
like our you know you cut your finger it

1239
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:23,838
will heal itself but if you cut your

1240
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,119
finger and then paint tar in the cut

1241
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:26,719
you're actually going to prevent the

1242
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,920
finger from healing and you'll probably

1243
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:32,480
infect it. So take that idea throw it

1244
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:36,000
away. The one thing that we have done in

1245
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:38,159
the past is if uh my trees will have

1246
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,239
let's say canker which is sometimes it's

1247
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:42,879
disease it's oozing goop coming out of

1248
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:45,279
the trunk or the branches and in some

1249
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,880
cases usually you can cut off a whole

1250
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,519
branch and just get rid of it but it was

1251
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:53,119
on the trunk of our plum tree and we had

1252
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:55,358
to sort of carve it out with a a box

1253
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,760
cutter. Actually made a circle around

1254
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:59,759
where the canker was. We had some a

1255
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,640
sheet on the ground so we collected all

1256
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,160
the the bits of infected tissue on the

1257
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:06,558
sheet so we could take it away, not

1258
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:09,358
leave it in the soil. And then I think

1259
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:12,000
we just sprayed with garden sulfur just

1260
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:14,318
a little bit just to if there was any

1261
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,639
pathogen left or if it's an kind of open

1262
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:18,880
wound, you can do that. But most pruning

1263
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:20,078
cuts you do not have to protect. Okay,

1264
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,160
good to know. Yeah, I know there are

1265
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:24,400
various products out there and I've seen

1266
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:26,159
various videos of people putting things

1267
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,079
I don't even know what it's called. like

1268
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:29,679
this white it looks like white paint. I

1269
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,920
know it's not white paint but it's it's

1270
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:33,598
some product but it's good to hear that

1271
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,760
uh you don't have to apply any of that

1272
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,000
stuff. The trees know they've trees have

1273
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,240
evolved to to do this stuff. Now trees

1274
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,079
have evolved also to produce fruit but

1275
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:45,598
when you have a fruit tree it's a

1276
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:47,920
roottock one tree with a grafted on

1277
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:50,400
usually grafted on scion wood which is

1278
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,920
another tree. So the reason that we kind

1279
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,760
of need to work with the trees is we're

1280
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,639
cultivating it for fruit production.

1281
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:00,559
That's the importance and for health.

1282
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:03,358
But the scion wood is like any tree.

1283
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:06,160
It's it's evolved to heal itself as long

1284
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:08,639
as you make that correct pruning cut.

1285
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:10,799
And we talked about the thinning out cut

1286
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:13,519
will be just past the collar. The

1287
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:16,880
heading back cut, you need to cut just

1288
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:18,318
about a/4 of an inch past a healthy bud.

1289
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,160
And the bud has to be pointing in the

1290
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:22,599
right direction and whatever. But the

1291
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:26,879
point is, if you leave too much of a

1292
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:28,480
stub past a bud, the stub will die and

1293
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,559
then that could be an entry point for

1294
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,679
disease. So, you want to just know how

1295
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:36,319
to make your correct cuts. Got it. That

1296
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:39,199
brings me into mistakes that are often

1297
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:41,599
made. If somebody were to overp prune,

1298
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:44,239
for example, or if there was a young

1299
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:45,599
tree where they made a mistake and it

1300
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:47,439
there was a structural issue that

1301
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,160
happened, what would be your general

1302
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:52,240
recommendation for fixing those things?

1303
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:53,399
First of all, love yourself. It's okay.

1304
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:56,000
We all make

1305
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,480
mistakes. Uh certainly I have made many

1306
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,838
of them and um I have stressed about

1307
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,838
many of the pruning cuts. I don't

1308
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:03,838
anymore because I see what trees do. At

1309
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:06,078
least the trees that I work with. Second

1310
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:08,279
of all, over the years, yes, you will

1311
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:12,079
make mistakes and you will learn from

1312
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:14,880
them. Um, often what happens if if

1313
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:17,599
people overp prune, they get too much

1314
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,920
leafy growth, uh, water sprouts, which

1315
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:23,920
are these weird looking, ugly upward

1316
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:26,480
branches that don't produce fruit. Um,

1317
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:29,440
in each situation, you just need to

1318
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:32,440
learn the science and learn from your

1319
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:35,358
mistakes. So, for instance, if you overp

1320
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:37,039
pruned, you will learn, oh, why did I

1321
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:38,719
prune and my tree got bigger with a

1322
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:40,400
bunch of weird sprouts going upwards,

1323
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:41,439
and that wasn't my goal. You're going to

1324
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,920
learn the science. You're going to

1325
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,240
understand why that happened. You can't

1326
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,480
just cut off all those sprouts. They'll

1327
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:50,879
just grow back again. You think, when

1328
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,440
should I cut off the sprouts? Not in the

1329
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,920
winter, because it'll, you know, we keep

1330
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,838
talking about that cycle of energy. And

1331
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,639
in the summer, you can do it, but not

1332
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:02,960
all of them because the tree, you overp

1333
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:04,480
pruned. The tree panicked and says, "I

1334
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,039
don't have enough leaves to make energy

1335
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,280
for myself." Now, this person, this lady

1336
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:11,199
cut off too many of my branches. I don't

1337
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,680
have enough leaves. I better form a lot

1338
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:16,159
of water sprouts that go straight up to

1339
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,159
the sky to make more leaves so I can

1340
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:21,519
feed myself. So, it's just trying to

1341
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:23,358
survive. So, really learn the science.

1342
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:25,039
And once you understand the science, the

1343
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:26,239
tree is just communicating with you. you

1344
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:28,639
just listen and then do something

1345
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:30,239
different next time. Every tree is

1346
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:32,118
different. Some trees just like to

1347
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:35,519
produce water sprouts even if you prune

1348
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:37,680
them perfectly. And other ones just

1349
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:39,920
don't like some pear trees just don't

1350
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:42,480
even need a lot of pruning at all.

1351
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,960
Everyone has their own character. Would

1352
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,400
it ever make sense to like skip pruning

1353
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,000
a year? Like say you over prune

1354
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,000
something and then you go through the

1355
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,719
growing season, you get some growth that

1356
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,639
happens. Would it make sense to skip

1357
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:56,799
pruning that winter and just seeing what

1358
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:59,759
the next year growth would look like?

1359
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,359
Almost never. Okay. Um un But I would

1360
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,680
not correct the pruning in the year.

1361
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:06,400
Let's say you over pruned. Don't correct

1362
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:09,440
it that year. Um Oh, I see what you

1363
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,920
mean. If you totally overp pruned, what

1364
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:15,000
would in the winter what would happen is

1365
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:17,599
you'd have a bushy crazy looking

1366
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,318
tree. You know, over the growing season,

1367
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:23,359
whoops, I made a mistake. you are going

1368
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:25,119
to have to very slowly start reducing

1369
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:27,920
the number at the right time of year of

1370
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:30,160
those branches. So leaving it for a year

1371
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:33,079
would just be a mess. It's one of every

1372
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:36,799
year is your opportunity to reduce by

1373
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:39,359
25%. So overp pruning no. Would you ever

1374
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:42,000
skip a year to prune? I just think it's

1375
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,598
a missed opportunity. Once you create

1376
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,280
the structure for your tree, it's called

1377
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,599
formative pruning. The first, let's say

1378
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,599
3 years to 5 years of your tree, you're

1379
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:52,240
creating the structure. After that,

1380
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:54,640
there's minimal pruning and but you have

1381
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:56,479
to do it, but it's not a lot. It's

1382
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:58,078
actually not even as fun because it

1383
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,400
creating the shape is the funnest part.

1384
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,760
We we love pruning and we don't have

1385
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,119
enough pruning to do these days because

1386
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,960
our trees have such a nice shape to

1387
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:06,318
them. I really appreciate your insight

1388
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,159
there. I appreciate your insight for

1389
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:10,159
this whole episode. This has been

1390
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:11,679
fantastic. I've definitely learned a

1391
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:13,358
handful of things and I know that my

1392
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:15,039
audience has learned some things as

1393
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:16,880
well. So, thank you so much for coming

1394
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:18,239
on to the podcast today. We're going to

1395
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,920
wrap things up here. Can you tell the

1396
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:21,279
listeners how they can find you and is

1397
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,880
there anything you have upcoming in the

1398
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,440
future that you want to talk about?

1399
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:28,400
Absolutely. So, you can find me at

1400
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:31,119
orchardpeople.com and there I have

1401
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:35,280
articles. I have a monthly podcast and

1402
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:37,680
radio show and um I have some videos

1403
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,480
there too. I have a the Orchard People

1404
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:42,960
YouTube channel which also has tons of

1405
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,039
videos. Like my podcast is in video

1406
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,760
format now with lots of pictures and it

1407
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:50,000
you learn a lot every time. It's like a

1408
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:53,200
lesson in some wonderful aspect of fruit

1409
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,679
tree care. And finally, I would love to

1410
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:58,480
plug my new book called Fruit Tree

1411
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:00,719
Pruning: The Science and Art of

1412
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:04,559
Cultivating Healthy Fruit Trees. If you

1413
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:06,399
guys enjoyed this information, that book

1414
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,798
is just going to teach you everything. I

1415
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,039
took everything in here in my head and

1416
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:13,759
put it in the most digestible format

1417
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:16,639
because I really want to empower people

1418
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:19,119
to not have to rely on chemicals to have

1419
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:21,759
healthy and productive fruit trees. I

1420
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:23,798
have other books as well and of course I

1421
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,599
do online courses at

1422
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:28,318
orchardpeople.com that you may be

1423
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,240
interested in. So, thank you so much for

1424
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:32,880
having me on this show. This has been a

1425
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:34,399
lot of fun and it's been a a blessing to

1426
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,039
meet you. We'll definitely have a link

1427
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,119
to Susan's YouTube channel down in the

1428
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:40,960
description section below. And I'd love

1429
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,280
to know in the comments section, what

1430
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:44,798
way do you prune your trees? Let us

1431
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:48,200
know. Also want to give a thanks to the

1432
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:50,079
folks that support on Patreon.

1433
00:56:48,199 --> 00:56:51,679
patreon.com/mrgrowit. 100% of what is

1434
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,760
donated through Patreon goes right back

1435
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:55,358
into the podcast. The people being

1436
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,359
scrolled on the screen right now are in

1437
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:59,199
the producer tier. Special thanks to you

1438

again, thanks so much for coming on.

1440
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:04,960
This has been awesome. I learned so much

1441
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:07,119
