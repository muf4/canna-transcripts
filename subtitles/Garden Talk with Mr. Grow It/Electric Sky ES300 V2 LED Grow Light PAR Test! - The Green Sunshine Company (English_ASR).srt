grow light over to me and in this video

9
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:21,480
I'm going to test the power output I did

10
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,608
do a part test for the es 300 v1 if

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,289
you're looking for that video I will put

12
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,359
a card in the top right corner of the

13
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,340
screen right now and also posted in the

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,779
outro card of this video they've also

15
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,579
provided me a discount code for my

16
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:34,558
viewers so you can get a percentage off

17
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,219
a plus free shipping depending on what

18
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:36,718
country you live in

19
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,460
I will provide a link to this girl light

20
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,469
in the description section below along

21
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,049
with the discount code for the power

22
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,660
test I'm gonna use the apogee MQ 500

23
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:48,599
power meter this meter measures from 389

24
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:50,729
nanometers to 692 nanometers plus or

25
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,660
minus 5 nanometers and measurements are

26
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:53,819
in ppfd

27
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,049
and really this video is just to give

28
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,789
you a general idea of what the power

29
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:58,589
output is it's not going to be hundred

30
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,789
percent accurate I do have this girl

31
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,739
light and they grow 10 which has a

32
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,079
reflective walls that could increase the

33
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:05,879
numbers so just keep that in mind the

34
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,739
coverage area for this grow light is 2

35
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:10,079
foot by 4 foot they say that you can

36
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:12,149
extend it to two and a half feet by five

37
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,859
feet but I do have this in a two foot by

38
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,780
four foot grow tent and that's what I'll

39
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:17,670
be taking measurements in for this video

40
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,530
just like all the other part test videos

41
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,100
that I do I'll let the measurements do

42
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,079
the talking
