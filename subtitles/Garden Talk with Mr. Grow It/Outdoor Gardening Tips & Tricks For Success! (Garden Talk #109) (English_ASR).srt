and tricks for Success so I've had a few

50
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,780
people request more outdoor gardening

51
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm mostly an indoor Gardener so I

52
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,799
prefer yeah I mostly focus on that but I

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,200
do have a small outdoor Garden where I

54
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,299
grow vegetables but before we get too

55
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,618
deep into outdoor gardening can you tell

56
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,960
us a little bit about yourself and how

57
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:06,780
you got into gardening yeah I'd love to

58
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:10,199
you my name is Cassie I am going to be

59
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,900
29 this year I live out in Oklahoma and

60
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:16,019
I own my little farmhouse in three acres

61
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,480
I have one child I've been growing or

62
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,580
gardening for about two and a half years

63
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,738
so I'm still fairly new but I've really

64
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,879
learned a lot in this short amount of

65
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,659
time

66
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:29,818
um yeah these plants have really really

67
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:32,579
helped me a lot overcome a lot of

68
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:36,119
anxiety and depression and I went

69
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:39,239
through postpartum depression and just a

70
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,099
lot of General Life haste so I am super

71
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,319
in love with it and I'm really excited

72
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:46,259
to share it with everybody listening

73
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:48,299
nice nice I know you from I think I

74
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:51,000
found you on Instagram first you have a

75
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,700
pretty big Instagram page do a lot of

76
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,680
skits like funny skits I like that it

77
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,378
was really uh definitely entertaining

78
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,420
so let's get into outdoor growing the

79
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:02,399
first question I have is when you are

80
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:05,399
outdoor growing how do you determine

81
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,500
like a good spot to plant your plants

82
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,200
um well I think first things first when

83
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,479
I when I first started I really need to

84
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:15,060
know what you're working with like in

85
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,759
Oklahoma we have a lot of red clay or

86
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,340
like red dirt and Clay mixture and not a

87
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,658
lot of like abundance in the nutrient

88
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,800
Department

89
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:25,199
um

90
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,640
so with that being said I think the

91
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,738
first thing you need to do is get your

92
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,059
hand in the dirt in the soil where you

93
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,039
think you're going to be growing and

94
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,900
feel it out look for everything that you

95
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:36,840
need to be looking for richness the

96
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,120
color how wet is it already if it's dry

97
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,739
if it's rock solid

98
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,039
um you've got to assess that situation

99
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,599
but you also need to look at like how

100
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:49,318
much sunlight you're going to get in

101
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:52,560
that particular area in in like shade

102
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:54,539
um our plants are like sun prominent

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,860
plants we need the most Sun that they

104
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:56,459
can get

105
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,640
um

106
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:02,400
so yeah I just really feel around and I

107
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,139
check out my what my Daylight's like in

108
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,420
the middle of summer and every stage

109
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:09,539
spring summer and

110
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:12,000
um yeah that's really it really soil and

111
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:14,579
sunlight is going to be your two best

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,220
friends so I know you grow medicinal

113
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,439
plants just like me but you also grow

114
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,900
some other type of plants so what do you

115
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:25,259
typically like to grow outdoors

116
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:28,019
well we're working on like Food Forest

117
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:31,199
so we have a lot of fruit trees and we

118
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:32,879
we ordered those in as cuttings and we

119
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,600
planted them so I think we're going on

120
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:40,978
year three for those and um our Carolina

121
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,660
Peach Tree just went crazy last year it

122
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:44,879
was such a beautiful sight we're not

123
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,520
into fruiting yet but I'm hoping this

124
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,339
season will bring fruit Bountiful fruits

125
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,639
and um so I really enjoy watching the

126
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:55,859
trees grow and they operate kind of like

127
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:59,160
our medicinal plants like you still have

128
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,080
to prune them and you can train them to

129
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,820
like if you don't want your trees to be

130
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,219
super tall to climb a ladder you can

131
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:08,639
hang weights on their branches and train

132
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,800
them down so it's easier for picking and

133
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,418
you take off the dead leap so I really

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,540
like the trees but I also really like

135
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:18,299
comfrey and that

136
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,300
chef's kiss of a plant it is so

137
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,639
wonderful you can you can chop and drop

138
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,020
it and let it replenish the soil it has

139
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:30,720
a ton of NPK and even Trace um

140
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:32,459
nutrients in it or you can take that and

141
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,160
you can put it in a bunch of water and

142
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:37,138
you can make comfrey tea and this is the

143
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,660
coolest part you can grow your own

144
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:43,500
fertilizer to grow your own food and I

145
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,439
think that is so rad and uh yeah I think

146
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,478
comfrey is probably my my favorite

147
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:51,060
that's awesome now do you grow just in

148
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,519
the ground or do you grown containers or

149
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,500
do you follow like a raised bed how do

150
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,719
you do it

151
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,339
so last year

152
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,500
I think it was last year it might have

153
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:03,359
been the year before

154
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,819
we killed off

155
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,620
oh I'm so bad with measurements a ton of

156
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:10,019
our front yard grass it's Johnson grass

157
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,418
we killed it off with cardboard and we

158
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:15,299
basically tried the lasagna method and

159
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:17,099
I'm sure you probably know what that is

160
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,139
but if anybody doesn't it's where you're

161
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,360
stacking carbon and greens on top of

162
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,379
each other and you're not tilling into

163
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,660
the ground

164
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:27,620
so you're just basically creating this

165
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,720
really beautiful like

166
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,459
I have compost composted area to where

167
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,280
you can plant directly in instead of

168
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:38,519
just digging into the actual ground and

169
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:43,019
we did that so that's where I like to

170
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:46,019
plant last season I also did have

171
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:48,000
I think it was like a 10 gallon air

172
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:51,659
bottom bag outside and that was a huge

173
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,759
mistake that thing is extremely porous

174
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:59,580
so my plants dried out almost instantly

175
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,379
and uh it's really not my cup of tea but

176
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:04,379
I have all this space outside so I'm

177
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:06,839
gonna utilize that first if I were to go

178
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:10,079
back into pots it would be used purely

179
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:13,879
for Aesthetics and I think I'd use like

180
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:17,879
an old Barrel container instead of super

181
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:20,639
mesh breathable container so yeah into

182
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:23,219
the ground it's better got it now

183
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,038
preparing the soil for planting right so

184
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,080
I'm not sure like what seasons you are

185
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:30,240
typically growing I assume it gets cold

186
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:34,139
and you don't really grow much in the

187
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,538
winter time so like before you plant for

188
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,900
the season how do you prepare that soil

189
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:42,060
for planting so uh

190
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,978
that's good so like the Lasagna method

191
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,598
is a really good method to use for

192
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:48,659
preparing your soil but

193
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:51,300
like here for instance I have livestock

194
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,860
so I have two horses and I have two cows

195
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,220
that have pigs

196
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,319
we have chicks now but they used to roam

197
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,819
around and just poop everywhere I know

198
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,379
that sounds gross but it's really good

199
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:04,680
for the lawn

200
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:08,219
um so composting composting is huge

201
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,780
whether it be your food scraps or

202
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,660
livestock and if you don't have

203
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:14,459
livestock I'm sure there are some around

204
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,080
so go ask your neighbors if they want to

205
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:19,560
give if they want to give you free poop

206
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:21,598
it'll be super worth it so

207
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,939
um composting is huge and

208
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,740
last year we did the lasagna method and

209
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:27,899
we still have that and you don't have to

210
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,478
redo that every year which I think is

211
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:32,639
brilliant it just stays and you can

212
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,740
build on top of that as you go however

213
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,139
we are moving things to the back so this

214
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,440
year we have our compost it's been

215
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:42,479
cooking for two seasons now just keep

216
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,020
adding to it and turning it

217
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:49,080
but this year we've already got it ready

218
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:51,419
we actually have six garden rows out

219
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,778
back we did a roto till the top layer

220
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:56,399
and we brought our compost over and put

221
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:58,500
it on top so that all of the nutrients

222
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,120
can kind of set and it's rained a

223
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,940
handful of times already since doing

224
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,580
that and I think that's a really

225
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,339
beneficial way to prepare your soils

226
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:10,800
cool so another thing that people often

227
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:13,320
do is cover crops sometimes people do it

228
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,899
before they do planting some people do

229
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,260
cover crops along with their plants do

230
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:22,500
you do cover crops at all or no

231
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:23,458
um I didn't do many cover crops last

232
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,740
year

233
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:28,079
actually didn't learn about cover crops

234
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,839
until last year so I was kind of just

235
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,200
free winging it minus like

236
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:37,200
well we'll get into that I'm sure but

237
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,860
our biggest cover crop here is nitrogen

238
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:44,220
we we just kind of let a ton of or I'm

239
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:47,220
sorry of clover we let a ton of clover

240
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,560
white clover seed just all over the farm

241
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,019
so now we have Clover popping up

242
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:54,059
everywhere and wouldn't you know it it's

243
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:57,240
in places that really really need help

244
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:59,819
like super need help but

245
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,039
cover crop or Clover is the only cover

246
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:05,220
Cropper they really utilized besides

247
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:07,319
comfrey and comfrey can also be used as

248
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,959
a cover crop because it has such a wide

249
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,540
span of its leaves and it'll cover a ton

250
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:15,119
of distance if you plant it accordingly

251
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:17,278
anywhere you need it so I think that

252
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,740
those two are really the only things we

253
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,600
utilized last year okay and then another

254
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,820
thing that kind of goes hand in hand

255
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,920
with cover crops a lot of people will do

256
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,200
a mulch layer do you do any like wood

257
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,620
chips a barley straw or any type of

258
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:35,700
mulch yeah so

259
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:37,620
um we have a ton of excess hay from our

260
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,320
livestock we have grass Haze and we have

261
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,899
Alfalfa and I know a lot of people use

262
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,200
like the Alfalfa meals which is super

263
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:49,440
beneficial for your soils it's so so

264
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,420
great for your plants but even just in

265
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,240
whole form alfalfa

266
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:57,379
that's been used in the lasagna method

267
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,560
and it it is the most top layer but

268
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:03,539
besides that we also contacted our local

269
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,338
electrical company and they do have to

270
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:07,799
trim down a lot of trees to get to their

271
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:11,040
power lines and they always want a place

272
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:13,199
to dump so we had them haul their giant

273
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,059
truckload over to our house and just

274
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,200
dump it and then we took it and we

275
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:21,599
spread it across the lasagna garden and

276
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,879
so yeah it's really super wonderful for

277
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,100
water retention I think that's

278
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:28,620
obviously there is nutrients that you

279
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,480
can get from these these volts layers

280
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,620
but water retention is really big like

281
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,139
we get so hot and dry out here in

282
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,240
Oklahoma in the first part of like

283
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:41,759
spring and summer and then it's just

284
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,500
humid but it has been really helpful for

285
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,078
watering because

286
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,419
we're all human and we do all water

287
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,559
every day

288
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:51,479
that sounds like it could be beneficial

289
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:53,159
for you yeah I was going to ask you what

290
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,778
fertilizer you use and how you go about

291
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:56,100
feedings but it sounds like from

292
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:57,539
everything you've explained so far that

293
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,980
you have like a closed loop operation

294
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:01,139
going there where you're just basically

295
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,820
using your own inputs from your land so

296
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:04,740
you're not buying any like synthetic

297
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,540
fertilizers or going out by any or

298
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,180
organic fertilizers or anything is that

299
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:11,599
right yeah this is a great question so I

300
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:11,599
was like oh my God

301
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,959
and well it turns out when you have a

302
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:22,078
perfect environment you don't have to

303
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:24,719
and all of your nutrients your macro and

304
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:27,599
your micronutrients are already in this

305
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,899
composted materials and manures and

306
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,120
already in some grape soil but we ran

307
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,039
the Clover last year and I know that put

308
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,159
a lot of inputs into

309
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,078
our soils too so no I haven't had to use

310
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,439
any fertilizers no synthetics outside

311
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,599
I'm a big go green Advocate

312
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,240
um I do for the record use synthetics

313
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,980
indoors because I like I like to do it

314
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,759
all

315
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,879
um

316
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:57,019
but no the only thing we did was try out

317
00:12:53,879 --> 00:13:01,620
the comfrey tea last year and it was

318
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:04,799
amazing plants just went absolutely

319
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,720
Bonkers over it I do want to just add in

320
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,759
if you are going to try out a comfrey

321
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,560
tea it can get a little bit hot do you

322
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:13,919
need to dilute that to like

323
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:16,559
15 to 1 is a good ratio

324
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,299
and um

325
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:21,958
I wouldn't recommend using it on

326
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:25,500
seedlings so just be aware of that

327
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:27,359
yeah so not much food keep it pretty

328
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,958
easy there now some people add in like

329
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,519
sugars like molasses or honey do you do

330
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,679
any of that and also microbial

331
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,078
inoculants like I know you've got plenty

332
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:39,299
of diverse microbes in your backyard but

333
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:41,638
do you buy any micro products and you

334
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:44,120
can use them Outdoors or no I've only

335
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,120
used micro

336
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:49,639
microbe

337
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,639
products indoors

338
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,958
like when I mean I've seen it do some

339
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,459
wondrous things to the root Zone like

340
00:13:54,958 --> 00:14:01,799
absolutely wild but no not Outdoors

341
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:03,958
we're really big on sustainability and

342
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:06,000
like

343
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,078
um we're working on regenerative farming

344
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,179
and those things kind of just like

345
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:11,759
really go hand in hand but also part of

346
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:12,958
like being sustainable is not spending

347
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,559
your money

348
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:19,319
and that really goes into it so no and I

349
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,399
figured with all of the fruit trees and

350
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,500
the bigger trees because we're

351
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,778
surrounded by pretty decent little

352
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,500
Forest out here in Oklahoma that there

353
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:28,860
was

354
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,419
plenty of mycorrhizae and all of that in

355
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,480
the ground already so I haven't really

356
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:36,479
found a need to add into it yet

357
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,539
um but as far as like your molasses your

358
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:43,199
molasses I'm super not opposed to that

359
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:45,360
as like teas like boosts

360
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,278
um so that may be something I would like

361
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,339
to try in the future I actually like

362
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:53,179
lift up like how do you make molasses

363
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:53,180
can I do that at home

364
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:58,079
I don't think so

365
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,360
yeah people do commonly use them in you

366
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,578
know compost teas as a food source have

367
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:06,419
you done any compost teas and use them

368
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:09,659
Outdoors or no I haven't really I just I

369
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:12,958
haven't had the need to like last year

370
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:14,240
last season I had 11 foot Christmas

371
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:19,018
trees

372
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:21,959
uh and they flourished and um I just I I

373
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:25,440
didn't find a need to yet but I may be

374
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:27,659
may this year it makes sense so growing

375
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,600
Outdoors is there's a lot of differences

376
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:32,278
between growing indoors and Outdoors one

377
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,680
of the things that you're more at risk

378
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:35,820
for outdoors is pests you know they're

379
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:37,679
all over the place it's a whole

380
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,620
different Battlefield what do you

381
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,259
typically do to prevent pests I want to

382
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:47,039
laugh at prevent

383
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:49,679
I have learned I have learned to be more

384
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,778
proactive than reactive especially

385
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,778
outside

386
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:56,338
um Oklahoma has

387
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:59,039
literally every pest you could possibly

388
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:01,740
think of so

389
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:04,679
last year I wasn't really great at

390
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,299
preventing I was more reactive and I

391
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:08,219
would spray

392
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:12,179
um last year I tried out crop Defender

393
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:14,579
by Petra tools and it did okay it was

394
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,958
really light application and it seemed

395
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:17,638
to do like the trick but the thing with

396
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,500
that is like you really had to keep

397
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,360
applying that to to notice a difference

398
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,958
and

399
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,959
um something that I would really like to

400
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:30,119
Advocate is like make sure that your

401
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,859
soils are extremely healthy and your

402
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,419
plants are extremely healthy when you're

403
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:37,139
growing outside that's going to give

404
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:39,659
them the best chance at survival to use

405
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:41,940
their natural defenses

406
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:43,980
um but something that I will be

407
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:47,519
utilizing this year

408
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,680
is um like with companion planting so

409
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,560
like there's tons of plants like

410
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:54,120
Rosemary mint are really at the top of

411
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,819
my list because they'll actually just

412
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,360
deter and repel plants or I'm sorry

413
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:02,639
pests they don't like the smell it's too

414
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,338
stinky in Lavender is also in that

415
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,279
category and then you also have like

416
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:11,578
companion plants like marigolds and

417
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:14,099
they'll actually like lure in the pests

418
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:16,139
and keep them well maybe probably not

419
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:18,779
all of them but keep them more

420
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:21,720
interested in them versus the medicinal

421
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:24,298
plants and I think that is just so

422
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,699
wonderful and a we get to avoid spraying

423
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:28,980
anything on our our crops but especially

424
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:32,940
when we get into flour that's always

425
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:34,798
been extremely scary to me like ah I

426
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:39,298
don't want to spray anything on them and

427
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:40,980
then you you run into to boisterous and

428
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:43,500
chemicals that you could potentially

429
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,900
been be inhaling and like we don't want

430
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,599
that we don't want that outside at all

431
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,940
so I think utilizing companion plants

432
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:52,500
will be my best route this year for sure

433
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,538
that's something I'm gonna have to step

434
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,700
my game up uh my outdoor Garden I just

435
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:59,759
have a small I mean I'm in Las Vegas and

436
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,980
our backyards are so tiny and I just

437
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,440
have a two foot by 10 foot bed raised

438
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,620
bed and so um usually I grow some

439
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,298
lettuce bok choy kale Peppers I've got

440
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:11,579
some melons but I don't have any

441
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:13,139
companion plants out there so I really

442
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:15,298
think I'm gonna step it up this year

443
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,340
have some Rosemary and lavender and

444
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:19,740
maybe a few other things in there as

445
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:22,500
well to help on that Avenue to help

446
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,319
deter pests I had aphids one year which

447
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,119
was a freaking nightmare I was so not

448
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:29,700
like heartbreak seeing those things just

449
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,439
all over your plants and uh yeah so it'd

450
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,200
be good to not deal with that in the

451
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,900
future I think it's fantastic that

452
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,480
you're still utilizing the space that

453
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:42,360
you have even if it is small there's so

454
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:45,058
many people I I've run into like I don't

455
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:47,579
have this face I'll let you do you can

456
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:50,279
do anything like get yourself window

457
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:52,980
herbs or or do what you're doing just a

458
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:55,558
little raised bed box outside

459
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,200
start small and it'll progress I promise

460
00:18:55,558 --> 00:19:01,558
but you can you can utilize all your

461
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,140
spaces you just have to want to yeah I

462
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,940
mean I'm even trying to cram in a

463
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,000
compost pile on my own door but like I

464
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:11,400
have my whole yard is basically Rock You

465
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,679
know it's just it's not moist I'm in the

466
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,960
desert you know so it's like there's no

467
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,200
earthworms out here at least in my

468
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,519
backyard is just so dry but I'm trying

469
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,019
to make space I'm gonna rake some of

470
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:23,579
those rocks away and then and then start

471
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:25,440
composting out back because that's

472
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:27,480
another important part of kind of

473
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,340
outdoor growing close loop operations

474
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,500
all that stuff which you had mentioned

475
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:34,079
that you do compost it's extremely

476
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,000
beneficial it's good for your plants and

477
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,619
it's good for the environment I mean if

478
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,940
you can take all of those food scraps

479
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:41,279
instead of throwing them away and

480
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,200
reutilize them you're doing your part

481
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,660
you're helping so much more than you

482
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,340
think you are so good that's exciting

483
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,558
stuff yeah I do want to get into

484
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:52,079
composting a little bit deeper but first

485
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:54,960
I want to stick on the topic of pests

486
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,819
for a minute have you had any major pest

487
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,500
info infestations that you could talk

488
00:19:56,819 --> 00:20:03,079
about if so like how did you battle them

489
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:07,259
it's a battle I lost

490
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:10,678
it's gonna be straight up

491
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:14,038
um caterpillars were the demise of my 11

492
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,240
foot Christmas trees last year

493
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:17,579
um

494
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,259
I I couldn't really battle them because

495
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:21,720
I they were super pronounced during

496
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:24,179
flower which is the stage they really

497
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,038
like and what they'll do is they'll go

498
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,980
into your plants and of course eat the

499
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:32,759
foliage but they'll also

500
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:34,380
poop in the buds and a lot of Growers

501
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:35,940
don't realize that's happened until

502
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,039
they're at Harvest and the buds will

503
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:42,779
literally just fall apart but that'll

504
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:45,419
also cause Bud rot ultimately so

505
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:47,038
I'm really health conscious so as soon

506
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:48,480
as I started seeing the bugs and even

507
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,700
like one

508
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,120
portion of Bedrock I kind of was like

509
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:56,340
this is probably gonna be it for me I'm

510
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,479
not gonna smoke this but I I wanted to

511
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:00,058
see and

512
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,900
with the humidity and those caterpillars

513
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:03,119
and

514
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,038
everything else that was out there I I

515
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,079
just chopped them and I got rid of them

516
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:11,099
it wasn't worth it to me to even

517
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:13,319
potentially smoke something hazardous so

518
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:15,480
I just got rid of them but I am really

519
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:16,200
super open to

520
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,140
um

521
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,538
whatever IPM regimens that people are

522
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,580
doing in flower I haven't really found a

523
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:25,440
whole lot of information you know

524
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:27,538
there's only there's so much more

525
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,940
information now than there even was just

526
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:32,339
a few years ago but I'm really open to

527
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:35,519
suggestions for the outdoor grows

528
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:37,918
because that really totally kicked me in

529
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,480
the behind last year yeah I haven't come

530
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,980
across caterpillars but I've heard about

531
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,900
them being a nightmare I was going to

532
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,759
ask you if you knew of a way to get rid

533
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,140
of them like if there's this particular

534
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:48,298
spray or if there's any of those

535
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,940
companion plants that you use that deter

536
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:52,440
them or what yeah I'm sure that

537
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,840
companion plants will come in super

538
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,279
handy and I can almost guarantee that

539
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:59,459
they'll be attracted to things like the

540
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:02,579
marigolds but I've also been told to use

541
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:05,159
capsaicin a capsaicin mixture with water

542
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:08,819
and that will just absolutely annihilate

543
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:10,440
them them and many other pests but I

544
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:13,740
also want to add if you are going to do

545
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,919
that do it downwind and cover your eyes

546
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:19,319
be very careful

547
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:22,080
yeah I've heard that that the capsaicin

548
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:25,619
will just like basically dry them out

549
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:27,779
suffocate them in their toast and um

550
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:29,399
yeah that's all fine and dandy but then

551
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:31,879
what happens when you get to flower I

552
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,259
don't want to smoke spicy

553
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,460
you know I have so many questions about

554
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:38,099
flower

555
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,319
so what other problems do you come

556
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:42,058
across when growing Outdoors anything

557
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:47,399
else come to mind for you

558
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:51,298
yeah sure uh humidity humidity is

559
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:53,940
a beast within itself especially out

560
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:57,599
here in Oklahoma we literally sit in

561
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:01,200
like 75 to 90 percent humidity when we

562
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:03,538
get into summer and it's awful because

563
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,659
when you get into late summer you're

564
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:08,819
showing signs of flour and you're kind

565
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:11,280
of at a standpoint so some of the things

566
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:14,519
that I could recommend to kind of like

567
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:17,399
counter humidity is

568
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:20,038
go outside right as the sun is rising

569
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,900
and shake off any morning dew in your

570
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:24,658
plant so it doesn't have time to sit

571
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,460
there and absorb especially again in

572
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:30,000
flour

573
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:33,538
um and I mean how do you battle

574
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,819
outdoor moisture be really careful when

575
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:38,038
you are using IPM like make sure you're

576
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:40,500
really trying to utilize that in

577
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:42,179
vegetative state and also be really

578
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,038
careful when you're watering so like

579
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:46,798
don't just go out there spray in your

580
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:48,419
whole plant down trying to cool it all

581
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,099
cool it off because that will just

582
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:51,720
absolutely backfire make sure you're

583
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:54,599
watering at the base and really trying

584
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,860
to to avoid the foliage if you can you

585
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,859
know

586
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:57,859
um

587
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:04,259
I don't think it would be crazy to

588
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:07,139
actually train my plants this season and

589
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:09,179
get them at maybe a little bit shorter

590
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,299
height for me I'm five foot two 11 foot

591
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:13,980
plants that was challenged last year

592
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:16,859
but like training them down and even

593
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,460
using like cattle panel and

594
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:20,579
um

595
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,620
uh shaped cloths since it'll still allow

596
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:25,918
the scent of penetrate just take off

597
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:27,479
like a few percentages of the UV and

598
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,460
even getting maybe like an industrial

599
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,860
fan outside

600
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,419
and just giving them some extra airflow

601
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:34,619
I think that could really super be

602
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:36,659
beneficial

603
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:38,519
it's like contemporary Greenhouse cloth

604
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:41,039
house I'm curious for those 11 foot

605
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:43,200
plants I mean that's massive what was

606
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:46,079
your yield for that did you measure it

607
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,058
no because I had to chop them down oh

608
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:51,058
okay yeah it's easy to actually get any

609
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:53,519
of them to harvest uh no I did not want

610
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:56,399
to risk it and it was absolutely dead

611
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,319
yeah I'm hanging my head

612
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,019
it was

613
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,519
it was really seriously sad I hope you

614
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:05,579
have better luck this year on that

615
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:07,319
Avenue have you had any outdoor harvests

616
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:08,699
I was going to ask you about like you

617
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:10,500
know there's a lot of controversy about

618
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,558
a lot of debate about indoor versus

619
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,298
outdoor and the flavor profile it was I

620
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:16,918
wonder if you had an opinion on uh if

621
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:18,900
you feel like the outdoor Sun grown

622
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:21,600
results in about a terpene profile

623
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:24,120
better flavor compared to indoor or not

624
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:27,259
um I

625
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:30,239
it's so hard to say because

626
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:33,000
girls who have a really really fire

627
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,220
indoor product like things that straight

628
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,480
up smell like fruit

629
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:41,640
like like not flower fruit

630
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,700
and it just absolutely blows my brain

631
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,620
like incredible and outside I know you

632
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,100
can't beat the Sun but there's so many

633
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:51,298
other factors that go into it like

634
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:54,000
environmental like what are you around

635
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:56,579
what kind of sense is this plant gonna

636
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,298
pick up how's the pollution in your area

637
00:25:56,579 --> 00:26:03,839
like I think it all plays a part in in

638
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:06,359
sticking to these romantic oils you know

639
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:09,139
like I'm thinking fairies I think the

640
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:12,298
sun is a really powerful and beautiful

641
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:14,700
tool but I think that we've come really

642
00:26:12,298 --> 00:26:17,220
far in replicating that in such a

643
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:21,720
cleaner environment and donors so I

644
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:23,819
don't know I'm pretty 50 50 y'all yeah I

645
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,220
feel like I'm the same way I've grown a

646
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:28,079
lot of fire indoor I've certainly

647
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,360
consumed a lot of Outdoors well over the

648
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,759
years but I don't personally grow

649
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:34,740
medicinal plants Outdoors so at least

650
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:36,359
right now I don't I'm not able to am I

651
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,980
stated does it allow it unfortunately

652
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:40,019
hopefully that'll change sometime in the

653
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,759
future but as of right now I can't I

654
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:43,679
would love to grow some medicinal plants

655
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,099
outside but yeah I'm not going to uh

656
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,960
pick and choose indoor versus outdoor

657
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:51,538
yeah yeah that's it's a hard hard

658
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,778
question and we know so many people that

659
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:56,879
rock both of them so it's like

660
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:58,440
I don't want to say who's better

661
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,299
um

662
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,659
I thought this is the biggest wreck you

663
00:27:00,298 --> 00:27:06,058
just can't grow yeah Vegas's wreck it's

664
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:08,700
uh basically you have to if you're over

665
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:11,639
25 miles away from a dispensary then you

666
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,200
can grow home grow up to six plants now

667
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,500
if you have a medical card that's when

668
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,600
you're able to grow up to 12 plants as

669
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,980
long as a cultivar that's you need for

670
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:21,899
your medical condition isn't available

671
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,298
in local dispensary so that's kind of

672
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:26,700
the the loophole that they have here and

673
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:27,900
I'm fairly sure that there's no outdoor

674
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,640
growing like it's not supposed to be

675
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,038
outdoors at all like of course not

676
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,538
visible and so on and so forth backyards

677
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:35,700
are so small like I mentioned that

678
00:27:33,538 --> 00:27:38,158
neighbors can easily just look over and

679
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,259
see your entire backyard so in most

680
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,120
places very rare to find a private

681
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:43,859
backyard unless you're a millionaire and

682
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:45,658
you've got if you've got tons of money

683
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:47,158
you can buy a huge you know private land

684
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:49,740
in the backyard and stuff like that but

685
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:52,080
uh that's crazy they really really

686
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,839
bubble that around dispenser you send

687
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:56,220
their profits that's crazy they want

688
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:59,519
money they want the money they want the

689
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:02,278
tax rate right yeah that's not basically

690
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:04,319
all right so I do want to get deeper

691
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:06,119
into planned training I know you kind of

692
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,339
touched upon it oh you said you wished

693
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:10,259
you did more plant training what do you

694
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:13,439
typically do for plant training when you

695
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:15,778
grow outdoors just the same like I keep

696
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,880
my my plants really clean

697
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:21,119
um at first I was pretty scared to like

698
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,679
remove any foliage or any branches just

699
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,859
because that's an open wound in your

700
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:26,659
plant giving pests literally front gate

701
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:29,759
access

702
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:32,580
to inside your plants but

703
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,960
um I had aloe plant outside so anytime I

704
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:36,418
pruned or

705
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,340
defoliated or anything I would always

706
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:40,380
rub

707
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:42,599
aloe on those open wounds and kind of

708
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,460
like help it heal up it also creates a

709
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:47,158
barrier between the pests and the plant

710
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,860
and it it seemed to work out really well

711
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:52,500
I never had any like

712
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:54,479
um you'll probably know there's a pest

713
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:58,558
that'll like burrow itself is it called

714
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,599
a burrow inside your plant stem and like

715
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,700
get into your plant and absolutely

716
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:05,278
destroyed it so I was like super scared

717
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,558
of that so having that was great and I

718
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:10,319
didn't really do much training outdoors

719
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:12,500
I really wanted to see a medicinal plant

720
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:16,319
in its full State because I haven't

721
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:19,980
gotten to in in firsthand I've seen on

722
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:22,079
TV and on on the YouTubes

723
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:25,679
um but yeah I didn't really train I

724
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:28,859
usually LSD and I do I have done trellis

725
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,538
training or trellis net indoors but

726
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:34,619
I just wanted to see a really really

727
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:37,019
giant plants so I got what I got

728
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:39,658
um this year like I said I would really

729
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:43,440
like to utilize more training to keep

730
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:45,240
them you know closer to height just

731
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,179
easily

732
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:52,079
touchable I had to look a gigantic

733
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:54,480
ladder around outside and it was fun

734
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,460
being up there but really just big old

735
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,339
pain

736
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:01,919
um so probably some LSD probably do some

737
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:03,839
Stakes of ground stakes and have places

738
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,179
to tie them off to

739
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,398
it's the same old same old as indoors

740
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,600
just bigger

741
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:13,199
sweet I want to Circle back to

742
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:15,359
composting now I myself have a Verma

743
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,700
compost bin so I've been utilizing I

744
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:19,558
have a small bin indoor in my garage I

745
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,419
got some worms in there and you know I

746
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:24,898
started out with the half cocoa half

747
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:26,820
paper shreds in there and food scraps so

748
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:29,158
I'm putting the greens in there banana

749
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:31,500
peels coffee grounds but I want to learn

750
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:33,120
more about like how you do it now you

751
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,859
mentioned the lasagna method is that

752
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,678
kind of the only way you go about the

753
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:39,479
composting or do you have like piles and

754
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,740
add in food scraps or what do you

755
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,058
typically do

756
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,960
yeah

757
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:49,019
um the lasagna gardening method can act

758
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,659
as a compost pile you can really just go

759
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:53,579
out there and throw your food scraps

760
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:56,159
with that if you're in an environment

761
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:57,960
that has like deer and raccoons and all

762
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,340
those little critters like you're

763
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,860
definitely going to want to try and bury

764
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:03,658
that as far down as you can even if

765
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:05,879
you're just tossing it out there

766
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:10,919
just a little tip but

767
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:12,419
we started our compost pile I've had my

768
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,038
horse for

769
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:15,840
about two and a half years now so when

770
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,819
he came we really really got into it

771
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,398
because we had a ton of excess manure

772
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:21,898
and so we put

773
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,959
um

774
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:28,459
the pallets like moving palettes around

775
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:32,100
and we made like just two little squares

776
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:34,500
a few little scraps two little screws

777
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:36,240
right now I guess right yeah yes exactly

778
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,819
two little Bays so we just started

779
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,940
adding his manure and of course like

780
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:43,859
there's a bunch of um like dirt and all

781
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,019
of the natural elements but like also

782
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:47,699
the straws and the hay two different

783
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:50,639
kinds of hay so we have a prairie hay

784
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:53,538
and we have an alfalfa hay and grass

785
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:57,000
clippings and leaves and food and

786
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:59,940
anything that we could really utilize we

787
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,659
threw in there and um

788
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:05,278
definitely got hot

789
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:08,399
definitely got hot enough to break down

790
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:10,319
the scary bacterias

791
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:12,359
um and then you just rotate it and I

792
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:14,639
know people like you can probe it to

793
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:16,979
like take your temperatures on it we

794
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,080
didn't get that scientific okay you just

795
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:23,700
really winging it out here

796
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:25,678
um but yeah it's so crazy so we took

797
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,960
that three-year compost so we moved it

798
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,899
to our six rows at the back to top those

799
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:33,538
guys off but just after turning it and

800
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:36,538
having it for so long this stuff breaks

801
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:38,460
down into the richest

802
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:42,960
you'd think it smelled terrible but it

803
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:45,298
smells so so good so rich and like so

804
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,058
much like dirt I know that sounds funny

805
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:51,418
but from going from manure to dirt it's

806
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:53,460
just such a a radical process like you

807
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:55,679
can physically hold this in

808
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,079
I think we can all do it now just tell

809
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,120
when like that soil is super rich and

810
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:04,918
it's ready to be planted in versus

811
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:06,898
crumbly crusty or too tight and it's

812
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:10,380
just not plentiful so like being able to

813
00:33:06,898 --> 00:33:10,918
see the difference was seriously

814
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,659
um

815
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:14,220
that's shocking because I knew it was

816
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:15,600
Kimmy but it's like okay yes we're doing

817
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,220
the right thing you know it was

818
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:20,278
validating

819
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:22,380
and uh yeah it's so much simpler than

820
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:24,179
than I think the internet and some

821
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,159
people even tried to make it it sounds

822
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:27,778
really complex on the internet you have

823
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,760
to have all of these elements and you

824
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:31,259
have to prove it you have to turn it a

825
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,460
thousand times and you have to keep it

826
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:37,980
moist to keep everything alive

827
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,840
it's not as not as complex as it seems

828
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,778
online so that's our process it's really

829
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:45,058
easy and if we're not using our food

830
00:33:42,778 --> 00:33:47,940
scraps where compost we feed it to our

831
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:49,819
livestock mostly our pigs they just go

832
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:53,700
crazy for bucket feed

833
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:55,259
and then they do the whole process and

834
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,840
then they turn that into compost

835
00:33:55,259 --> 00:34:00,419
themselves and they push it into our our

836
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:03,778
grass that they're on and

837
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:05,759
yeah fun stuff

838
00:34:03,778 --> 00:34:07,319
that's awesome yeah closed loop

839
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:09,059
operation I mean that's kind of a lot of

840
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:11,418
people's goal is to kind of get to that

841
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:14,338
to where they're using their compost as

842
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:16,500
fertilizer really and

843
00:34:14,338 --> 00:34:18,299
um rewarding I guess is probably the

844
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,878
word that I would use for when you

845
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,159
successfully compost something because I

846
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:25,019
had that feeling before I'll never

847
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,820
forget the first time where I dug into

848
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:29,460
my vermicompost bin like probably about

849
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:31,500
six months after eight months after I

850
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:34,079
started it and just kind of digging down

851
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,639
you see in that uh you know Black Gold a

852
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,519
lot of people prefer it to where it's

853
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:40,740
just so good and uh being able to take

854
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:43,079
that and then top dress my plants and

855
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:44,819
then not have to worry about adding any

856
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:46,319
additional fertilizers on top of that

857
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,539
but yeah it's pretty cool and I I

858
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,519
totally agree with you where it's not as

859
00:34:48,539 --> 00:34:53,460
hard as people make it out to be on the

860
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:55,320
internet it could really be simple if

861
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,780
you take the simple approach so yeah

862
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,440
well said there I think everybody wants

863
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,440
sound like a little

864
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,940
bit rated maybe a little bit smarter

865
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:07,980
than they might be that sounds to me but

866
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,539
I promise it's not but they just they

867
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,820
want to make it complex so they have

868
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:13,440
like this valuable information you know

869
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,200
instead of just like here you go this is

870
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,400
how you do it it's real pretty easy

871
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,559
absolutely so do you have any other

872
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,380
advice that you want to talk about in

873
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:24,358
this podcast episode or uh maybe any

874
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,099
maybe some advice for beginners that are

875
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:27,719
kind of just starting outdoor growing

876
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:30,300
yeah

877
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:32,759
um so learn your zones like your

878
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,920
gardening zones that's super important

879
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,619
for outside you need to know when you're

880
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,838
going to run into your your last frost

881
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:41,700
date and then your first frost date so

882
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:43,679
you know when to start and when you need

883
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:45,059
to harvest by

884
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,899
um

885
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:49,920
and it's more important for your start

886
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:52,559
when you're starting seedlings because

887
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,220
you do not want those to get roast at

888
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:55,380
all

889
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:59,338
um if you're you're

890
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:03,000
almost ready Harvest plants freeze once

891
00:35:59,338 --> 00:36:05,578
it'll be okay believe it or not

892
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,219
um and learn your pests in what you have

893
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:09,180
in your environment already you need to

894
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:10,199
learn

895
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:12,358
um

896
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:14,159
you know of course like how much

897
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:18,539
sunlight you're getting in the specific

898
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:20,279
area that you're looking to grow and

899
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:22,139
be careful when you're picking strains

900
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,280
like if you're in a place like me like

901
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:29,279
sativa dominant strains do much better

902
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:31,619
than indicas because they're short squat

903
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,420
tight and that is a really good way to

904
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:35,099
get boisterous or Bud wrap because

905
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,358
there's just not a lot of airflow in

906
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:37,260
there

907
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:40,199
um

908
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:43,020
if you can have your soils tested but

909
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:44,598
it's not 100 necessary put your hands in

910
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:47,519
it feel around

911
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:49,140
again use your resources so if you don't

912
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,838
have manure and you want to look into

913
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:54,659
that side of composting

914
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:57,179
hunt down a barn with boarding horses go

915
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:59,578
to your local farmer ask your neighbor

916
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:01,379
that has goats and rabbits because all

917
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:03,780
of that is super beneficial and chickens

918
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,960
if they can collect chicken poop for you

919
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,740
that's wonderful

920
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,280
um

921
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:14,939
and start a compost pile outside or

922
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:18,420
start a compost bin at doors and utilize

923
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:20,519
it please let's do it you can do it it's

924
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,639
fun and

925
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:26,639
um yeah I think just keep it simple and

926
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:28,259
just go do it it will all be okay I've

927
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:29,940
got some really good advice so let's

928
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,619
wrap things up tell the listeners how

929
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,179
they can find you and is there anything

930
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:34,440

931
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:36,480

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,760
not just medicinal plant content for

940
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,180
YouTube and Instagram but also bring you

941
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,040
the homesteading content to

942
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:07,559
primarily YouTube and more into

943
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:09,838
Instagram to show how both of these

944
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:12,420
Worlds Collide and they Collide super
