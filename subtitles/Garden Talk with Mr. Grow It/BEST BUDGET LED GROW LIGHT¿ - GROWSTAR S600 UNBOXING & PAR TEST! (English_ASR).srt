1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,359
well what's up everybody feel that don't

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,980
know me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:08,339
and you're watching my extra channel

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,440
this is the grossed rs600 LED grow light

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:12,480
in this video I'm gonna unbox a unit and

6
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:14,459
also test the power output I've actually

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,310
had several requests of people wanting

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,289
to see more budget LEDs so I think this

9
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,269
light really fits into that category if

10
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,769
you want to see more budget LEDs on this

11
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:24,089
channel hit that thumbs up button and

12
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:25,829
let me know in the comment section below

13
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:28,259
I purchased this girl light off of

14
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:31,259
Amazon at a discount currently it looks

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,179
like there is a $10 off coupon not sure

16
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,920
how long this will last but I did want

17
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:37,079
to point that out when it arrived to my

18
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,689
house it of course came in an Amazon box

19
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,789
once I open up the Amazon box there was

20
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:43,679
the box with the LED grow light in it

21
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:45,719
upon opening the box the first thing

22
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,609
here is the instruction manual this

23
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,239
instruction manual has a ton of various

24
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:53,009
information such as safety information

25
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,959
specifications on the grill light it has

26
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:57,149
three additional models on top of that

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,399
which it talks about and compares it

28
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,960
lists what the power output is what the

29
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,359
spectrum looks like and what the

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,599
warranty terms are next out the box is

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,510
the power cord one ratchet hanger one

32
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,859
wire hanger and then of course the LED

33
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,750
grow light if you want to know the

34
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:13,950
specific features about this grow light

35
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,228
I will link it in the description

36
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,570
section below for the part test I'm

37
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:21,269
going to use the app og MQ 500 power

38
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:24,419
meter this measures from 389 nanometers

39
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:26,959
to 692 nanometers plus or minus 5

40
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,040
nanometers and measurements are in ppfd

41
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,929
this is just going to give you a general

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,979
idea of what the power output is it's

43
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,868
not meant to be a hundred percent

44
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:35,789
accurate I am taking measurements in a

45
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:37,590
grow tent which has reflective walls so

46
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,630
that could increase the numbers so just

47
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,579
keep that in mind the user manual says

48
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:43,469
this has a coverage area of nine feet by

49
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:46,408
eight feet and the Amazon listing says

50
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:49,289
as a core coverage area of 5.2 feet by

51
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,509
4.9 feet both of those must be in

52
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,759
correct lights this size are best suited

53
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,469
for a two foot by two foot grow space in

54
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,659
my opinion I've placed the light in a

55
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:59,459
two foot by four foot Croton and I have

56
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,140
the light on one side of the grow tent

57
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,149
and I'll be sure to keep the meter on

58
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,399
one side so measurements are taken in a

59
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,540
two foot by two foot space I'll be

60
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,270
taking measurements at three different

61
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,250
distances twelve inches away eighteen

62
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,260
inches away and then twenty four inches

63
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,110
away let's see what these measurements

64
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:38,508
look like

65
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:38,509

what do you think of these measurements

76
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,970
let me know in the comment section below

77
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:13,680

78
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,729
light in the description section below

79
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,319
so you can find out more information

80
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:17,728
