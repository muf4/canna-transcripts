brand new Growers and teaching them the

108

vernacular uh showing them that they can

109
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,280

110
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,280
equipment a ton of you know expensive

111
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,079
equipment and uh I just wanted to show

112
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,079
everybody that they didn't have to pay

113
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,120
high dispensary prices and that they

114
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,560
could do this even if they were having

115
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,280
trouble uh getting started with it in

116
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,839

119
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,478
use this equipment that you have you

120
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:29,399
didn't have to go out and buy anything

121
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:31,319

00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:03,519
natural and then harvesting and

138
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,239
obviously consuming your Harvest now

139

you've gotten to the point where you are

140
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,079
breeding what got you into breeding uh

141
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,560
you know it's a couple of things I would

142
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,000
be uh it wouldn't be right if I said it

143
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,000
was just one thing but you know the

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,240
Natural Curiosity and just wanting to

145
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,918
you know learn about this plant that I

146
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,519
you know loved so long you know so much

147
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:26,399
for so long and uh and I just figured it

148
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:29,758
was kind of the the next steps I'm a

149
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,198
very big uh Chaser of effects so uh

150
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,120
don't really care about the color or you

151
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,680
know what the fade of it looks like or

152
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,680
anything like that I'm very big since

153
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,720
I'm a medical patient with it on how the

154
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,560
plant or the cultiv bar or strain

155
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,400
whatever the hip lingo is these days I'm

156
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,160
very uh I'm I'm a constant Chaser of the

157
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,159
effect of whatever I'm smoking on

158
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,240
because I have ADHD and I have really

159
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,880
bad anxiety and uh I actually use this

160
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,439
plant to control it I used to be on

161
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:00,000
three different medications and now I

162
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,000
take none and I just you know literally

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,918
walk around with dugouts in my pocket

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,360
and then just apply kind of as needed so

165
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:09,719
it's one of those things where uh you

166
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,120
know I really like what this plant does

167
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,880
but I don't really like the taste of it

168
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,478
but you know how it affects like my

169
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,800
anxiety is it's immeasurable on how much

170
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:19,758
I like it so what if I took this plant

171
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,280
over here and then I crossed it with

172
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,960
this plant over here where I really like

173
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,478
the taste of it and uh you know that's

174
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,279
you know how it all started and my wife

175
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,879
says that uh my ADHD can work as a super

176
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:35,279
power for me because I can hyperfocus on

177
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:37,000
things that I'm interested in and uh so

178
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,439
I can pick up learning curves on things

179
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,759
pretty easily because of that hyperfocus

180
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:45,399
that I get from it and uh uh you it just

181
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,560
uh anytime I turn my attention onto

182
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:49,038
something I usually go pretty hard in

183
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,120
the paint trying to figure out how to do

184
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,680
it myself so so how many years has it

185
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,079
been now since you've been actually

186
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,240
doing the breeding uh seven seven years

187
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:59,719
so I still consider myself you know

188
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,280
completely uh like new to this we we'

189
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,840
had some really cool stuff that we've

190
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:06,239
made I say we but it's just literally me

191
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:09,279
um we just sounds more normal for some

192
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,000
reason but uh I've made some pretty cool

193
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,918
stuff and I still consider myself you

194
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,439
know new to this field with only seven

195
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,959
years under my belt uh you know breeding

196
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,038
and stuff like that but I've had a

197
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:21,959
really good time doing it uh whenever I

198
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:24,800
first started doing it you know I was

199
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,159
putting the videos up and uh I didn't

200
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,800
think anybody would be interested in I

201
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,120
was just kind of documenting what I was

202
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,478
doing and people are like hey how do we

203
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,759
get some of those I was like for what

204
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:35,800
what are you talking about and then they

205
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,199
were like no we want those and so I you

206
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,000
know whenever originally started it was

207
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,879
literally I was just doing it for myself

208
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,519
and then people are like well wait no we

209
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,759
want to do that we want those and I was

210
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,359
like oh okay and that's that's pretty

211
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,240
much just how it started how it got me

212
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,840
into it so so what do you personally

213
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:56,519
like for taste smell and effects uh you

214
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:58,000
know I I I find my my myself changing as

215
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:00,240
I've gotten older cuz whenever I was

216
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,839
younger it was literally just SK junky

217
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,360
dies and then anything that could kind

218
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,839
of calm my mind down is like the effect

219
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,000
that I was always chasing with it is I

220
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,679
always tell people my brain feels like

221
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,639
it's on a train and it's tring to go

222
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,360
down 30 different tracks at the same

223
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,519
time and whenever I smoke dude it just

224
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,158
like and it just like centers it back

225
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:26,639
down onto one track and I can like focus

226
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:29,038
and you know and run down that just one

227
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,918
track at a time like my wife she's very

228
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,158
good on calling me out on it she'll be

229
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:35,000
like you've switched subjects three

230
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:37,319
times in the last 10 minutes she's like

231
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,519
go upstairs and smoke and then come back

232
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,399
down and try talking again because

233
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,120
whenever I haven't smoked dude like I'll

234
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,519
bounce I'll get like three you know

235
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,879
three fours the way through explaining

236
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,360
my point and that'll remind me of

237
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:49,039
something else and then I'll jump to a

238
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,320
different subject and jump to a

239
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,278
different subject and I actually do it

240
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,040
in my videos and I used to have to spend

241
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:57,879
a ton of time editing it out and like

242
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:00,199
refocusing it back onto the subject at

243
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:01,759
hand and so that's kind of where the

244
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,278
channel the little mantra for the

245
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,278
channel where I you you'll hear me I'll

246
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,639
say calm down Focus relax you know and

247
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:10,320
uh it's just me kind of trying to

248
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:12,399
reenter myself to stay on topic because

249
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,200
otherwise I get I'll just jump all over

250
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,320
the place and a video that was supposed

251
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,759
to be about this is five minutes in

252
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,399
there of talking about something else

253
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,200
and I'm like all right Cal down and then

254
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,000
uh everybody started saying I got tired

255
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,360
of editing out the videos is all it ever

256
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,839
was and then I just started leaving it

257
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,360
in there and everybody really liked it

258
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:31,920
and now if you look on all of our shirt

259
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,639
designs you can actually see the relax

260
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,078
calm down and focus always hidden in the

261
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,919
design so you have a couple of your

262
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:40,599
t-shirts I know you see you wear them

263
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,319
all the time it's great yeah I do wear

264
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,040
them in some of the episodes as a

265
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,959
tie-dye one a couple tie-dye ones you

266
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:47,360
sent me and then a purple Frost giant

267
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,399
one which we'll I'm sure we'll be

268
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,320
talking about purple Frost giant here

269
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:54,159
pretty shortly yeah it's a great but as

270
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,440
far as the taste smell and effects that

271
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,319
you personally like are you looking to

272
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,000
do that in your breeding as well like

273
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,519
are those are characteristic or trades

274
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
you look for When selecting parent

275
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,519
plants for breeding projects or are you

276
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,360
kind of going after what the market

277
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,120
wants instead well I I'd be it'd be

278
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,039
remiss to say I wasn't paying attention

279
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,519
to the market because like some of these

280
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,039
breeding projects like if you take

281
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,399
anything out like you know seven or

282
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:19,120
eight Generations you could spend a

283
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,039
decade working on something and if it's

284
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,000
not something that the market wants then

285
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:26,679
you you spend a decade working on

286
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,839
something that's no longer popular like

287
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:29,599
you know what if you had somebody that

288
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,480
was like oh yeah I'm really into a track

289
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,639
players and I'm going to spend a bunch

290
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,440
of time you know making a cool a nobody

291
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:38,360
wants at track players anymore uh you

292
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,120
know like right now I feel like the main

293
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,839
majority of the markets really focus on

294
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:46,759
like Fruity or dessert kind of stuff and

295
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,519
so I do take those factors in there but

296
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:52,159
my main my main goal whenever I'm

297
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,480
breeding is effect it's effect driven

298
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:57,319
sure I love when they smell fantastic I

299
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,039
love uh The Taste but it's and those

300
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,000
those factors do play into it but at the

301
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:04,519
same time since I'm a med I come at it

302
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,799
with a medical kind of perspective so

303
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,240
it's 100% how does this affect me how do

304
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,159
I like it how do the people that tried

305
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,799
it like it do they like this at all you

306
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,360
know if they don't like it you know I've

307
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,799
had ones where I made where I thought

308
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,200
they were great but they just did not

309
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:22,439
get a great reception from like the

310
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,240
public and you know that's why you do

311
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,519
tester runs where you're like did you

312
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,278
guys like this they're like yeah it grew

313
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,078
great but I didn't really like the

314
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,078
flavor profile or you know maybe it came

315
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:33,599
out a little extra mtholly or something

316
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:35,359
like that and you know it's just you

317
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,720
have to base your decisions on you know

318
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,600
kind of like the majority of your your

319
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,440
clientele what they like you know stuff

320
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,680
like that if I was just making it for

321
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,279
for me then I wouldn't care what anybody

322
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:47,958
else said you know what I mean that

323
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:49,879
makes sense I'm sure it's you got to be

324
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,239
a balancing act right a little bit of a

325
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:54,720
little bit of both you got to satisfy

326
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:57,839
yourself and the market yeah now I mean

327
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,759
luckily the the market isn't too too far

328
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,040
away from what I like uh some of the

329
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:05,200
more like candy smelling strains you

330
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:07,078
know I'm not terribly fond of but

331
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,200
there's a big there's a big push for

332
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:10,799
them in the market so I understand that

333
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,720
and I take that into consideration when

334
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,559
I'm thinking about like crosses or which

335
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,120
phenotypes I'm hunting down and stuff

336
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,638
like that because what I exactly want

337
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,879
might not always be exactly what the

338
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,360
market wants like I've had bags where

339
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,958
open it up and it literally smelled like

340
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,320
you stuck your head in a bag full of

341
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,958
candy and I'm just like me you know but

342
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,199
other people like I would use that bag

343
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,638
to show off to people I'm like here

344
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:33,278
smell this and they're like oh my God I

345
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,759
freaking love it I'm just like

346
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:38,120
amateur you know it's just it's just one

347
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,720
of those things where like I can see the

348
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,879
appeal to it it might not be my favorite

349
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,079
thing but I understand where it comes

350
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,360
from because you know whenever I was

351
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:49,599
younger smelled like that it just it

352
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,000
just smelled like you know skunky you

353
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,800
know easily kind of now it like you can

354
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,879
smell candies and different you know

355
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:59,439
scents and flavor profiles and uh but

356
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:02,480
it's not to say I don't appreciate it

357
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,279
cuz I do because I I appreciate every

358
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,680
you know every single thing about this

359
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:09,399
plan I love it man I totally hear you

360
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:11,359
with the candy stuff I mean I I'm not

361
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:14,120
too crazy about that either I'm more of

362
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,120
like a skunky even like I even favor

363
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,320
earthy more and the candy type stuff and

364
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,759
yeah yeah but everybody has their own

365
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,560
thing you know everybody has their own

366
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:26,600
likes and preferences so dude that's

367
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,919
what's so great about this plant is like

368
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,320
you're like oh yeah I really love this

369
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,360
strain and the next day is like e that

370
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,959
was okay to me but I really like this

371
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,278
one and there's just so many different

372
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,518
varieties and variations of the plant

373
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,078
that well I didn't really like this one

374
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,039
but I really like this one and that's

375
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:43,159
why I always tell me I was like try a

376
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,319
bunch of them until you find something

377
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:45,719
you really like I call it when you find

378
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,560
your soulmate strain where you're just

379
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,800
like oh my God this this is exactly what

380
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:50,958
I'm looking for and then you go on this

381
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:52,359
thing where you're like this is all I

382
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,278
want to smoke I imagine it's kind of

383
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,800
like a Rob with his like headbanger or

384
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:58,439
whichever or whichever what's that one

385
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:00,159
he likes really a lot hard to grow yeah

386
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,920
headbanger but yeah like I found a

387
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:05,838
really one I really liked in your your

388
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:09,838
Gen 2 genetics uh it was super earthy

389
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,839
and like super lemony and uh as soon as

390
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,759
I found that one I was like you're my

391
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,120
mom I was like and then I pulled it and

392
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:15,959
then turned it to where I pull all my

393
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,720
clones from of it so I was like Yep this

394
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:20,719
is the one I want come with

395
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,000
me yeah I definitely want to get deeper

396
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,560
into that one that's one of your recent

397
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,360
crosses but I want to start with your

398
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,719
first cross you ever made tell us a

399
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,959
story about that uh you know this was

400
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:36,560
one of the ones where I was not a huge

401
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:38,799
fan of like uh like the smell or the

402
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,319
taste of it but the effect it had

403
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,240
remember I'm a super effect driven

404
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,759
person since I was using it for medical

405
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,680
stuff you know I was not a huge fan of

406
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,278
the taste but the way it it would work

407
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,359
with my ADHD and how well it worked for

408
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:51,559
me it's just one of those things where I

409
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,079
smoked it all the time and it was

410
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:55,159
literally just White Widow cross with

411
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:56,599
big buds and I would smoke it all the

412
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:57,958
time just because of the effect that it

413
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,639
had now regular white widow I was a

414
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:02,479
pretty big fan of taste and smell some

415
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,639
reason this white widow cross with big

416
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,920
buds it worked like I it used to be what

417
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,560
I would call my soulmate strain where

418
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:12,120
I'm like it works so exactly for what I

419
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:14,039
need and like you know I can I can smoke

420
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,720
it I can still go do a ton of stuff it

421
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:19,078
like quiets my mind as I would say and

422
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,879
then it calms me down and it was just it

423
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:23,239
worked so well it was actually the

424
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,799
strain that I found that got me to I

425
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,839
went from three medications down to one

426
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,958
as soon as I you know started smoking it

427
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,440
was it was like a god that that was

428
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:34,758
given to me

429
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,319
and I was like now if I can just get it

430
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:37,759
to taste a little bit better that was

431
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:39,078
the whole point with I mean the whole

432
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,759
thing this is like the whole reason to

433
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:42,879
start into the journey was literally

434
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:45,039
just for that and uh that was the whole

435
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,799
thing like I crossed it with this Alas

436
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,159
and purple that I really liked because

437
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:53,359
I'm a huge fan of like like a birthday

438
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:54,958
cake or like cake batter like taste and

439
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,959
uh so I crossed it with this Alaskan

440
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,039
purple string that I had that smelled

441
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,239
exactly like I used to say it was like

442
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,559
right if you pulled like a confet you

443
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,120
just made a cake like a confetti cake

444
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:09,039
vanilla confetti cake base and then you

445
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,198
put like vanilla icing on it like that

446
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,318
smell that you get when you put out with

447
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:15,000
like the icing on a hot cake like that

448
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:16,799
smell that you get was the exact smell

449
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,639
that I was getting off of this Alaskan

450
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,278
purple and I was like if I could get

451
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,159
this into here and I was like wait I

452
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:24,639
might be able to do that and then I

453
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:27,439
started you know that was kind of like

454
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,159
where I took off with with that and you

455
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,920
know just I never went into it with ever

456
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,240
thinking about doing it for the masses I

457
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:36,679
was literally just doing it for myself I

458
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,440
didn't think there would be ever be any

459
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:42,838
any interest in it I was just you know

460
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:44,319
showing people how to grow on video and

461
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,720
and I was literally just doing it for

462
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:48,439
myself so it was one of those things

463
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,759
where it was never like even a thought

464
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,399
in my head of ever bringing it out it

465
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,318
was just something I was just doing for

466
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,679
myself that's crazy and then what was

467
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:57,799
the name of that cross I don't think you

468
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,439
mentioned it uh that one was in it I

469
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:01,719
called it giant purple mon

470
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,920
oh okay all right got it so one of your

471
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,519
more recent crosses is a collaboration

472
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,959
between you and I which honored that you

473
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:09,558
reached out to me and you wanted to do

474
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,600
this collaboration I thought that was so

475
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:14,318
cool yeah it's called Magic Candy

476
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,519
Mountain OG talk to us all about that

477
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,838
well you know whenever I was coming up

478
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:20,400
with the name for it well just even back

479
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:22,359
that up even further you know I had you

480
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,640
had sent me some of your stuff before

481
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:26,879
and I was a big fan of it like that

482
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,919
earthiness and like the lemon that I got

483
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,520
from the first time that's like right up

484
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:34,799
my alley and so I grew it it it was a

485
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,639
great grow Fant the plant responds to

486
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:39,119
training fantastically I you know every

487
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,000
aspect about the chill out OG I was a

488
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:44,119
fan of already and then I was like well

489
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,599
what if I take this and I I had a super

490
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:48,839
grae feno of the purple Frost giant that

491
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:52,558
I ended up with that I keep mothers of

492
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:55,199
that that's like my now soulmate strain

493
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:58,158
that I constantly am walking around with

494
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,240
just because how well it works for me

495
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:02,240
and even as a guy this is hurts me to

496
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,759
say even as a guy that is super like a

497
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,000
skunky dies kind of guy to walk around

498
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:08,679
with the strain that smells like

499
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,839
freaking grape soda you know like at all

500
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:12,320
the time I'm

501
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:14,918
like you know at the same time cuz I'm

502
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,759
like I've transitioned I've transitioned

503
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:18,960
over to the other side I like something

504
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:20,558
has happened to me I'm walking around

505
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,919
with a strain I mean it literally smells

506
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:25,319
like grape vest soda like that smell you

507
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:28,120
get when you first open like a can not a

508
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:30,519
bottle but an actual can of like grape

509
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:32,678
soda like that smell from that fizz that

510
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:35,038
initially comes out of there it smells

511
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:38,159
exactly like that and I was like okay I

512
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:40,038
can never get rid of this and I'm

513
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:43,320
actually into generation three I'm

514
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:45,960
working on to it right now and it's uh I

515
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:48,158
was like how cool would this be to cross

516
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,120
this with Mr growz I was like I think it

517
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:54,280
would be amazing and then I designed a

518
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,239
whole thing of merch and you know I you

519
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:58,918
sent me

520
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,759
those uh a while ago last year and I

521
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,240
pled it all 5050 all at the same time I

522
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:05,000
think I got 50 or 60 I pled them all at

523
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,759
the same time and then just and I was

524
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,480
like you know keep super dedicated

525
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:11,798
labeling of everything I end up the one

526
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,880
I I like the best was uh from a second

527
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:16,599
generation one of the ones you sent so I

528
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,120
was pretty freaking stoked with it and I

529
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:20,359
think I put some pictures up on my

530
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,119
Instagram cuz YouTube yells at me

531
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:25,798
whenever I try to show any kind of plant

532
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:28,719
on my videos and uh and it could be a

533
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:30,319
drawing I put a drawing a drawing it was

534
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,200
wasn't even a plant it was a drawing of

535
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,759
the plant I put on there and I got age

536
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,038
restricted on it it was just a drawing

537
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,919
of a leaf it wasn't even the whole plant

538
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:40,960
it was literally just a leaf and I got

539
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,799
age restricted from a hand drawing of a

540
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,679
leaf I was like all right all right I

541
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:48,679
apologize I give up I won't even show a

542
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,840
cartoon drawing of

543
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:54,519
it so it was just it was just one of

544
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,359
those things where I I had liked it in

545
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:58,200
the past and if I like something you

546
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:59,599
know you know I want to explore down

547
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,038
that road

548
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,279
and then you know it was just it was one

549
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:05,558
of those things and then like I got the

550
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,639
name from an old internet video that I

551
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:11,480
used to watch and I thought it it worked

552
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,159
well with it and uh once I had that once

553
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,200
I had the name kind of figured out for

554
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:16,799
it and then I did the artwork for it

555
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,440
because I like to do artwork for

556
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:22,319
everything and it was just it it seemed

557
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,480
like a no-brainer to to mix the two with

558
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,639
how much I liked both so I save the

559
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,120
artwork right

560
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,038
here yeah there you go I love your

561
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,199
artwork man all of it's kind of similar

562
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:35,158
style and it's really cool that you do

563
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,798
that for each release and you do shirts

564
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:39,559
too right yeah so I mean I got one on I

565
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:42,240
got one on right now I've sent you a few

566
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:43,960
I think I've sent rob a few uh pigeons

567
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,279
I've I've I've messaged him a few times

568
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,679
about getting an address from I've never

569
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,038
got an address from them so I can't I've

570
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:51,159
never been able to send pigeons anything

571
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:55,000
up there in Canada and uh but yeah I do

572
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:58,600
artwork for every single drop um I spend

573
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,279
a lot of time on the artwork and uh I do

574
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:02,599
I individual it for the drop and then I

575
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:05,000
never I never do them again so they're

576
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:06,759
kind of like time stamps as to where you

577
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,319
were kind of like hanging out with the

578
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:11,000
channel because if you have a shirt I

579
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:12,399
only make them once and then I never

580
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,599
make them again so you either got them

581
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,840
whenever they dropped or you don't ever

582
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:19,079
have the opportunity to get one again

583
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:20,759
and I don't ever even tell the public

584
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:23,240
whenever they're going live I might for

585
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:25,319
like a Black Friday thing once a year

586
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,558
but in general you have to literally be

587
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:29,678
on the patreon to even see when the

588
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:31,240
merch store is going to go live live and

589
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,278
then whenever it does I usually only

590
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,839
keep it up for either a weekend or four

591
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:36,679
or five days and then I close it back

592
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:38,959
down immediately you got to get it while

593
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:40,759
it's still there yeah yeah the magic

594
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,319
Candy Mountain OG I'm looking forward to

595
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:44,759
Growing myself I haven't grown it out

596
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,879
yet just got my hands on it and uh got

597
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:48,759
one that just sprouted so I'm eager to

598
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,960
see how this one turns out and I'm super

599
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:54,240
excited so appreciate you doing that

600
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,880
cross yeah I got pictures of it on on my

601
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,880
Instagram and I just went by and just

602
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,840
clipped off a few Buds and I have my

603
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,320
hand laying out like in the picture and

604
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:04,879
I just grabbed a couple buds and you

605
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:06,798
can't see my hand under the just the

606
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,919
three buds that I clipped off like you

607
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,359
could maybe see like a fingertip over on

608
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:14,960
one side but the coolest part about it

609
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,359
was like everything turned purple on the

610
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,400
whole thing like all the tricomes were

611
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:20,399
purple the sugar leaves were purple all

612
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,400
the bud was purple I was like this

613
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,679
really is

614
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,840
Magic I like this is

615
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,640
fantastic that's incredible that's

616
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:29,720
really really cool he must be growing

617
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,759
some pretty big plants there how big of

618
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,480
plants do you grow for breeding projects

619
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:35,599
and container what size container you

620
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,839
putting them in uh I don't really like

621
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,519
growing in anything over a 5 gallon pot

622
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:42,839
I'm just not a fan of the of the bigger

623
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:44,839
pots uh I don't have a problem with them

624
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:47,399
per se it's just three to five gallons

625
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:48,599
depending on my plant count per tent uh

626
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,240
if I have a higher plant count I

627
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,879
probably won't go over a three gallon

628
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,558
pot if I have uh like if I have like

629
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,080
four plants in a 5x5 I'll go up to a

630
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:59,158
five gallon pot so it's not anything

631
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,720
crazy

632
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:04,400
I like the amount of uh dry days I get

633
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,400
out of the slightly smaller pots than

634
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,120
the than the than the slightly bigger

635
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,519
pots and uh you know just personal

636
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:12,678
preference I don't I wouldn't have a

637
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,599
problem if somebody's like yeah growing

638
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:16,480
seven or 10 G I don't care you know

639
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:18,119
doesn't I don't think it has you know

640
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,960
too big of effect the only thing that

641
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:23,079
you know I like I just that's the style

642
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,640
of growing I prefer is just the slightly

643
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:26,960
smaller slightly smaller pots and the

644
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,360
nutrients you use is going to have

645
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,360
impact on it as well what are you using

646
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:32,918
for nutrients and how are you doing

647
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:35,439
feedings throughout the life of the

648
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:36,600
plant now when you're breeding some

649
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,159
people do it a little bit differently

650
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:41,719
than when you're growing the plant just

651
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,760
regularly so what do you do yeah so I I

652
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,000
Still Rock General Hydroponics uh

653
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,679
three-part and it's not like because I'm

654
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,319
like oh my goodness these nutrients are

655
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,320
so much better whenever people are

656
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,839
getting

657
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:57,000
into uh growing uh I generally if they

658
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:58,959
go to their local stores or whatever the

659
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,759
likelihood of them finding the General

660
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,600
Hydroponics three part is probably along

661
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,558
the top of the list of things they'll be

662
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,399
easy for them to find so it was really

663
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:10,119
it was never that I like that brand

664
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,798
better it was literally just about if a

665
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:14,000
new person does this what would be the

666
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:16,038
easiest nutrient line for them to five

667
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,119
cuz you I mean or to find cuz you could

668
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:20,480
go get some you know oh well I really

669
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:22,278
like this you know uh nectar of the gods

670
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,480
or whatever it might be way harder to

671
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:25,960
find for somebody at their grow store

672
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,919
than something else they might not carry

673
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,840
that line they might only carry Flex or

674
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,120
they might you know whatever you you

675
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:34,079
could go through there's you know

676
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:36,439
thousands of nutrient manufacturers so

677
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,480
it was literally just about what's the E

678
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,000
what would be the easiest for a new

679
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,240
person to find or what would be the most

680
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,519
recognizable and uh that I still grow

681
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,480
with it to this day just for that reason

682
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:49,200
and uh but yeah like you were saying I

683
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,000
100% treat them different rather we're

684
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,919
breeding plants or if I'm just growing

685
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,679
them out

686
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,720
regularly the only thing that kind of

687
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:59,640
stays the same is in the veg cycle cuz I

688
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,159
generally don't be while they're in veg

689
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,080
because I buy pre- amended soil and the

690
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,399
pre- amended soil I don't know if people

691
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,599
know this but it already has the food in

692
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:08,839
it that's why you cost so much because

693
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:10,639
the nutrients that you would need to

694
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:11,959
give them they're already in the soil

695
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,320
the plant can literally break down

696
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,840
what's in the soil and eat it's just

697
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:16,839
like if you took something in nert and

698
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:18,558
put like dry slow relase dry Ms in it

699
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:20,558
it's the same principle the food's

700
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,200
already in there you don't have to feed

701
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,678
so since I'm transplanting going from

702
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,759
like cubes to Solo cups to one gallons

703
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:28,919
to threes and then maybe to fives

704
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:30,240
whenever I go to flower every time you

705
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,759
transplant you can't think of it as

706
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,519
you're just putting in new dirt you're

707
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:34,839
literally you're feeding the plant

708
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:36,440
that's all new dirt it's got new new

709
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:38,879
nutrients in it so you're technically

710
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:42,000
feeding I just am not going in there and

711
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,120
manually you know making uh a nutrient

712
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,319
mix but the whole time the plants and

713
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:49,959
flow I just treat it like it's uh like

714
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:53,398
the end of veg and I give them equal

715
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:56,640
parts of nitrogen potassium and magnes

716
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:59,158
or uh phosphorus so I just give them

717
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,038
equal amounts whether it's four four and

718
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:03,240
four or five five and five I just give

719
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,158
them equal parts throughout and the only

720
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,079
other big difference is I never switch

721
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:08,720
over to mag sulfur from cow mag I give

722
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:11,158
them cow mag the

723
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,200
whole the whole way through the grow for

724
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:14,799
the extra calcium and they always need

725
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,558
magnesium so I just don't need the

726
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,278
bulking agent with the sulfur I know

727
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:21,200
some breeders who actually will stick

728
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:23,000
with the veg nutrients throughout all of

729
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,679
flowering yeah that's exactly what I do

730
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,240
it won't do anything that's exactly what

731
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:28,919
you do yeah that's exactly what I do I

732
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,319
do it like it's transition week so just

733
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,000
literally like it's the last week of

734
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:35,918
edge is the the method that I go to and

735
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,398
it's literally just four of nitrogen or

736
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,038
let's just say it's five of n five

737
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:41,359
milliters per gallon nitrogen five of

738
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:43,038
phosphorus and five of potassium and

739
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,639
they just stick with I stick with that

740
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:46,079
one because it's a nice balance of

741
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,278
everything it needs cuz I'm not going

742
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:50,759
for giant flower bulks or anything like

743
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:53,519
that uh it's a nice you know like a well

744
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:55,839
balanced diet for them hitting that food

745
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,398
triangle and I just carry that all the

746
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:00,319
way through and then normally if I was

747
00:26:57,398 --> 00:27:01,678
doing a normal flower cycle it would be

748
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,240
at the end of week three I would switch

749
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,278
off of cow mag and I would switch on to

750
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,720
mag sulfur product uh because the

751
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:08,640
stretch is over I no longer need the

752
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,839
calcium there's mag in both products so

753
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,240
I need mag all the way through and then

754
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:14,199
since the stretch is over and now I'm

755
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,720
going into the bulking phase after a

756
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,319
transition week of flow and week four

757
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,880
I'm now going into the bulking place of

758
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:21,599
phase of flour I don't care about the

759
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,278
bulking phase of the flour that's not

760
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,398
where my attention is nor is it where

761
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:28,200
the attention of the plant is because

762
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:29,839
it's received pollen by that point the

763
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,720
plants make you know that's one of the

764
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:35,278
tricks to making you know bigger buds is

765
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:37,798
we are denying them pollen and by

766
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,440
denying them pollen it causes them to

767
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:41,599
swell their buds because they're trying

768
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,080
to get bigger because pollen floats in

769
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:46,119
the air or to attract flying pollinators

770
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,720
anything like that by denying them

771
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:49,199
pollen it makes the bud get bigger and

772
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,919
bigger because they're trying to

773
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,360
increase surface area to catch that

774
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:55,399
pollen that's in the air well whenever

775
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:58,278
I've given them pollen I've specifically

776
00:27:55,398 --> 00:28:01,719
got pollen painting it on like Bob Ross

777
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:03,759
on on each of the buds uh that that

778
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,120
thing for bulking up the flowers isn't

779
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:06,839
there anymore because they've already

780
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:08,398
accomplished their life goal and their

781
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:10,199
life goal is they were trying to

782
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:12,158
reproduce and now they've reproduced

783
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,840
because they're making the seeds so so I

784
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,600
want to get into pollination I know that

785
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:18,158
you actually reverse plants and I want

786
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:20,439
to get into that afterwards first I want

787
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,440
to find out you talked about pollinating

788
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,320
females that needs to happen in order

789
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,440
for seeds to be developed right around

790
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:28,639
what day do you typically pollinate your

791
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,840
female plants

792
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,120
uh it's not really a day I really do it

793
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:34,038
based off Bud size and how the plant's

794
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,199
progressing because you have some

795
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:38,960
strains that you might have a you know

796
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,558
10 week strain versus an 8we strain or a

797
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,558
12 week strain so instead of hard

798
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:47,440
focusing on a day I actually do it by

799
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:50,398
plant development and size generally if

800
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,840
you have a 8 to n week flowering strain

801
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:53,359
it's going to be around the end of week

802
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:54,959
three somewhere in the beginning to

803
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,319
middle of week four is kind of like The

804
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,159
Sweet Spot I've found with them but if

805
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:01,519
you have a strin that takes longer to

806
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:03,159
flower and I go in and I pollinate it

807
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,079
week three my bud structure I might

808
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:06,440
still have those little tiny golf balls

809
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:08,199
with just the you know the starting

810
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,399
sprinklings of pistols that's way too

811
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,399
early to do this because if you

812
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:14,599
pollinate too early the bud size never

813
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:17,798
gets as big as it could have gotten if

814
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:19,240
you waited just like another week or so

815
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:21,240
and then plus you don't just don't have

816
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,919
a ton of pistol hairs to paint yet you

817
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,480
know like those pistol hairs are your

818
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:26,038
those are your receptor sites for the

819
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,440
pollen if there's not a ton of them yet

820
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:32,960
it's just it's too early to bring pollen

821
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,480
into the mix and uh it's really just

822
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,640
around generally it's just shoot for

823
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,798
week four and generally your buds are

824
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,278
big enough but if they're not just wait

825
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:42,679
a week it's not like it's there's a

826
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:44,200
timer on this like if you pollinate a

827
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:46,480
plant you ask anybody that's ever Herm

828
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,038
to plant you pollinate those plants at

829
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,278
week five week six of flour they're

830
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:53,960
making seeds they're going to do it uh

831
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:56,519
you know and if you look out into like

832
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,200
the you know you know the nature that

833
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:59,480
pollen's flying around the air all you

834
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,798
know all year and they got way longer

835
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,360
flower times whenever you're out there I

836
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:04,720
mean we all remember the the we used to

837
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:06,959
get back in the day what did you do when

838
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:10,120
you first got it you had to sit down on

839
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,840
your your TV tray or your little little

840
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:13,158
uh your rolling tray that you had and

841
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:15,240
what we had to do we had to pick out all

842
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:16,919
the seeds and all the stems on it and

843
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,839
that was somebody's job you had to sit

844
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:20,480
there and you had to pile the start and

845
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:22,000
then by the end you had what the shaky

846
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,079
stuff that you had left you had a pile

847
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,480
of seeds and a pile of stems and that's

848
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,918
what your job was to sit there and break

849
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,558
it all apart and now you can put that in

850
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:29,919
your bowls or whatever

851
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,519
yeah we didn't have this luxury of

852
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,120
having seed free back in the day I'm

853
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:36,200
glad those days are behind us and we

854
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:38,158
don't have to worry about seeds within

855
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,720
the buds yeah I've brought myself right

856
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,080
back around to it because pretty much

857
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,360
every month I'm harvesting seeded stuff

858
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:47,879
so luckily now I have machines that do

859
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:50,240
it for me though yeah so you bring up a

860
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,799
great point about when to pollinate the

861
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,519
females now there's a couple different

862
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:55,558
ways you can do the pollination process

863
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,638
right you could the way you're doing it

864
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:59,158
what you mentioned is you're actually

865
00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:00,319
painting the pollen onto buds other

866
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:01,720
folks what they'll do is they'll take

867
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,599
actually take the plant that they've

868
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,480
reversed or the male plant and they'll

869
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:07,839
stick it in the same room and just let

870
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,679
them let the wind naturally bring it

871
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:14,558
through air circulation or they actually

872
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:17,000
shake the plant within grow space why do

873
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:19,278
you choose to use the paintbrush and

874
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,440
Paint The Buds versus just shaking the

875
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:25,839
plant in the grow space clean up mess

876
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,360
that it makes uh whenever cuz I've done

877
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:28,678
I've done it a couple different ways

878
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:31,000
like there's actually videos where you

879
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:33,919
see me and I take the plant and I set it

880
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,480
on like a upside down 5 gallon bucket

881
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,278
and then I get a leaf blower and I stand

882
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,679
at the back of the tent and I pretended

883
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:41,319
like I was like Dock and I'm like all

884
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:44,440
right we got 88 gigawatts or whatever it

885
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:47,519
is and I'm blasting or 1.21 gigawatts

886
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,880
and I'm blasting the uh the the fan the

887
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,399
leaf blower fan right through the back

888
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,960
of the plant and the only Pro the only

889
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:55,439
the only reason that I don't do this is

890
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,840
just because of the mess it makes I mean

891
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,679
the entire room I don't think people

892
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:02,398
understand especially if you're working

893
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,720
with males the amount of pollen that

894
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:06,599
they make it's

895
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,200
insane that's why you don't have to

896
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:09,759
always you don't have to reverse a whole

897
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,319
plant you can just do a couple branches

898
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:14,638
just because those couple of branches

899
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:16,240
make so much pollen that it's you know

900
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:18,240
it's crazy how much that you're going to

901
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,480
get off of there and whenever I make a

902
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,960
mess with it I mean it's just I detail

903
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,519
clean very well in between grows and the

904
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,639
amount of Gunk that I have to get off

905
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,599
the walls and off the fans cuz I I like

906
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:31,879
I take the fans down I take the fans

907
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,439
apart I clean them I take the lights you

908
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,960
know I just detail clean everything in

909
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,840
between grows and the amount of extra

910
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,919
work it provides whenever I don't just

911
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:43,199
paint you know it takes me 30 seconds to

912
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:45,559
just sit there with I have this Barbie

913
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,360
brush you know it's hot pink like this

914
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:48,720
thing right here I have this Barbie

915
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:52,119
brush that I stole from my daughter's

916
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,120
makeup you know kit and it works so well

917
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:56,000
like I can absorb so much pollen with it

918
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:58,079
I can do the whole tint I can do the

919
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,558
whole tint with just one you know just

920
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,638
pick up a bunch of p i can I can paint

921
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:05,678
the whole tint with just one brush and

922
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:07,240
so uh the amount of work it saves me is

923
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,759
the main reason that I do it with a BRI

924
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,440
because they all work all those methods

925
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:11,679
that you mention whether you just put

926
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,440
one in if you're going to do that you

927
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,320
put it in front of your your fan so it

928
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,840
blows it out towards the rest of the tin

929
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:19,879
or whether you shake the plant all those

930
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:22,038
methods they all work just fine the only

931
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,600
reason I do it is just really simply

932
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:26,519
because of clean

933
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:28,079
up that's a good reason to do it right

934
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:30,278
yeah cuz I got a ton of other stuff in

935
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,319
the room and the amount of pollen that

936
00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:33,398
gets everywhere in the room and then I

937
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:34,839
look it looks like I've been doing

938
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:37,199
drywall work in there only it's got a

939
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:39,000
slightly yellow tinted drywall and I've

940
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,159
the amount of area that I have to clean

941
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,599
up is just ridiculous so I like to say

942
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,320
it was some for some really cool reason

943
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:46,839
but it really just saves me work yeah I

944
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:49,119
know how it is I've had some grow tents

945
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:51,278
that you know yellow sides and it gets

946
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:52,959
tough with the ventilation socks are and

947
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,440
they like you know come in and getting

948
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,840
every single nook and cranny it's it's

949
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,519
difficult so I hear you on that one so

950
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:03,519
so are you collecting pollen from the

951
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,278
Reversed plant and putting into a

952
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,519
container and then doing the paintbrush

953
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:09,918
process and also do you store pollen at

954
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,559
all yeah I do it live in real time so I

955
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,759
don't ever store any of it I've had had

956
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,838
you know there's a reason there's no

957
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,560
company that just sells pollen it just

958
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:21,279
doesn't it once it leaves the plant its

959
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:23,398
life is cycle is is not greatest like

960
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,359
they don't handle like can you imagine

961
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:27,398
if you if you were like just brought up

962
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:28,480
a company they would be 100% legal you

963
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,759
could ship sh it everywhere just

964
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,358
feminized pollen the amount of money you

965
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,839
can make it just doesn't survive very

966
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:37,398
well the shipping process and I've

967
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:39,320
always just live timed it to where my

968
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:41,598
males were ready around the time that I

969
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,440
need my females ready because even if

970
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,119
the plant is dropping pollen you don't

971
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,480
have to collect it right away like let's

972
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,838
say your female isn't ready you can just

973
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,000
leave it on that plant yeah it'll be

974
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:51,239
spilling stuff onto the leaves and stuff

975
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,519
but you can literally just leave it on

976
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:54,918
the plant and then wait your extra half

977
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,000
week or week cuz you shouldn't be that

978
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:58,960
far off and then collect the pollen and

979
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,599
then put it on there so you know I can

980
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,079
use the the male or the feminized female

981
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:05,920
as kind of like a little storage locker

982
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,079
for it and then livetime collect it and

983
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:12,039
then immediately use it I just never had

984
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:13,920
the best luck uh with like trying to

985
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:16,559
store it or anything like that so I just

986
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,039
always live time it got it and then one

987
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,799
other thing that is vastly different

988
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:22,400
from just growing the pl naturally is

989
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,200
the length of time you're actually

990
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,838
growing the plant right so you're not

991
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:26,759
looking for a specific Harvest window

992
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:29,159
you're not really looking at the

993
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,720
tricomes to see y okay they're ready to

994
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:32,598
harvest right you're letting it go

995
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,879
longer than that in order for those

996
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:37,039
seeds to develop how long do you

997
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,280
typically let a plant grow until you

998
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:39,800
harvest the seeds now I know that's

999
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,480
probably going to vary depending if you

1000
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,519
have an eight weer nine weer so on and

1001
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,719
so forth but generally speaking how much

1002
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:47,440
longer is the plant growing until you

1003
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:50,239
harvest the seeds I always tell

1004
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,400
everybody it's it's around 7 to eight

1005
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:53,479
weeks from pollination date so I always

1006
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,119
tell everybody you're pretty much

1007
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,039
restarting your flower the day you

1008
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,318
pollinate them and what I always tell

1009
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:02,199
everybody is the second we pollinate

1010
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:04,719
them we no longer look at the tricomes

1011
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:07,000
for when our Harvest is done now we

1012
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,598
actually use the seeds as our like kind

1013
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,079
of like our triome markers because they

1014
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:13,200
go through color stages just like the

1015
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:14,560
tricomes do they'll start off green then

1016
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,919
they'll turn to White then they'll turn

1017
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:20,599
to gray then they go brown with Tiger

1018
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:22,599
stripes and you can they're never all

1019
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:24,160
going to be on the same page so we do it

1020
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,160
just like we do with our tricomes we're

1021
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:28,199
basing off of what's the majority of

1022
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:30,719
what we're looking at on the plant at

1023
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:32,199
this time is kind of how we dictate with

1024
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:34,399
when the plant comes down so if I'm

1025
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:36,039
looking and I'm like H we got the

1026
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,920
majority green we know we're way far

1027
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:41,400
away and then you know we come back a

1028
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:44,599
few weeks okay the majority is white

1029
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,880
with a minority of gray like okay and

1030
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,480
now the the pods are starting to split

1031
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,358
open on the top which we get a really

1032
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,440
good view of when we can start watching

1033
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:53,920
them because the tops of the pods they

1034
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,318
actually split open like this and you

1035
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,240
get a really good view window right on

1036
00:36:55,318 --> 00:37:01,800
the top of them on how they're doing but

1037
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:04,078
as soon as I see where the majority are

1038
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,119
brown and tiger striped and there's a

1039
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,599
minority of gray that's whenever I chop

1040
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:10,680
down so it's just a based on visually

1041
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:12,599
whenever I look over the plant what do

1042
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:14,078
they look like they're doing right now

1043
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:15,240
and that's you know it's the same way

1044
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,318
whenever you're looking at

1045
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:18,598
tricomes the plant functions the same

1046
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:22,800
way it lets you know when it's ready to

1047
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:24,680
chop got it and so you are really ju

1048
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,240
Cree femin seeds correct me if I'm wrong

1049
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:29,039
there I do occasional RS but not many

1050
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:32,078
okay so you're focusing on feminized in

1051
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:35,159
order to actually get feminized seeds

1052
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,680
you have to basically reverse a plant

1053
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:38,480
that is already growing as a female you

1054
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:41,239
reverse it and then all of a sudden it

1055
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,280
starts creating pollen sacks and then

1056
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:45,399
releasing pollen let's talk about the

1057
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,760
way you reverse plants there's a couple

1058
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,200
different ways you can do it there's

1059
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,800
clodo silver there's STS some people

1060
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:53,919
combine the two what's your process for

1061
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,760
reversing the plant so I've done all

1062
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,200
three of those I've done just colloidal

1063
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,400
silver I've done just St spray and then

1064
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:03,519
I've done done the combo of the two so

1065
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,039
I've done all of them you know multiple

1066
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:07,599
and multiple times and I've always found

1067
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:10,119
that the combo of both has got me the

1068
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:13,760
best results as far as pollen production

1069
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:15,280
is what I'm looking for um because like

1070
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,079
with the colloid I have the least

1071
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,319
effective way with colloidal silver I

1072
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:21,079
get a lot of plants that will they'll

1073
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:22,920
make the sacks and then the sacks will

1074
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:28,440
be empty there won't be any pollen in

1075
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:29,960
them and it's literally only the main

1076
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,000
problem with that one is just with the

1077
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:34,159
colloidal silver and run into that

1078
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,159
occasionally with STS spray not as often

1079
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:38,519
but I've always found that whenever I do

1080
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:40,679
the combo of both of them

1081
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:42,559
together I usually have really really

1082
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:44,679
good results as far as pollen production

1083
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,358
of the plants and the amount of sites

1084
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:48,039
that I get to collect it from so for

1085
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:50,318
clodo silver C fromong you're supposed

1086
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:53,079
to be spaying once a day some people do

1087
00:38:50,318 --> 00:38:55,800
it multiple times a day to spay the

1088
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:57,519
plant for the first what is it two weeks

1089
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,760
or three weeks or something like that

1090
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:02,679
three weeks is what yeah so yeah if in

1091
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,960
the parts per million they they come in

1092
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:05,559
different parts per million you can make

1093
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,119
your own colloidal silver too it's not a

1094
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:10,400
terribly hard process but the minimum I

1095
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:12,720
found that works is 30 parts per million

1096
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,200
but I found kind of like the sweet spot

1097
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:17,959
right around the 50ish parts per million

1098
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:20,039
and then if like if all I had was cido

1099
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,800
silver it's three times a day from the

1100
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:25,079
last week of veg through the first two

1101
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:27,039
weeks of flow and then I cut it and then

1102
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:29,440
that gives us enough time because the p

1103
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:31,358
the tree or the plant should be dropping

1104
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,480
its pollen around week three to three

1105
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:35,358
and A2 of flour which puts you right on

1106
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,400
where you're normally would be attacking

1107
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:40,039
your females with it so and then if

1108
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,039
you're using STS STS is a little bit

1109
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:44,079
more I say hands off but less work to

1110
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:47,759
where you're only spraying once every

1111
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:50,519
five days which I've tried before and uh

1112
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,520
unfortunately quite recently actually it

1113
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:54,079
didn't reverse you know the plant didn't

1114
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:55,519
actually reverse it was like what the

1115
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,839
heck I planted all around this and it

1116
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:00,079
didn't actually work yeah so the with

1117
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:03,599
the STS spray I found that once every 5

1118
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:05,318
days is a little bit long for them so

1119
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,838
and then the time frame slightly off too

1120
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:09,199
so you have to account for that whenever

1121
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:11,719
you're doing your females so whenever

1122
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:13,799
I'm doing whenever I'm going to make the

1123
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:15,679
male version of the female plant and I'm

1124
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,839
going to use just STS spray I actually

1125
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,838
start them into their flour a week or

1126
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:21,480
two earlier than the other plants go

1127
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:24,960
into flour because whenever you're doing

1128
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:28,199
just STS spray it's once every 5 days

1129
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:31,079
for the first 30 days of flour so you

1130
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:33,480
can still be spraying four weeks and if

1131
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:35,599
you stop there before the four weeks are

1132
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,280
up you can actually it'll end up with no

1133
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,800
pollen at all you won't even get the

1134
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,040
reversal so it's it's very important but

1135
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,240
I've dropped it down to every 3 to 4

1136
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:46,159
days that I'll do it and I'll just do it

1137
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:47,919
once a day right before the lights go

1138
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:49,960
off you know it's a big thing is the

1139
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,800
light actually damages the STS spray and

1140
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,639
then whenever you're combining it if you

1141
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,680
don't combine it in the

1142
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:58,039
right uh order which there's only two

1143
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:59,799
parts but if you put it in wrong and you

1144
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:02,159
don't get that cool fizzy reaction that

1145
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,760
happens in it and if you don't get it

1146
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:06,639
that right or if you add it too fast it

1147
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:09,079
actually will make it inert and uh you

1148
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:10,159
have to watch for the Fizz so you want

1149
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:12,039
to keep it just to where it keeps

1150
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:13,679
fizzing on itself and then you know

1151
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:15,838
you're doing it right interesting yeah

1152
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,799
I'll have to go back and try doing both

1153
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:19,480
the combo like you mentioned in order to

1154
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,318
try to get a better result there the

1155
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:24,280
combo's great so whenever it's a combo I

1156
00:41:21,318 --> 00:41:27,679
kind of switch it up so for the last two

1157
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,720
weeks of EG I'll do just STS spray for

1158
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:31,838
once every 3 days and then whenever we

1159
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:33,919
switch into flour I switch over C

1160
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:35,880
colloidal silver and I spray it once or

1161
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,318
I spray it three times every day for the

1162
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,519
first two weeks which is the literally

1163
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:41,719
the worst part of the grow that I have

1164
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:44,440
to go into there three times a day every

1165
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:45,639
single day Monday through Sunday you

1166
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,200
gotta do what you got to do in order to

1167
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:48,559
get that reversal right you gotta do

1168
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:50,358
what you got to do it's my least

1169
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:52,000
favorite part though I'm just like H and

1170
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:53,679
it's not like it's it's crazy hard but

1171
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,838
it's just my finger gets tired cuz I

1172
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:56,239
have like you know the pump sprayer

1173
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:58,159
bottle like this because you don't need

1174
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,719
a ton of it and you can go through it

1175
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:01,559
way too fast when you have like the big

1176
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:03,279
spray bottles so I just have this little

1177
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:04,599
spray bottle and my my it's my hand just

1178
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,240
gets tired of spraying all the different

1179
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:08,880
branches so and you had mentioned that

1180
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:11,118
you only reverse a branch or two you're

1181
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,358
not reversing the entire plant it

1182
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,200
depends it depends on how much I need so

1183
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:17,199
the biggest thing uh especially because

1184
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:19,318
you can run into problems where you

1185
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:21,719
don't get any pollen from the pollen SE

1186
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:23,759
or they don't reverse so if let's say

1187
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:26,000
I'm trying to pollinate six plants I'll

1188
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,599
grow nine and I have three different

1189
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,559
plants that I'll pull into a different

1190
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,760
tent to reverse just because I I want to

1191
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:35,880
weigh out my I don't ever just put all

1192
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,599
my chips on one because I don't store

1193
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:41,800
pollen so I will grow extra plants just

1194
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,000
to have backups in case you know hey

1195
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,720
that one what if something happens what

1196
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,920
if a fan falls on it and breaks it and

1197
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:48,799
kills it and now I have nothing because

1198
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,280
now I have no males that are or females

1199
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,920
that are anywhere close to being ready

1200
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,119
to reverse and so I always just have

1201
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,200
backups on backups whenever I'm getting

1202
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,400
ready to you know go through that proc

1203
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,639
process cuz I want to make sure that if

1204
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,079
I want to make a line like oh no this

1205
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:04,920
didn't reverse or I didn't get as much

1206
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:06,240
pollen as I wanted which is never

1207
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,920
usually the case but it does

1208
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:10,159
occasionally happen but I always have

1209
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,480
backups on backups just in case but it

1210
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:15,358
makes me go through a lot of colloidal

1211
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:18,760
silver and sdn and STS spray though got

1212
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:20,358
it safe sided right yeah exactly because

1213
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,200
know maybe if I had a giant store room

1214
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:24,719
and the pollen stayed really well it' be

1215
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:26,239
one thing but I just don't like the

1216
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:28,078
staying power of the pollen once it

1217
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,078
leaves the plant so I just make sure I

1218
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:32,480
have plenty of females on deck that are

1219
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,880
giving me pollen got it so we talked

1220
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,639
about the reversal process we talked

1221
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,400
about really growing the plants you know

1222
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:42,118
the nutrition you use container size how

1223
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,838
long you're letting the plants grow when

1224
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:47,400
you're pollinating now what's your

1225
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:48,960
process for getting seeds tested right

1226
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,880
uh you know an ethical thing to do would

1227
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,838
be before releasing to the public would

1228
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,640
be to get them tested yeah what's your

1229
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:57,960
process for that well I actually have a

1230
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:59,799
beta tester program built into my

1231
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,679
patreon and then on top of it is you

1232
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,519
know I never sell anything so all my

1233
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:06,639
stuff all the stuff I make I give away

1234
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:09,440
completely free to the people in my

1235
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:12,239
patreon I don't ever charge for it so I

1236
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,838
have a huge sampling audience that does

1237
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:15,279
a lot of testing for like hey we like

1238
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:17,199
this hey we don't like this these are

1239
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,240
the germination rates that we got these

1240
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:22,039
are you know like of the ones that that

1241
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:24,159
came up this is what we're having with

1242
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:27,480
it and I know before it even ever goes

1243
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:29,799
out to the mass of the patreon because I

1244
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,760
have a a b tester program that helps me

1245
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,559
with the testing of them and we go

1246
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,520
through a pretty extensive back and

1247
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:37,920
forth with everything we're seeing and

1248
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:40,559
then when it goes out to the patreon I

1249
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,480
get this huge you know envelopment of

1250
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:45,359
information from Growers of all styles

1251
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,719
whether they're doing Hydro or whether

1252
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:49,519
they're doing any kind of media based or

1253
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:52,000
whether they're new or very expert

1254
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:53,880
Growers I get this just this huge

1255
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,079
information dumps every time and every

1256
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,000
time I release a line I just feel like

1257
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,160
it makes me a better and better grower

1258
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,599
and what I'm trying to do kind of refine

1259
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:04,000
the process every single time we do a

1260
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:06,119
drop and I mean I've got to the point

1261
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,960
now where I'm doing usually five to six

1262
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:12,760
new drops per year so it it works out

1263
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,880
pretty well and uh dude the patreons are

1264
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:17,480
awesome I mean they're just they're such

1265
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,280
they're such great people

1266
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,358
and I just I really am thankful for this

1267
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,400
community and what it's done for my life

1268
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:26,119
it's it's amazing and I really love

1269
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,760
interacting with the people of this of

1270
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:29,079
this community every day so it's been

1271
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,839
great sounds like you have a great

1272
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:33,680
support system over there I know a lot

1273
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:36,000
of folks breeders in particular who look

1274
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:38,440
for testers or have testers some of them

1275
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,039
just ghost like when I first sent out

1276
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,240
the chill at OG that cross that I made

1277
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:45,159
testers 80% of the people just didn't

1278
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:46,558
even respond after respond you never

1279
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:48,239
know yeah you never know what happened I

1280
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,079
got nothing from them and I was looking

1281
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:51,519
for the feedback so sounds like you got

1282
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,599
some pretty stable stuff over there on

1283
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:56,318
the patreon side of things yeah we built

1284
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,240
a pretty in you know amazing Discord

1285
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:59,079
that I actually had turn the

1286
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:00,598
notifications off because it it's you

1287
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:02,079

1288
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:04,240
in there some of the best Growers I've

1289
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,760
ever seen and the feedback and the

1290
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:09,838
picture up you know I it's livetime real

1291
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:12,359
pictures every new line has its very own

1292
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:14,000
dedicated you know browser section to it

1293
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:15,440
and you know you can just sit there and

1294
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,280
look at the progress and see what kind

1295
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,159
of if people are having problems or the

1296
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,160
luck or the different tpine profiles

1297
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:22,838
that we're having through there it's

1298
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:26,279
it's been great like oh this one's super

1299
00:46:22,838 --> 00:46:28,078
Menthol or this one's this it's it's

1300
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,559
it's really great to get that kind of

1301
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:33,200
feedback on something that you're making

1302
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:34,519
to have thousands of people all doing it

1303
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:37,159
usually whenever I release it they all

1304
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:39,519
are planning at the same time to have

1305
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:42,039
that kind of feedback and

1306
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:45,280
information instantly back on it it's

1307
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:46,679
it's been great so that's awesome so

1308
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,160
what advice do you have for those that

1309
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:51,118
are just getting into breeding don't

1310
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:54,960
trace hype would probably be my number

1311
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:57,720
one and figure out what you like first

1312
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,280
and think of the reasons you're doing it

1313
00:46:57,719 --> 00:47:00,358
you know the main one would be think of

1314
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,519
the reasons you're doing it and don't

1315
00:47:00,358 --> 00:47:07,039
chase the hype um I think you'll find if

1316
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:09,960
you you go after what you like uh the

1317
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:11,558
process won't become arduous or like

1318
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,119
work because you're going actually enjoy

1319
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:15,839
doing it because Crossing things you

1320
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:17,559
know it's it's not a ton of work it

1321
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:19,519
depends on what you're doing but it's

1322
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:22,480
definitely more work especially if

1323
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:24,039
you're reversing and feminizing and then

1324
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,599
getting all the seeds if you don't have

1325
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:27,279
the cool machines that do it for you

1326
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:29,119
it's a lot of work to pick all them

1327
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,760
freaking seeds out of there I think

1328
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,000
that's some really good advice there is

1329
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,720
one more question I wanted to ask you

1330
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,880
that wasn't actually on the list which

1331
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:38,799
is talking about hype chasing the hype

1332
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,400
there's a lot of hype around triploids

1333
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,440
right now what are your thoughts on

1334
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,800
triploids got a lot of I got a lot of

1335
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,838
heat I got a lot of people that agreed

1336
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,000
with me and then I got a lot of heat

1337
00:47:44,838 --> 00:47:49,599
from it I think my view on it is just

1338
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,800
maybe jaded because you know I grew up

1339
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:55,400
in the midwest so uh I was watched a lot

1340
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,440
of my friends families really get messed

1341
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:01,400
over with not reproducing seeds and

1342
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,838
stuff like that so for the new Growers I

1343
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:06,358
think they're fantastic

1344
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:09,279
for I don't I just I'm not a you know

1345
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:11,400
I'm not a fan personally but for new

1346
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,839
Growers for something that won't seed or

1347
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:16,119
Herm I once again I think it's a crutch

1348
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:17,358
but I understand why you would like them

1349
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:19,559
I think it's the same thing as like when

1350
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:21,000
Autos first came out you know there like

1351
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:22,559
oh you don't have to switch them over

1352
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,039
they do switch over to flower all by

1353
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:27,200
themselves not that hard to switch a

1354
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:29,759
timer but you know I'm a photo period

1355
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:31,519
guy so it just it's not one of my

1356
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,599
favorite things but I do understand why

1357
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,599
people would like them especially where

1358
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:38,200
they you know they won't make seeds no

1359
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:40,039
matter how bad you treat them I would

1360
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:41,439
rather just become a slightly better

1361
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:42,800
grower so I didn't worry about herming

1362
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,318
my stuff that's going to get me in

1363
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,559
trouble anyway I got I got a lot of hate

1364
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:48,440
from that video I got a lot lot of great

1365
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,599
views on it but I did get a lot of hate

1366
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:53,079
from that video yeah the video I'm

1367
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:55,119
looking on your page right now the

1368
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:57,798
dangers of triploids and the problems

1369
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:01,039
coming 31,000

1370
00:48:57,798 --> 00:49:02,159
views to click I clicked on it I listen

1371
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:03,719
to you and you you brought up some good

1372
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:05,078
points in there now you mentioned that

1373
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:06,798
they they're not supposed to Herm right

1374
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:08,640
so like yeah unfortunately we're not

1375
00:49:06,798 --> 00:49:11,199
they're not seeing that now like there's

1376
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:14,078
a we've got the the donuts triploid from

1377
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:15,798
Humbolt people reporting Herms you know

1378
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,680
people reporting Herms happening there

1379
00:49:15,798 --> 00:49:21,798
which like to hear they not supposed to

1380
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:24,199
but we're are seeing it so yeah that

1381
00:49:21,798 --> 00:49:25,759
that makes me sad you know CU like I

1382
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:27,000
understood like how cool that could be

1383
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,400
especially for new Growers like you

1384
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,639
don't have to worry about this herming I

1385
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,200
understood the point of it and I

1386
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:36,000
understood the appeal of it uh at the

1387
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:37,919
same time that's like as a new grower I

1388
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,920
would want people

1389
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,680
to treat you know I would want you to

1390
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,280
treat the cold not just the cough like

1391
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,558
why are you coughing why is this plant

1392
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,240
doing this oh no we're just going to

1393
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:48,798
make a plant that doesn't do it yeah but

1394
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:50,318
you'll get better results in the long

1395
00:49:48,798 --> 00:49:52,599
run if you figure out why this is

1396
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:54,679
happening what stressor are you doing to

1397
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:57,160
it that's causing it to

1398
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:59,318
harm and that's just crazy cuz that's

1399
00:49:57,159 --> 00:50:01,798
that was supposed to be a plant that

1400
00:49:59,318 --> 00:50:04,759
just genetically wasn't allowed wouldn't

1401
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:07,280
been allowed to make seeds life findes

1402
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,160
