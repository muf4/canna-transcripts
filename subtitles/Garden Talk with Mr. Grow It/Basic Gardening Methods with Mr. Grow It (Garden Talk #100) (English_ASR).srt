1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,559
coming up on Garden talk my goal with

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,719
Organic is to keep the medium moist at

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,339
all times that way the microbes are

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,679
continuing to be active if the soil

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:12,419
dries out microbes go dormant you don't

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,099
get that breakdown of those amendments

7
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:16,198
turning them into usable nutrients for

8
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,118
the plants a little sponge at the bottom

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,400
and a little little container there so

10
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:22,198
you basically wet the sponge and then

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,599
keep it on the bottom rack there and

12
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,539
that helps hold the proper humidity in

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,699
there mix it up within the top inch or

14
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,300
so of the soil it's pretty much like

15
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,460
glass shards to these pests towards the

16
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,599
end of flowering I'll lower the temps in

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,000
order to try to conserve the the

18
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,079
terpenes have less terpenes volatizing

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,479
off the plant

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,340
don't get caught up in the noise there

21
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,738
are a million ways to go about growing

22
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,260
these plants there are some content

23
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:50,699
creators out there that say it's their

24
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:52,679
way or the highway they have the best

25
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,320
way to do it and everybody else is doing

26
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,979
things wrong and that's just so far from

27
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,980
the truth

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,359
what's up everybody if you that don't

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,680

00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:44,699
questions lined up for you brother

103
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,919
um to go through and kind of figure out

104

who is Mr Grow it who's Chris your

105
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:50,699
history what got you to the point where

106
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,019
you are here today but before we get

107
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:54,060
into those questions bro I kind of

108
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,039
wanted to ask you what was the purpose

109
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,120
or what brought this episode up for the

110
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,239
100th episode

111
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,200
me interviewing you on your channel why

112
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,140
are we here

113
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,000
well it was actually viewer requested so

114
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,318
over you know the past couple years

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,419
since I've been doing this podcast

116
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:10,798
there's been a large handful of people

117
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:13,259
that are like hey how about you get

118
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,700
interviewed for an episode and uh you

119
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:16,680
know I thought about it you know I

120
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,120
agreed to do it it just I wasn't sure

121
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,280
when I want to do it and I figured hey

122
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,560
100th episode I think that's the perfect

123
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,138
timing to do it and then as far as

124
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,079
bringing you on there was a few people

125
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,519
who I had in mind for uh actually being

126
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,500
the one to interview me I thought about

127
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,478
like interviewing myself but I'm like ah

128
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,120
it's gonna be blind let me let me bring

129
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:38,219
somebody else on to ask me questions and

130
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,079
you know we did an episode together I

131
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,180
forget what episode that was but uh look

132
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,800
back uh you'll see the episode with him

133
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,840
and then we also did a live stream on

134
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,759
your channel and both of those I feel

135
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,819
like just flowed so well I mean we have

136
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,100
real good chemistry and uh yeah I think

137
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:55,740
it I think you would be one of the best

138
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,199
if not the best person to ask the

139
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,418
questions follow-up questions all that

140
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,580
stuff to kind of get the most out of me

141
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:04,319
dude much love and thank you for that

142
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:05,819
and if I could throw it back if there's

143
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,099
anyone I could sit down to interview

144
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:09,599
especially on their channel it's most

145
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,879
certainly Mr Grow it Chris like you've

146
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,259
made such an impact on all of us you're

147
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,478
listening to the podcast that we're not

148
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,800
listening to right now so I say we jump

149
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:18,240
right into it brother because we got a

150
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,860
lot to talk about and this is again this

151
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,800
is the moment where we actually get to

152
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,240
know Chris The Man Behind the Mr grower

153
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,740
Channel and obviously the garden Talk

154
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,019
podcast

155
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,759
so the first question brother tell us a

156
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:31,978
little bit about how you got into

157
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,439
gardening a little bit about me and how

158
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:36,019
I got into gardening I was born and

159
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:40,560
raised outside of Boston Massachusetts

160
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:43,099
so a little town about 15 minutes north

161
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,720
of Boston called Billerica Massachusetts

162
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,360
and my first memory of gardening was

163
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,220
actually with my grandparents so super

164
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,400
young I remember being out in the garden

165
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,800
and picking carrots baby carrots with

166
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:57,839
them and uh you know washing them off

167
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,478
and eating them and them they tasting so

168
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,099
good and uh you know rest in peace

169
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,199
neither one of my grandparents on that

170
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,720
side of the family are with us anymore

171
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,759
but that's a memory that I'm gonna have

172
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,620
forever you know it's not only carrots

173
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,538
but they had lettuce some peppers

174
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,740
tomatoes so it was like a full-blown

175
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:16,800
Garden

176
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,660
um so it was my first memory ever of me

177
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,780
gardening you know and then when I was

178
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,919
about 14 or 15 that's when uh you know I

179
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:26,219
was consuming at the time I started

180
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:27,959
consuming when I was 12 and then uh 14

181
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,360
or 15 years old when I really started

182
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:32,459
researching on how to grow I didn't

183
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,379
attempt it yet but I was on the forearms

184
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:36,359
researching trying to figure out how to

185
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:38,459
do it because I was tired of spending

186
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,199
money on it it's like grow my own you

187
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:41,758
know what I mean so I started

188
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,500
researching it and then it was until I

189
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,900
was like 15 or 16 when I started my

190
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,478
first grow and me and my buddies we went

191
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:51,000
oh deep into the woods and there was a

192
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,519
stream and there was like moist soil

193
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,379
next to the stream and sun was on that

194
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,139
spot and I'm like it's got to be a good

195
00:06:55,379 --> 00:07:00,538
spot you know this this sun it's moist

196
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,400
let's plant the seeds so Gorilla Grow

197
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:05,818
style like Jorge Cervantes would be

198
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,439
proud huh yeah yeah so we planted that

199
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:10,080
came back months later and it's like

200
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,579
tall spindly spindly plants like no buds

201
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,680
on them whatever we had no idea what we

202
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:15,060
were doing it was so laughable looking

203
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,819
back it's like and then we just

204
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,019
abandoned it from there it was it was so

205
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:23,280
funny

206
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:25,198
um but really in 2007 to 2009 that's

207
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,478
when my friends started growing I was

208
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,759
watching them grow you know they had

209
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,680
indoor grows outdoor grows and I

210
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,360
remember seeing the the Fox Farm

211
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,280
nutrients bottles for the first time

212
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,199
it's all these are cool logos what are

213
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,698
these what do you these are nutrients oh

214
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,098
how often do you feed you know just

215
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,840
picking my friend's brain on how to grow

216
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:45,959
the plants and then I started my first

217
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:48,598
grow in 2010. I remember I grew uh it

218
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:50,818
was like skunk number one nycity diesel

219
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:53,519
strawberry cough and I think Northern

220
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,439
Lights if I remember correctly and uh

221
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,198
yeah that's that's how I first got

222
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,279
started unreal bro and just touching on

223
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,020
like what you just said out of those

224
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,879
like line up classic strains which are

225
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:04,318
so classic now what was one of those

226
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,759
first ones that stood out to you like

227
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,439
from the Northern Lights the strawberry

228
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,259
cough and those wizard one like of that

229
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,639
first Gardener you know Young Chris you

230
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,080
know his first Garden was there one that

231
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,800
stood out to you right up right off the

232
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,959
bat

233
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,360
it had been the skunk number one just

234
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,279
because of the smell was just it was so

235
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,038
skunky right I mean that that it's in

236
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:25,739
its name it was just super powerful

237
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,719
smell uh and flavor as well

238
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,860
yes yeah no doubt everything that he

239
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,660
used to cross but then in the future

240
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,158
that strain I get where you're coming

241
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,538
from on that one dude

242
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,580
so that's where you started obviously

243
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:37,379
like Gorilla Grow Style

244
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,639
not many of us got our start with like

245
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:40,799
really growing and eventually like

246
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:44,278
getting our own setup into that but like

247
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,199
from then till now like what's what kind

248
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:48,838
of like style are you working with now

249
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,580
with your girl well back then when I

250
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,459
kind of first started growing I was

251
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:56,040
using the fox farm ocean forest soil Fox

252
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:57,239
Farm Trio of nutrients and HID lighting

253
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,039
which is what my friends were using

254
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,959
right so might as well you know get

255
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,458
mentored by them do what they're doing

256
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,679
because they were doing it successfully

257
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:06,958
I remember with the HID lighting back

258
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:09,539
then man it was like I had the cool

259
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:12,719
tubes and Wing reflectors came after

260
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:14,278
that and then that air cooled Hood which

261
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,019
I'm probably speaking another language

262
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:17,879
for a lot of the newer Growers out there

263
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,440
like what the heck is that basically the

264
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,139
Cool Tube was like a tube and you had

265
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,640
like a there's like six inch reflectors

266
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:25,199
I think on each side or something like

267
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:26,580
that and then the wing reflectors this

268
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,259
big wing and then the air colds were

269
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,639
game changers because you had the

270
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:31,679
ducting connecting it was just pulling

271
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,240
the heat out of there that's really what

272
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,299
I started with and I switched over to

273
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,980
LEDs in 2015. my first led I don't think

274
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:41,879
I'll ever forget it is the Platinum LED

275
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,278
P9 xml2 really really good light for

276
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,439
back then they're actually it's so funny

277
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:48,600
they're still selling that light today I

278
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,339
looked online recently I'm like what the

279
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,899
heck is so like not not the best company

280
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,180
you know selling all the older

281
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:56,820
technology and there's they're also

282
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:58,639
selling like therapy lights now which I

283
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,320
thought was so funny

284
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,819
yeah what like what are people using

285
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,040
these therapy lights I don't even know

286
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,379
man I didn't look too deep into it but

287
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,179
uh they switched from indoor grow lights

288
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:12,539
to therapy lights which I thought was

289
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:14,458
that was pretty funny but yeah LED and

290
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:15,958
then the Fox Farm nutrients I got some

291
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,338
really good results with that lineup I

292
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,679
used it for you know five six seven

293
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,720
years just the trio

294
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,458
I also was using the Beastie blooms

295
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,080
which is their PK booster because

296
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,759
oftentimes I would get phosphorus

297
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,920
deficiency in the middle flowering and

298
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,019
that PK booster did help and then when I

299
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:33,838
switched over to the LED grow lights I

300
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,580
had added calmag into my regimen so um

301
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,899
that's kind of where I started there and

302
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,480
then kind of

303
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:42,899
where I'm going now I mean I I'm fully

304
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,759
over with LED I have been using I've

305
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,559
used so many LED grow lights over the

306
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,659
years it's it's I can't even remember

307
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,778
them all right now I'm using the AC

308
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:54,000
Infinity t24s I have two of those and I

309
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:56,399
have two t22s

310
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,220
and I've used Viper Specter in the past

311
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,379
Mars Hydro spider farmer the list goes

312
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,379
on I was actually doing par testing for

313
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:06,899
a while I had companies send me lights

314
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:08,519
and I would test them out and show with

315
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,980
the par meter what they were doing for

316
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,539
for par numbers and posting videos on

317
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,339
that I got bored of that and stopped

318
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:16,439
doing that but I did have an interest in

319
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:19,500
lighting for for quite some time there

320
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,019
and then as far as medium you know I've

321
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,820
tried Coco in the past I had some great

322
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:27,179
really great results with it but I

323
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:30,300
really still prefer growing in soil and

324
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:32,639
I have transitioned over to organic but

325
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:34,500
I still do synthetic grows or you know

326
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,778
to be politically correct for a lot of

327
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,839
people there's a mineral based grows

328
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:42,120
from time to time but yeah my main focus

329
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,000
in recent years has been growing

330
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,620
organically wow and before we continue

331
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,078
because like again we're talking to

332
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,480
someone right now guys that has spoken

333
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:53,099
to so many experts right there's been a

334
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,839
hundred episodes on the channel but that

335
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,278
I can only imagine how many more experts

336
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,899
you've spoken to again going to MJ

337
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:59,879
bizcon in different places in different

338
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,860
areas so how much of what you've learned

339
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:03,419
from the very beginning as it grows

340
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,039
Chris at the very beginning to again

341
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:06,958
your gross style that you've kind of

342
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,759
explained to us now how much of your

343
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,239
interviews and the experts that you've

344
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:14,639
known have molded that compared to you

345
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,259
just making your own decisions man it's

346
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,419
hard to explain I've done so much stuff

347
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:21,000
differently since talking to people it's

348
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:23,159
crazy I mean I remember when you would

349
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,899
hear about when the leaves you know

350
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,759
pluck off leaves or leaves fall off and

351
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:28,139
it's at the top of the soil people

352
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,659
saying that's bad you need to

353
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:32,220
immediately remove those leaves from the

354
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:35,219
top of the medium because it attracts

355
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,259
pests and you know come to find out fast

356
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,000
forward now organic Growers they do that

357
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:41,039
purposely they do that it's called The

358
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,139
Chop and drop method they're chopping

359
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,899
things down dropping it onto the soil

360
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:47,820
uses mulch help retain the water also

361
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,799
that breaks down and microbes break it

362
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,320
down cycle the nutrients the plant can

363
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:53,879
uptake those nutrients there's I mean an

364
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,240
endless amount of things that I used to

365
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:59,278
do that I've changed because of what I

366
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,259
learned through talking with people you

367
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,360
know you're watching YouTube videos or

368
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:05,939
talking with people on my podcast so

369
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,339
yeah it's always changing always trying

370
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,380
to improve when it comes to what I do in

371
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,180
the garden yeah that must be the battle

372
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:13,500
with you and me as an active listener to

373
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:15,359
the podcast and everything you do it's

374
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,679
like oh my God one week we might be

375
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,060
talking about Organics and the next week

376
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:19,799
you're talking about maybe synthetics

377
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:21,659
and you're talking about everything on

378
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,819
the scale which you as like a grower

379
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:25,919
yourself as well you must have internal

380
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,019
battles all the time like okay okay and

381
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,699
so my my question is like

382
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,019
when you hear someone again like Dr

383
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,339
Bruce bugbee someone with so much

384
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,480
certification coming on your show and

385
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,120
telling you this is the studies that's

386
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,399
what I've heard do you take these

387
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,959
professionals and their advice as like

388
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,458
that's law that's what I'm gonna do are

389
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,739
you taking this as like I'm gonna test

390
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:46,379
this and then apply it and continue to

391
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,299
use it with your own personal stuff I

392
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:50,399
definitely take into consideration and I

393
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:52,379
say them as a source when I'm talking to

394
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,899
other people about what they have

395
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:57,240
discussed but science is repeatable

396
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:59,759
right so like there might be one study

397
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,180
on it but there needs to be more studies

398
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,519
on it in order for it to be proven as a

399
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:07,078
fact so I just keep that in mind because

400
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,600
I know for example there's a study on

401
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:11,759
flushing out there and people are you

402
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,339
know there's this one study and people

403
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,860
are saying okay this is it this is fact

404
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,660
yet there's only been one study there

405
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,639
needs to be multiple studies on it doing

406
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:23,578
with the same result

407
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,740
repeatable in order for it to really say

408
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:27,958
that this works this doesn't work I just

409
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,820
keep that in mind but yeah Dr Bruce

410
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:32,819
bugged me I mean he's incredible I mean

411
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,980
a lot of things that he says he's done

412
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,240
studies on you know uh Utah State

413
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,740
University a big shout out to them I'm

414
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,339
actually attending Utah State University

415
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:43,740
as my second year I am a part of his

416
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,959
cultivation certificate that he has

417
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,240
going on I got it last year and then I'm

418
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:50,338
taking it again this year but so much

419
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,959
good information on there you can only

420
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:54,480
learn so much on YouTube

421
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,458
but actual formal schooling you can

422
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,259
learn so much more especially when it

423
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,578
comes down to the nitty-gritty science

424
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:01,559
of things so that's something I really

425
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:03,778
enjoy it's not for everybody but

426
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,278
certainly I enjoy it dude good for you

427
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,139
and especially like looking up and

428
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,720
watching different channels on YouTube

429
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:11,220
or podcasts on on whatever platform you

430
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,920
listen to podcasts on

431
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,199
for listening to the people that like in

432
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,299
this case you Mr Grow at Chris for him

433
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:19,559
to be putting in the work and going and

434
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:21,240
like getting these certificates to

435
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,500
better your knowledge to better handle

436
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,600
the interviews that you're doing pull in

437
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,159
different experts again that's why

438
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,079
that's why I've been a subscriber for a

439
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,519
long time bro and it's really cool to

440
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,519
hear this from this side of the desk

441
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,440
like actually getting to ask you

442
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,419
um flipping it a little bit because

443
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,980
you've spoken to so many experts you've

444
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:39,838
you know obviously been implementing so

445
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,399
many different things in testing but you

446
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,980
probably still have your own preferences

447
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,259
when it comes to autoflowers or photo

448
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,100
periods so which one do you prefer and

449
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:50,338
why

450
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,980
photo period so I've grown uh I started

451
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:55,199
growing Autos in like 2015 and I've

452
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,879
grown about probably two dozen or so

453
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,759
maybe a little bit more autoflowers

454
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,259
since then and I really do prefer photo

455
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,120
period for a few different reasons

456
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:05,639
number one more control

457
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,399
I can veg the plants for as long as I

458
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:11,100
want flip to flour when it's the size I

459
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,198
want or the shape I want and I can delay

460
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,759
flowering if I come across any problems

461
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,859
right like a deficiency or maybe I have

462
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,139
a pest infestation I want to deal with

463
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,879
first before flipping over the flower so

464
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:24,899
I love the control off of photo periods

465
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:26,939
and then also my lights being on less so

466
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:29,639
being on a 12 12 light cycle when the

467
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,620
plants aren't flowering I prefer more

468
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,320
particularly because it works well with

469
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,539
my climate so I live in a very dry

470
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,079
climate very hot climate I'm in the

471
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:42,659
desert actually and I run my lights at

472
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,758
night so it usually comes on about 6 p.m

473
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:47,519
and then the 12 hour light cycle would

474
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:50,399
add 6 a.m you know in some areas you

475
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,860
actually get a benefit of lower energy

476
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,659
cost I don't think in my state that's

477
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,959
the case it's different state by state

478
00:16:54,659 --> 00:17:00,240
but as far as it being cooler at night

479
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:02,578
and you know when you have a girl rooms

480
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,699
on it heats up that grow space but when

481
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:06,720
I'm running my lights during the day

482
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:08,759
unfortunately it makes it more difficult

483
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,679
to control that heat and you know

484
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:13,259
temperatures rise up into the high 80s

485
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:16,500
it's touched 90 degrees before my grow

486
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:19,078
10 which is really not ideal so if I can

487
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,539
keep my lights off during the day I'm

488
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:23,519
happy so I I see that as a benefit for

489
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:25,980
me so I definitely prefer photo period

490
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,359
for those few reasons mostly I do not

491
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,039
blame you as a gardener we want to

492
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,298
control as many things as possible and

493
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,980
when they're starting to flowers

494
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:33,960
definitely one of them an important one

495
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,419
so there we have it guys photo period on

496
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,819
that so when it comes to photo period

497
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:41,759
are you more of a feminized guy or a

498
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:43,798
regular seed guy and why I gotta say

499
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,980
feminize just for the Peace of Mind

500
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:49,679
purpose I mostly grow from seed clones

501
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,179
I've done in the past I just I don't do

502
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,059
a Perpetual grow

503
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:55,860
in between grows there's a period of

504
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:57,178
downtime where I'm drying carrying stuff

505
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:59,279
like that I don't have any active plants

506
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:01,679
growing so I mostly grow from seeds and

507
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,798
I grow all different cultivars the max

508
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,140
plant I have here is 12. and I'll give

509
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,839
you an example so quite recently

510
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:13,080
actually within the past year or two I

511
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:15,359
planted 12 regular seeds and I vegged

512
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:17,460
them out I actually did get them DNA sex

513
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,959
tested I found out the result probably

514
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,759
like week three or something like that

515
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,200
so it wasn't too much time wasted but

516
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:24,538
out of those 12 regularly seeds that

517
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,519
planted only four of them ended up being

518
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:28,319
female so I had to kill off the

519
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:29,940
remainder so like luck of the draw

520
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,798
wasn't a really good ratio for male

521
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,298
female but that throws everything off

522
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:35,160
for me so just having like the peace of

523
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:37,319
mind with feminized seeds

524
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,538
that's just my personal preference

525
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:41,279
really got you especially I guess like

526
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:43,200
if you're planning for to fill up a four

527
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,298
by four four by eight or whatever it is

528
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,798
for your plant limits and especially

529
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:48,359
talking plant limits some of these are

530
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:49,558
going to be males so you know if you're

531
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:50,519
not looking to get into breeding I

532
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:53,099
totally get where you're coming from

533
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:55,440
there and have similar experience

534
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:57,298
dude on the last one with my regular run

535
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,340
we won't talk about it here now but at

536
00:18:57,298 --> 00:19:00,660
some point I gotta fill you in I'm

537
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,798
definitely sticking to the Femmes too

538
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,660
and I agree with you on that one brother

539
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:06,240
all right so Chris talk to us about

540
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,919
proper Plant Nutrition what do you

541
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,839
actually do with your plants to keep

542
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,538
them nice and healthy well really

543
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:14,279
depends on what I'm using for an input

544
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:16,859
right so I can break it down between

545
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,418
synthetic or mineral based grows and

546
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:21,240
then I'll talk about Organics after the

547
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:23,340
facts so with the synthetic bottle of

548
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,759
nutrients that I use typically I'll go

549
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:28,379
in a half dose to begin so a lot of

550
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:30,480
times I grow in a soil that has

551
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,160
nutrients already in it to begin so it's

552
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,900
already pre-charged with nutrients a lot

553
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,720
of people say so typically for the first

554
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,940
roughly 30 or 40 days of the plant's

555
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,279
life it's got enough nutrition in the

556
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,160
medium already to begin particularly in

557
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:46,139
soil is what I'm referring to so I don't

558
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,759
do any feedings the first 30-40 days and

559
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,280
then from there I'll start doing a half

560
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,500
dose of bottled nutrients according to

561
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,779
what it says on the feeding chart you

562
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,640
know I like to stick to the ratios we

563
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:58,558
know if this is an imbalance of

564
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,380
nutrients in the medium it could lock

565
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:05,279
out other nutrients for example so I do

566
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,419
stick with a half dose and then I do the

567
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:07,379
there's so many different ways to go

568
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:09,059
about it and I've done it so many

569
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,299
different ways but I typically stick to

570
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:14,940
like the water feed water feed technique

571
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:16,619
that is where you know when I feed the

572
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,640
next time the medium dries out I will

573
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:19,439
water

574
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,140
the next in time the medium dries out

575
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,940
I'll feed and then I repeat that and

576
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,740
then when I determine when to water it's

577
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,360
just old school technique that I still

578
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,740
do I started from the beginning and

579
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,058
still due to this day which is just

580
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,579
stick your finger in the top of the

581
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:35,099
medium if an inch down knuckle deep if

582
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:37,439
there's bone dry that's when I go in

583
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:38,939
there with the watering or feeding and

584
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,500
also lifting the the side of the grow

585
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,759
pot and checking the weight and stuff

586
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,720
like that because I don't use moisture

587
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,480
meters

588
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,500
so um that probably probably should I

589
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,419
mean that makes things a little bit

590
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,859
easier but as of right now I don't use

591
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:51,840
moisture meters

592
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:54,538
so that's basically it with synthetic

593
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,159
and then as far as organic I mostly use

594
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:58,919
the organic blends

595
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,960
so I will do an initial amending of the

596
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,600
blend one of my recent favorites have

597
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,538
been the build of soil craft blend so

598
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:08,639
before I even plant into the medium I

599
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:11,579
will amend in the Bill of soil craft

600
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,799
blend one cup per plant and then roughly

601
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:15,779
about 30 days into the grill I'll do

602
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:18,538
another top dressing another 30 days do

603
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:20,279
another top dressing repeat that and

604
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:23,160
that's basically it just kind of water

605
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,899
in but with watering I do treat it

606
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,380
differently than when synthetics I don't

607
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,840
let it dry out between waterings I keep

608
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:33,419
it moist throughout the grow so most of

609
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:35,699
the time I will do the five percent rule

610
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:37,919
which is you take the size of the

611
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,779
container unless we use a seven gallon

612
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,940
Grill pot I'm going to be transitioning

613
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:44,819
up to a 10 gallon Grill pot for organic

614
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:48,058
but seven gallons so five percent of

615
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:49,798
that and then I would water that in

616
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,940
every two three days it depends on the

617
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:53,158
size of the plant there's so many

618
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:55,200
factors right sizes of plants size of

619
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:56,640
the container so on and so forth but my

620
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,440
goal with Organic is to keep keep the

621
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,538
medium moist at all times that way the

622
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,700
microbes are continuing to be active if

623
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:04,558
the soil dries out microbes go dormant

624
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,600
you don't get that breakdown of those

625
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,058
amendments turning them into usable

626
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:11,099
nutrients for the plants so making sure

627
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:13,558
that the medium is moist is is one of my

628
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:15,538
main goals with Organic

629
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:16,918
well said that's definitely for for

630
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:18,720
those of us listening right now that's

631
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,919
definitely uh worthy of note taking

632
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,839
right there and especially for some of

633
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,640
us getting into our first few grows that

634
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:25,500
note alone is something for me that took

635
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,799
a little bit to understand the benefits

636
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:31,319
and the the disadvantages to to not

637
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:33,839
keeping it moist so yeah well said on

638
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:35,939
that one Chris so talking about the

639
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,678
environments what kind of conditions are

640
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,019
you aiming for in your environment when

641
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,538
it comes to the humidity heat and all

642
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:44,700
that well first off when I first started

643
00:22:42,538 --> 00:22:46,740
growing indoors I didn't realize how

644
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,080
much of a pain it was going to be to

645
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,659
balance the environment oh my God what a

646
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:53,158
nightmare easier said than done for sure

647
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:54,539
but yeah I'll break it down one by one

648
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,860
so temperature we'll start with that

649
00:22:54,538 --> 00:23:01,500
typically what I aim for is 82 degrees

650
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:04,500
Fahrenheit at the highest I've grown you

651
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,900
know years in the past 85 87 as high as

652
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,058
87 degrees Fahrenheit in the past some

653
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,700
cultivars can take it no problem others

654
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:14,460
clearly struggle off of that I found 82

655
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,980
degrees Fahrenheit to be I'd deal for

656
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,960
most cultivars so I've been sticking

657
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,900
with that and then towards the end of

658
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,900
flowering particularly weeks you know

659
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,640
six seven and Beyond depending on how

660
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,080
many weeks that cultivar is I'll lower

661
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,120
the temps in order to try to conserve

662
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:32,579
the the terpenes have less terpenes

663
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:34,319
volatizing off the plant trick that I

664
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:36,000
got from Dr Bruce belgou talked about

665
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,319
him a little bit earlier he uh he

666
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,538
mentioned that one that's something I

667
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:40,980
take away from him but yeah lowering

668
00:23:39,538 --> 00:23:42,658
that temp down to about 70 degrees

669
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,179
Fahrenheit and the final weeks of

670
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:47,940
flowering is what I do there

671
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:50,340
um I try not for it to be more than a 15

672
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,860
degree swing you know sometimes it will

673
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:55,079
be in the low 60s Fahrenheit when the

674
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:57,178
lights are off for example towards the

675
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:00,480
end of flowering I'm okay with that but

676
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:02,759
if we're in veg or the beginning of

677
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,279
middle flowering I'll try to keep that

678
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:06,960
those temps up around 70 degrees the

679
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,658
lights off temp around 70 degrees

680
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,960
Fahrenheit moving on to humidity so I do

681
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:15,659
go after VPD so uh you know according to

682
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,640
the pulse VPD charts there's so many

683
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:20,220
freaking VPD charts on the internet man

684
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,659
it makes things so confusing people like

685
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,279
oh I'm going off the VPD chart well

686
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:25,620
which VPD chart because there's so many

687
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,899
that are different than other ones I've

688
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:29,158
been going off the pulse monitor VPD

689
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,580
charts that they have on their website

690
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:35,039
and so for example if I'm at 82 degrees

691
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:37,619
Fahrenheit which is what I run I aim for

692
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:41,038
about 60 to 70 percent that's in the the

693
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:42,779
green to dark green range on their chart

694
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:45,119
and then a flowering at 82 degrees

695
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:47,460
Fahrenheit it's between 52 and 62

696
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,918
percent that's again in the the dark

697
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,600
green to the the light green range I

698
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,340
don't get too nitpicky I know a lot of

699
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,259
people are like oh it needs to be in the

700
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:57,178
dark green range which is the most ideal

701
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:58,679
range if it goes into the light green

702
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:00,538
range on the chart I'm okay with that

703
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,000
it's it's perfectly fine in my opinion

704
00:25:00,538 --> 00:25:06,240
and most of the time you know I do have

705
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,700
to add in a humidifier for example right

706
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,038
now it's 30 humidity just in this room

707
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,720
right here that's that's average for

708
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:14,158
where I live and actually in the winter

709
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,980
time it gets lower it gets into the

710
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,559
teens

711
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:22,380
humidity yeah yeah chapped lips just dry

712
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:24,058
everything yeah yeah so you got

713
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:26,340
humidifiers going non-stop then inside

714
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:29,399
the tents or do you have them outside I

715
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:31,740
have one on each side I have a two by

716
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,360
four tent and a four by four tent I have

717
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,579
one in each of those and I have one just

718
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,379
in my lung room as well and that that

719
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:41,519
helps right to make sure that the the

720
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:44,220
air coming into the grow tent is of the

721
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,900
proper RH so that's been helpful for me

722
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,720
and then as far as CO2 I don't want to

723
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:51,480
skip over that I've tried so much in the

724
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,298
past for CO2 particularly the canisters

725
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,240
tnb natural canisters I've tried the

726
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:59,819
mushroom bags in the past both of those

727
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,380
did pretty good jobs at raising the CO2

728
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:03,119
I have a CO2 monitor so I'm actually

729
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:06,120
able to see whether or not it's working

730
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:09,058
and it's so up and down you know it's

731
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:12,359
it's never a consistent but it does

732
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:15,960
raise it you know whether it be 600 700

733
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:18,240
800 I've been up to 1200 PPM of CO2

734
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,659
using those methods but even not using

735
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,579
those methods just me exhaling the air I

736
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:25,860
I grow in the same house that I live in

737
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:28,558
I live here my girlfriend lives here I

738
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:31,019
have three cats live here we exhale CO2

739
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:33,538
and the air coming into my grow space is

740
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:37,200
coming from my house and looking at my

741
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:39,000
CO2 Monitor and seeing it at 800 PPM not

742
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,740
doing any supplementation I'm okay with

743
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,259
that and I'm a small home grower I'm

744
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,298
just growing for myself I'm not trying

745
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:47,460
to maximize yield at all I'm just I just

746
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:49,259
want to get a harvest just want to get a

747
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,179
sufficient Harvest off of each plant so

748
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:53,879
that's been okay for me so I no longer

749
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:57,179
do the supplementation CO2 but I've done

750
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,520
a lot in the past so it's been fun

751
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:00,778
and then uh air circulation I guess that

752
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,359
that's a part of the environment too

753
00:27:00,778 --> 00:27:05,339
right I have uh you know the oscillating

754
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:07,798
fans have a couple of those on you know

755
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:10,019
24 7 and I have them you typically

756
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:11,879
they're positioned above the canopy and

757
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:13,319
below the canopy or through the canopy

758
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,620
make sure that air is getting through

759
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:17,939
the canopy sufficiently and uh yeah I

760
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:19,859
haven't had any issues with powdery

761
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,860
mildew on that so do you have a certain

762
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:24,538
brand of of uh clip fans or fans like

763
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:26,519
you use big fans inside the tents or

764
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:27,839
using small clip fans or like what's

765
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,099
your your recommendation there because

766
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:30,778
that's a whole other thing me as a

767
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:33,298
grower as well that

768
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:34,798
I mean dude I almost started a fire like

769
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:36,538
a month and a half ago I'm not gonna lie

770
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,639
and this was like some Chinese fan that

771
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:41,220
I had running 24 7 just sitting in the

772
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,840
corner so from me to you like asking is

773
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,159
there any preferences or for Growers

774
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:45,778
that you would recommend for us to be

775
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,120
using as far as like a circulation

776
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:50,159
inside the room I've really been liking

777
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:51,538
those AC Infinity oscillating fans on

778
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,720
that clip on the side of the grow tent

779
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:56,339
I've really gone 100 to that in the past

780
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,798
though I mean they can be pretty pricey

781
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:00,538
in the past they've used a small um I

782
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,519
believe the brand is homes

783
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:04,679
tickets to nine inch oscillating fan

784
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:06,418
I've used a bunch of those in the grow

785
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:09,778
tents in the past in my grow room I've

786
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:11,460
used a 12 inch fan why am I not

787
00:28:09,778 --> 00:28:13,259
remembering the name of this brand it's

788
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,419
like one of the most popular brands of

789
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:17,278
oscillating fans anyways it was a 12

790
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:18,900
inch one I would use in my grow room

791
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,480
back when I was just an open grow room

792
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:23,640
and then I had it in a 4x4 for a little

793
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,038
for a few grows that was kind of an

794
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,840
Overkill to have that big of it but yeah

795
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:30,240
these days I highly recommend those AC

796
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,678
Infinity I think they're nine inch I

797
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,538
believe nine inch oscillating fans that

798
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,038
clip onto the side of the grow tent and

799
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:36,240
it wasn't until I seen the the fire that

800
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:37,500
almost started that I hopped on and

801
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,640
started looking at the solutions and

802
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,440
I've seen they were one of the only ones

803
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,480
that aren't using like little computer

804
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,100
fans like the little desk fans and then

805
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,980
just remodeling them to grow fans but

806
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:48,480
they actually designed something for it

807
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,159
um but yeah for me especially here is

808
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,200
it's a big topic is getting that

809
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,640
circulation right in the amount of it

810
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,840
and so that other company that you're

811
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,259
mentioning that wasn't a grow company

812
00:28:54,839 --> 00:29:00,298
right homes now homes is uh okay they

813
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:02,480
make all sorts of things I think they

814
00:29:00,298 --> 00:29:05,158
also make like uh air purification

815
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,319
systems and stuff like that it's another

816
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:09,120
good solution to check out for for those

817
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:11,399
of us looking for good circulation on

818
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,439
the inside so what about training the

819
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,700
plants bro again you've spoken to so

820
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,919
many people with different techniques

821
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,019
what do you do when it comes to training

822
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,120
your plants that's another thing man

823
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:22,798
where I've done so much over the years

824
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,599
it's fun it's fun to be able to

825
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,278
manipulate these plants and and see how

826
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:27,839
they grow differently um you know

827
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:29,640
they'll start with topping topping the

828
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:33,178
plant is something I do almost every

829
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,340
single grow is I'll top the plant and

830
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:37,320
you know I used to do I used to let the

831
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:39,418
plant grow up to the fifth node top down

832
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:41,700
of the third node then keep those lower

833
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:43,919
branches to to grow up and widen out

834
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,778
I've topped to the fourth node and kept

835
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,520
the lower branches to grow up top to the

836
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:49,919
fifth node kept the lower branches to

837
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:53,579
grow up these days it really depends on

838
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:56,340
growth I'll have some squattier plants

839
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:58,918
well I'll just maybe do one top on other

840
00:29:56,339 --> 00:30:01,019
plants that have longer internodes and

841
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,538
grow more stretchier maybe I'll talk

842
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:05,278
multiple times so it really all depends

843
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:06,960
on growth but most of the time I'm

844
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:09,240
topping at the fourth or fifth node

845
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,519
letting those side branches grow out

846
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,679
adding in some low stress training doing

847
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,679
that on top of it and then sometimes

848
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:19,980
I'll do additional Tops on those

849
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:21,840
branches that came out and you know I've

850
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,038
topped again and topped again and so on

851
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:24,959
and so forth I have a whole bunch of

852
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:28,200
branches but I typically like to have

853
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,179
about eight sometimes 16 main branches

854
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,519
coming up is typically what I aim for

855
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:33,899
and then doing those restraining on top

856
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:35,940
of it let's start saying with every

857
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:37,379
single plant and I just kind of keep it

858
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:40,080
somewhat simple I have those garden

859
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,640
clips those green garden clips clip onto

860
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:44,519
the side of the grill pot use regular

861
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:47,580
the garden ties kind of look like the

862
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:51,119
bread ties and as a

863
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:52,859
uh yep those ones right there yeah snap

864
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:54,538
it off however long you want it you just

865
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:56,579
like a little wire boom bread ties

866
00:30:54,538 --> 00:30:58,558
totally yeah he nailed it on that so

867
00:30:56,579 --> 00:31:01,079
yeah exactly as well for training down

868
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:02,940
yep so pulling the branches down using

869
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:04,678
that to secure them down to the side of

870
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,360
the grill pod if I'm at a fabric pot I

871
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:09,000
use a safety pin to pierce the side of

872
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:11,038
the grow pot but still using that uh

873
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,200
that those Garden ties in order to pull

874
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,599
the branches down so just basic low

875
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,860
stress training techniques there and

876
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:18,719
then super cropping is the other

877
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:22,199
training thing that I do once in a while

878
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:25,019
I'll mostly do super cropping when the

879
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,480
branches more in the center of the plant

880
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:29,819
and I can't really bend it down with low

881
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,380
stress training so I'll just super crop

882
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:32,939
those ones sometimes like when I'm gonna

883
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,740
scrog that for example and I have some

884
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,840
branches growing up taller than others

885
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,278
I'll super crop then as well

886
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:40,500
um those are really only the two times

887
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:43,919
that I actually utilize super cropping

888
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,898
got you and um as far as like when it

889
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,419
comes to lollipopping and defoliation

890
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:50,579
like what's your your process or your

891
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:53,399
strategy there so for lollipopping I'll

892
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:55,019
typically try to do it typically push it

893
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:57,538
off until like the first few weeks and

894
00:31:55,019 --> 00:32:00,179
flowering sometimes if there's a lack of

895
00:31:57,538 --> 00:32:01,500
airflow do it in veg but it's usually

896
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:03,419
either week one or week two and

897
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,659
flowering mostly sometimes week three of

898
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:09,480
flowering I will remove the lower third

899
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:11,760
sometimes the lower fourth of the plant

900
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,140
and completely strip everything off and

901
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,919
it kind of talked about this a little

902
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:18,899
bit earlier but I take the stuff that

903
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:20,278
I've trimmed off whether it be small

904
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:23,398
branches that aren't going to reach the

905
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:24,898
top or leaves and I'll cut them up or

906
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:27,000
I'll just uh you know leaves I'll just

907
00:32:24,898 --> 00:32:29,519
let them lay flat down onto the medium

908
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,440
now you know chop and drop style and

909
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,940
that turns into a mulch layer which

910
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,259
helps with the moisture retention so

911
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,620
that's what I've been doing recently for

912
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:39,658
lollipopping and then defoliating I

913
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:41,099
typically will do that as well I'll try

914
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:43,020
to push it off the first three weeks of

915
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:44,459
flowering sometimes I'll do it towards

916
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:46,798
the end of edge you know especially with

917
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,778
the lack of airflow in the center of the

918
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:51,658
canopy there well you know I'll do it on

919
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:53,640
either day one or day seven or the as

920
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:56,039
late as day 21.

921
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,740
and the way I typically like to do it is

922
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:00,480
I will remove the leaves more towards

923
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,640
the middle of the plant so if you're

924
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,319
looking kind of top down the middle of

925
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,299
the plant and we're moving leaves kind

926
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:08,700
of almost down towards the entire bottom

927
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:10,859
and I do like to leave a lot of the

928
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,960
outer leaves on the plant so like the

929
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:15,240
outside edge of the plants particularly

930
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,600
on the bottom of the plant I call it the

931
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:21,000
skirt technique is uh something that you

932
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:22,678
know keeping those larger fan leaves on

933
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,179
the bottom of the plant around the

934
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:27,120
bottom so it kind of looks like a skirt

935
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:28,740
particularly because I feel like you

936
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:30,178
know in the past when I was coming

937
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,679
across deficiency it's quite a bit

938
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:33,419
particularly when using synthetic bottle

939
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,700
nutrients that get that nitrogen

940
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:37,320
deficiency where people know that uh you

941
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,819
know textbook style you see it at the

942
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:40,379
start at the bottom of the plant and

943
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:42,839
start at the tip of the leaves and work

944
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:45,659
its way up towards the petiole if I keep

945
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:47,939
those bottom leaves on the plant I'm

946
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:49,260
able to identify that deficiency then

947
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,179
I'm able to make adjustments you know

948
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:52,500
add in feeding so that is still

949
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:54,899
something I do today I've been doing

950
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,940
that for many many years so yeah that's

951
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:59,278
that's defoliation and sometimes I will

952
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,860
look towards the end of flowering you

953
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,720
know day 45 if it's like an eight weeker

954
00:34:01,859 --> 00:34:06,599
or sometimes a little bit later than

955
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,820
that if there is some leaves covering

956
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:11,098
the butt sites I'll look to try to tuck

957
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:14,639
those leaves first but if I can't then

958
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:15,659
I'll do the removal gotcha so like and

959
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,740
and for those like who might be

960
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:18,539
listening it might be the first time

961
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:20,459
growing or just getting into it how

962
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:21,539
important is lollipopping defoliation or

963
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,220
training your plants is this something

964
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:24,960
that you personally do every single time

965
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:26,759
with every plant or are you just kind of

966
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,398
doing it when you have time for the

967
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,280
lollipopping I do it for every plant in

968
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:34,259
order to try to remove that larf that

969
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,179
comes on the bottom buds that are there

970
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,440
now there are some cultivars that are

971
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:39,358
going to dense up all the way down to

972
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,740
the bottom I consider that like you know

973
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:42,119
being lucky a little bit to have a

974
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:43,378
cultivar that's like that to where those

975
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:47,099
bottom buds aren't larf at all they're

976
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:49,440
actually hard buds that are usable but

977
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:52,679
for a lot of cultivars it ends up being

978
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,300
larf and nobody likes trimming larf you

979
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,858
know it ends up in my trim pile and I

980
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,500
use it for oil and butter and all that

981
00:34:55,858 --> 00:35:00,838
stuff but I want to get rid of it so

982
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,519
every single grow I do lollipopping and

983
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:04,799
then for defoliation

984
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:06,659
there are Grows Where just just some

985
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,180
cultivars you don't need to like I don't

986
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:11,879
need to because they're more like longer

987
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:13,799
internodes airflow isn't impacted

988
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,220
throughout the canopy so I find myself

989
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,720
doing very little defoliation if at all

990
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:20,819
so yeah it really depends on growth

991
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,379
depends on the cultivar in my opinion

992
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,180
well said

993
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,460
I feel like you ran the ocean fruit

994
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:29,098
before right the ocean fruit from uh

995
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:31,139
square one no no okay I'm around that

996
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:32,760
okay I feel like I have one that is like

997
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:34,139
finally one that isn't like larfy buds

998
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,760
on the bottom stuff that I should have

999
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:38,219
chopped off is like looking decent but

1000
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,839
uh a square one genetics yeah they they

1001
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:42,480
dense up all the way down like I had

1002
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,578
their frozen fuel and also their Bristol

1003
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,400
G dents is up all the way down the

1004
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:48,839
bottom yeah there's just some cultivars

1005
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,820
and I think this ocean fruit has Brisco

1006
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:51,960
g in it so that might be what I'm seeing

1007
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,640
but like towards the bottom of the

1008
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,199
plants and I did a lollipop but it was

1009
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:57,539
like the bottom quarter instead of like

1010
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,919
a whole third like you said and uh yeah

1011
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:00,300
I'm glad I kept some of those man like

1012
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,500
they're even photo worthy some of these

1013
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,359
which I got the photo shoot in the next

1014
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,099
few days on that one incredible yeah

1015
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:08,039
totally

1016
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:10,019
so what do you do for pest prevention

1017
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:11,519
living where you live the experience

1018
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:12,420
that you have what kind of pests you

1019
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,000
have to deal with and what have you

1020
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,639
learned as far as pest prevention

1021
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,460
well since I mostly grow indoors I've

1022
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:22,078
done a couple outdoor grows I actually

1023
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,820
have vegetables Outdoors but but

1024
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,440
particularly talking indoors I've been

1025
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,838
fortunate enough to not come across many

1026
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,420
pests the main pests that I've come

1027
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:32,159
across is fungus gnats really I've come

1028
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,440
across white flies before it was pretty

1029
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:36,118
minor I haven't come across spider mites

1030
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,720
or thrips or Russ's mites anything major

1031
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:42,240
like that aphids I've had outside but as

1032
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:44,279
far as indoors fungus gnats is used as

1033
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:45,919
the number one thing I'm battling so a

1034
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,000
couple things I do to prevent pests

1035
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,639
diatomaceous earth I've been using that

1036
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,400
past couple years actually last year two

1037
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:55,199
years and the way I use it is similar to

1038
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,900
a way a lot of people use it is they'll

1039
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:59,759
mix it up within the top inch or so of

1040
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,160
the soil because it said that

1041
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,720
diatomaceous earth it's it's pretty much

1042
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:08,159
like glass shards to these pests and uh

1043
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:09,659
particularly when when the larva is

1044
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,358
hatching and they're trying to get up

1045
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:13,500
above the soil it's they're getting hurt

1046
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:16,858
you know off it and they're they're

1047
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:19,858
dying off so I use yellow stickies so

1048
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:23,578
I'm not really a pest preventative

1049
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:25,619
but more to identify the pests there so

1050
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:27,839
I have a yellow sticky at every single

1051
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:29,820
you know every in every Grill pot so I

1052
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:31,679
can identify if there are any gnats

1053
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,240
flying around and then I can make

1054
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:35,940
adjustments from there if I need to

1055
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:37,979
spray the plant for example so I I've

1056
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,619
done I used to spray every single week I

1057
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:42,300
used to spray peppermint then the next

1058
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:44,700
week it would be Rosemary then the next

1059
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:47,339
week could be neem oil and I would do

1060
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:48,779
that as IPM as a preventative you were

1061
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:50,699
cycling with three different three

1062
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,960
different uh types of a preventative and

1063
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:53,939
why were you cycling with three

1064
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,380
different ones well it said that the

1065
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,838
pest gets used to it so if you're just

1066
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,880
doing peppermint every single week then

1067
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:03,420
the pests will get used to it then they

1068
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,640
won't actually deter the pests as well

1069
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,800
um so rotating it you know is said to be

1070
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:11,940
beneficial there but yeah I'd basically

1071
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:15,180
just mix it up water into a sprayer and

1072
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:17,880
then add in a teaspoon of Dr Bronner

1073
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:20,279
soap as a surfactant and then a bunch of

1074
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,720
drops of peppermint or Rosemary I know

1075
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,019
some people do five drops and people do

1076
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:26,519
20 drops of each of those neem oil you

1077
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:27,780
can just follow the instructions on the

1078
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:29,699
bottle type stuff that's what I

1079
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,500
typically do and then spraying the

1080
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:33,419
plants and typically uh I used to spray

1081
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,940
every week but I avoid that now now I'm

1082
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:38,400
only doing it as needed and typically

1083
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:40,858
I'll do it once before flipping the

1084
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,500
flower I like to do a nice spray of the

1085
00:38:40,858 --> 00:38:45,659
plant then flip over and I don't really

1086
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:49,559
use the peppermint Rosemary neem as much

1087
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:50,699
as I do now Mammoth can control so I'm

1088
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:53,219
not sure if you've heard of that product

1089
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:55,139
but that dough also has oils in it it's

1090
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:56,219
a thyme oil and corn oil mostly and

1091
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:58,139
there's some other ingredients in there

1092
00:38:56,219 --> 00:39:00,779
as well but I found that very effective

1093
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:02,759
not only to battle the fungus gnats but

1094
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,200
also as a preventative so spraying that

1095
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,720
before flipping the flour has been a

1096
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:09,419
beneficial to me or using uh the amazing

1097
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:12,358
Dr zymes Eliminator again that's another

1098
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:14,579
thing that can battle pests if you have

1099
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:16,199
an infestation helps with that but some

1100
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:18,660
people use it as a preventative as well

1101
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:21,239
so doing a spray in veg before cooking

1102
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:23,759
the flour is typically what I'll do it's

1103
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:25,559
it's as a preventative and then last

1104
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,839
thing I want to mention is that uh

1105
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:30,779
textbook thing is not to walk directly

1106
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:32,460
Outdoors indoors into your indoor garden

1107
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,680
so I'll typically you know if I'm coming

1108
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:37,260
from Outdoors I'll change the clothes

1109
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:40,259
for example and then go into my indoor

1110
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:41,700
garden so nice you know what we need to

1111
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,640
do Chris at some point we got to get

1112
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:46,078
Adidas tracksuits designed out and that

1113
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:47,819
should be like you know we come in from

1114
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,000
outside we put our Adidas tracksuit on

1115
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:51,960
and we go see the ladies you know

1116
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,059
long time when I'm thinking for a good

1117
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,500
IPM but no great points on that every

1118
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:57,539
every single thing through uh

1119
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,900
preventative all the way through to uh

1120
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:03,420
to the end okay so how do you go about

1121
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:04,740
harvesting drying and curing well look

1122
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:07,139
at the trichomes when it comes to

1123
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:08,819
harvesting I usually aim for mostly

1124
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:11,039
cloudy I don't really pay too much

1125
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,359
attention to how much Amber there is I

1126
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,719
know a lot of people will aim for you

1127
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:17,159
know 10 Amber 20 and 30 Amber they make

1128
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:19,679
their decision off of that I'm mostly

1129
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:23,098
I'm looking at mostly cloudy trying to

1130
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:24,719
see minimal clear trichomes at that

1131
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:26,220
point I'll Harvest I'll cut the plant at

1132
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:28,919
the base of the stock and hang the

1133
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:31,319
entire plant I typically dry in a grow

1134
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,599
tent that's been kind of my go-to is

1135
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:36,780
dragging a grow tent I'll uh whether it

1136
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,820
be a 4x4 or a 2x4 depending on the

1137
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:41,700
number of plants that I have

1138
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:43,500
I will have an oscillating fan at the

1139
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:44,578
bottom of the tent circulating air

1140
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,559
around I'll make sure that that

1141
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:48,780
oscillating fan doesn't isn't pointed up

1142
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:50,639
towards the the buds because that dries

1143
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,339
out the buds a little bit quicker than

1144
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:55,559
desired in my opinion live in a very dry

1145
00:40:53,338 --> 00:41:00,838
climate so I always have a humidifier to

1146
00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:03,299
add in humidity I aim for 60 RH at a 60

1147
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:05,578
degree Fahrenheit temperature now

1148
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,619
unfortunately I can't usually can't get

1149
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:11,339
as low as 60 degree Fahrenheit

1150
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:15,000
temperature it's usually about 65 65 to

1151
00:41:11,338 --> 00:41:18,480
68 is what I can usually get it down to

1152
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,639
so yeah ideally it would be 60 60 but uh

1153
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,139
I can't get it to that every time

1154
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:24,900
you know it usually drives for about

1155
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:28,139
seven to ten days roughly for me

1156
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:29,940
and then for curing I have been caring

1157
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:33,598
for many many years in glass mason jars

1158
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:37,440
so you know typical one ounce of Bud in

1159
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,180
a 32 ounce jar wide malt mason jar have

1160
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,900
a little hygrometer in there so I can

1161
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:46,919
see what the temperature NRH is you know

1162
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:49,200
I aim for around 62 in the jar if it's

1163
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,059
like 64 or above I'm taking the buds out

1164
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:52,439
of the jar and kind of letting them

1165
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:54,179
drive a little bit more before putting

1166
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,039
it back in there doing the typical

1167
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:57,598
burping I mean I feel like I've talked

1168
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:59,099
about this on my channel so much that I

1169
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,079
don't know how in detailed I want to get

1170
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:02,820
here on this podcast episode but at

1171
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:05,579
least daily burping right for at least

1172
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,200
the first few weeks is what I aim for I

1173
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:09,240
recently picked up those Grove bags

1174
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:10,919
which are really a hot product these

1175
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:12,118
days yeah a lot of people are ditching

1176
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,220
the mason jars and they're going after

1177
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:16,800
the Grove bags so yep I picked up some

1178
00:42:14,219 --> 00:42:21,059
of those haven't used them that much for

1179
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:23,400
for curing and I'm super excited now is

1180
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:24,838
I actually picked up one of those cannot

1181
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,380
rolls so I don't know if you heard about

1182
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:30,539
those ones are no no what's that oh man

1183
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:33,119
dude it's like I'm so excited about this

1184
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:35,338
I saw them at MJ bizcom yep and

1185
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,260
basically what it is is it's about the

1186
00:42:35,338 --> 00:42:39,119
size of a mini fridge okay but it

1187
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:42,660
controls both temperature and humidity

1188
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,820
what and it's for drying curing and

1189
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:47,098
storage and you can adjust the settings

1190
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:49,019
on a freaking Game Changer oh my God so

1191
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:51,119
literally I'm so excited to harvest next

1192
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:53,940
because I'm not gonna have to Heart uh

1193
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,099
dry in a grow tent anymore I'm gonna put

1194
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:58,740
in my cannot roll which holds up to 2.2

1195
00:42:56,099 --> 00:43:03,180
pounds and which is more than enough for

1196
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:05,639
me and put it in there set it to what I

1197
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:07,500
want for a drying temperature and drying

1198
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:10,078
our age actually it goes by dew point

1199
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,639
that shows the the humidity there and

1200
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,560
then it'll dry for a certain period of

1201
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:16,440
time and then you switch it over to the

1202
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:18,838
uh curing settings or storage settings

1203
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,099
and then it's good to go so huge game

1204
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:22,078
changer I do have a bunch of stuff in

1205
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:24,720
there right now for storage and it's

1206
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,640
holding steady it has like a um a little

1207
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:28,858
sponge at the bottom and a little little

1208
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:30,480
container there so you basically wet the

1209
00:43:28,858 --> 00:43:32,818
sponge and then keep it on the bottom

1210
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,679
rack there and that helps hold the

1211
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:37,199
proper humidity in there

1212
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:39,179
dude it's nuts I'm so so pumped to have

1213
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:40,500
this so your next like in the future

1214
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:42,239
with your Harvest you're not going to be

1215
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,260
like hang drying full plants you're

1216
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:44,759
going to be cutting it up and then

1217
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:48,540
drying inside this little mini fridge

1218
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:50,160
style build exactly exactly and they

1219
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:51,300

just talking I was just talking to Mr

1231
00:44:11,338 --> 00:44:16,019
Grow it you know I heard the rumors that

1232
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:18,358
someone this is like the new solution I

1233
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:20,159
need a discount code and uh please tie

1234
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:21,598
to to Mr growing because you were the

1235
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,420
one that let me know about this amazing

1236
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,920
invention wow

1237
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,838
they're they're making sense I don't

1238
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,420
know I mean 1600 I think is the price

1239
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:31,440
tag on them right now plus shipping or

1240
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,300
maybe this free shipping I don't

1241
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,619
remember just saving one Harvest though

1242
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,539
I feel like you can make that money back

1243
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:38,280
you know I've lost Harvest to mold

1244
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:39,900
before you know we're hyphenated here so

1245
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,760
I've lost harvest in the past and I feel

1246
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,920
like saving one or two or hitting a

1247
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,560
perfect cure would pay itself off after

1248
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,880
like two or three harvests no but yeah I

1249
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:51,000
think it's worth the money so that's why

1250
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,160
I spent the money on it yeah it could

1251
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,539
call bro okay so before we move on I

1252
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:56,399
just had one quick question and we don't

1253
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:57,960
have to take too long in this what was

1254
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,400
it like remember the first harvest you

1255
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,900
explained to me about it the first time

1256
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,599
you were growing what was your Harvest

1257
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:06,180
process curing and drying process like

1258
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,859
back then compared to now

1259
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:08,879
like what was your first time like

1260
00:45:07,858 --> 00:45:10,679
drawing and harvesting what were you

1261
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,559
doing oh Ma'am I made my first

1262
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:15,719
successful grow I was just I just had it

1263
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:17,818
in a closet you know I was hang drying

1264
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:19,559
similar you know cutting it at the base

1265
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:21,779
of the plant and hanging the whole plant

1266
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:24,480
upside down with the clothes hanger for

1267
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:26,579
example and just leaving it in the

1268
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,740
closet and there was no I wasn't using a

1269
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:31,140
humidifier I was in temperature control

1270
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:32,818
you know I wasn't doing any of that and

1271
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:34,618
I was probably losing a ton of terpenes

1272
00:45:32,818 --> 00:45:36,358
you know but back then nobody really

1273
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:38,039
focused on that at least my group of

1274
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:40,078
friends didn't really focus on that we

1275
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:41,279
just let the plant dry to what it was

1276
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,519
going to dry we never didn't even have

1277
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,960
those hygrometers for the jars so we

1278
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:49,500
weren't controlling whether or not the

1279
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:53,480
the humidity was right probably had mold

1280
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:55,679
for all we know you know in there

1281
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,659
so much different now you know we're

1282
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:59,879
doing so much I'm doing so much more now

1283
00:45:57,659 --> 00:46:02,940
in order to make sure that I don't get

1284
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:05,760
mold during the drying process and

1285
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:08,338
curing process because it's it's so easy

1286
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,400
I've had it happen before it's just it's

1287
00:46:08,338 --> 00:46:13,799
so easy to get if your conditions aren't

1288
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,420
right totally and once you get it it's

1289
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,920
hard to go back meaning it's going to

1290
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,838
happen again and again on every Harvest

1291
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,159
so yeah you make sure you tackle those

1292
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:22,139
problems at the very beginning and

1293
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:23,639
really well said as far as those tips

1294
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:25,500
and tricks because is it fair to say

1295
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:27,960
that your your process what you're doing

1296
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,519
right now for curing harvesting and is

1297
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,559
is making the difference on the flavors

1298
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:33,539
compared to back in the day yeah I think

1299
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:35,578
there's been there's a huge change I

1300
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:37,079
mean especially with the conserving the

1301
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:38,760
terpenes I think a lot of people make

1302
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,700
this big and it took me many many years

1303
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:44,460
to really realize this is curing isn't

1304
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:46,858
the end the you know storage come comes

1305
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:49,440
after it all people say oh well you're

1306
00:46:46,858 --> 00:46:50,818
when you're storage you're still curing

1307
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,619
you're not gonna not gonna fight that

1308
00:46:50,818 --> 00:46:55,318
battle but um when you when you're

1309
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:57,720
curing and storing it a lot of people

1310
00:46:55,318 --> 00:47:01,079
ignore the temperature the storage

1311
00:46:57,719 --> 00:47:04,019
temperature so like I spent so long just

1312
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:07,019
having stuff out in the open it being 75

1313
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:08,699
80 degrees just in my room in the

1314
00:47:07,019 --> 00:47:11,818
storage area sure it would be in the

1315
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:15,480
dark but still like the the the the bud

1316
00:47:11,818 --> 00:47:17,940
Browns a lot quicker than the stuff in

1317
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,099
Proper Storage temperature so a lot of

1318
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:22,920
people will do 60 degrees Fahrenheit

1319
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:25,559
upwards of 68 degrees fahrenheit as

1320
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,980
their storage temperature and yeah doing

1321
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:31,380
that I actually have some bud here that

1322
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,639
uh you can clearly see the bud that was

1323
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,140
in a temperature controlled environment

1324
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:36,059
versus a non-temperature controlled

1325
00:47:34,139 --> 00:47:37,739
environment a higher temperature than

1326
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:39,838
the temperature control environment you

1327
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:41,399
can clearly see Browning the Browning of

1328
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:42,900
the bud happens within the first two

1329
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,519
three months you can see a clear

1330
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,740
difference I think a lot of people again

1331
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:49,559
ignore the fact of their storage

1332
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:52,618
temperature and their their bud is

1333
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:55,500
deteriorating a lot quicker and then as

1334
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:58,380
far as the RH or moisture your content

1335
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:00,659
now in my opinion the more drier it is

1336
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,338
the more harsher it is I had somebody

1337
00:48:00,659 --> 00:48:03,838
debate me on that one time so I'm not

1338
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:06,299
going to say I'm going to say that for

1339
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:08,279
everybody's opinion but uh I feel like

1340
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:10,680
it's the drier it is the more crumbly it

1341
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,780
gets it's look it's just harsh on my

1342
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:15,838
throat at least so yeah making sure that

1343
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:17,280
the RH is around that 62 percent has has

1344
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:18,179
been a game changer for me over the

1345
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,579
years

1346
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:22,858
good call good call and yeah definitely

1347
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:24,300
a very important piece to everything all

1348
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,500
the work that we've done as a grower to

1349
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,519
get to this part definitely it's

1350
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,380
something we should be paying attention

1351
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:30,119
to and focusing on and

1352
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,680
most certainly listening to Chris and

1353
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:32,760
what he's doing because you've proven

1354
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:35,338
the results and you've talked to a lot

1355
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,900
of experts on it so for those people

1356
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:38,400
listening to this podcast right now or

1357
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,440
maybe even tuned in watching the YouTube

1358
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,940
version of it and they're beginner

1359
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:45,179
Growers

1360
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:46,619
Mr Grow it Chris what is a message that

1361
00:48:45,179 --> 00:48:48,838
you would like to or some type of advice

1362
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:51,720
maybe that you like to give for beginner

1363
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:54,179
Growers yeah I know I have a large

1364
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:56,279
handful of beginner Growers that tune

1365
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:59,159
into my content it's got to be

1366
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:01,140
got to be well over 50 50 60 70 percent

1367
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:04,500
or you know within their first year or

1368
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:06,598
two you know so uh yeah advice I think

1369
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,159
uh you know I'll keep it pretty broad

1370
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:10,440
here is don't get caught up in the noise

1371
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:12,239
there are a million ways to go about

1372
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:15,358
growing these plants

1373
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:17,519
there are some content creators out

1374
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:19,440
there that say it's their way or the

1375
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:21,420
highway they have the best way to do it

1376
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,720
and everybody else is doing things wrong

1377
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:26,760
and that's just so far from the truth

1378
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:29,279
there are so many different ways to go

1379
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,380
this plant successfully try out

1380
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,420
different ways you know experiment have

1381
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:35,940
fun with it there isn't just one way to

1382
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:37,800
do it to go about it the other ways to

1383
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:39,300
go about it are just alternate ways to

1384
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,859
go about it again most of the time

1385
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:43,200
you're getting to the same ending there

1386
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:44,818
so don't get caught up in the noise and

1387
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:46,078
don't think that you know everything I

1388
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:47,219
mean there's there's are you at the

1389
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,539
comment you probably get the comments

1390
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:50,759
too in the comments section where it's

1391
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:53,159
like I've been going for 30 years I know

1392
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,359
everything you know it's like yeah no

1393
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:56,338
you don't but we don't know everything

1394
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:58,078
they're still scientists don't know

1395
00:49:56,338 --> 00:50:00,119
anything we're still identifying things

1396
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,300
about this plant it's a never-ending

1397
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:05,579
knowledge so that's one thing I love so

1398
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:07,318
much about gardening growing plants is

1399
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:09,720
that it's an endless amount of things

1400
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:12,659
that you can learn and then yeah I just

1401
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:15,179
for me I just push myself to continue to

1402
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:17,039
learn and continue to try things out and

1403
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:19,440
that makes things a lot fun for me so

1404
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:20,880
yeah that's the advice I have for for

1405
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,440
beginners out there

1406
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,940
probably the best because then after

1407
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,318
that you take that seriously then the

1408
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,358
rest kind of just starts to make sense

1409
00:50:25,318 --> 00:50:28,858
you know after like stopping like

1410
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:31,920
stopping complicating everything

1411
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:33,719
listening to this podcast number one is

1412
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,460
the most beneficial thing we could all

1413
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:37,500
be doing but uh yeah do not over

1414
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:39,179
complicate the things

1415
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,559
one big question this one's for me and a

1416
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:42,779
lot of people that have been tuning in

1417
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,400
to your show over you know how long has

1418
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:48,000
the show been going for now by the way

1419
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,920
the podcast two years just just passing

1420
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,619
the two-year Mark here it's crazy dude

1421
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,180
so two years two years since this sucker

1422
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:55,920
started it feels like we've been hanging

1423
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:57,000
out for 10. I feel like we're best

1424
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,260
buddies the amount of times that I've

1425
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,239
listened to you on the podcast and all

1426
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:03,000
your guests but for all of us viewers

1427
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:05,818
listeners what does the future look like

1428
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,440
for this Garden Talk podcast well I'm

1429
00:51:05,818 --> 00:51:09,119
gonna make some changes you know I feel

1430
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,980
like doing the same thing over and over

1431
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,200
again I'm always looking to improve uh

1432
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:15,480
now with the 100th episode here I think

1433
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:17,699
it's about time to make some changes to

1434
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,260
try to make things better so starting in

1435
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:21,960
the next episode I'm not gonna spoil it

1436
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:25,020
all but there will be a new intro coming

1437
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:29,220
up in all future episodes I want to

1438
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:31,679
simplify things I spent so long

1439
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:33,959
getting caught up in the length of the

1440
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:36,539
episodes I was like oh it's got to be 45

1441
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:38,338
minutes to 60 minutes and sure there

1442
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:40,079
have been guests that have gone longer

1443
00:51:38,338 --> 00:51:42,358
with that and it's fine I get some good

1444
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,680
information about out of it yeah there

1445
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:45,960
have been some episodes that have been

1446
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:47,399
shorter than that 45 minutes but there

1447
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,179
have been some episodes where I kind of

1448
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,460
just

1449
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:51,779
I would say Force the conversation but

1450
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,579
like I could have ended the conversation

1451
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:55,500
sooner but just try to get more out of

1452
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:57,599
it and you know expanding more on a

1453
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:59,099
topic than needed right so like I'm not

1454
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,140
going to shy away from shorter episodes

1455
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:03,059
moving forward you know if it's cool if

1456
00:52:01,139 --> 00:52:05,338
there's a 20 minute episode on the topic

1457
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:06,839
I'm going to be okay with that nice you

1458
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:09,000
know I actually got that advice got to

1459
00:52:06,838 --> 00:52:10,318
give a shout out to my girlfriend who

1460
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,880
that's all she does is listen to

1461
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:14,159
podcasts all day long while she's

1462
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,599
working I don't know how she does it I

1463
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:17,159
can't do that I can't listen to

1464
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,480
something else I have something else in

1465
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:21,000
my ears while I'm trying to do something

1466
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,260
but she can right right and you know I

1467
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,780
got this advice from her where she's

1468
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:26,640
like look at this on this podcast is an

1469
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:28,319
hour and a half long episode but this

1470
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:29,639
next one's only 20 minutes that's all

1471
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:32,099
they needed to cover is 20 minutes and

1472
00:52:29,639 --> 00:52:34,679
I'm like you know what yeah okay so I'm

1473
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:36,539
gonna be more open to not really caring

1474
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:38,818
much about the actual length of the

1475
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:40,619
episodes awesome I have a long list of

1476
00:52:38,818 --> 00:52:44,400
guests lined up for the future that I'm

1477
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:46,380
super super excited about and uh you

1478
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,200
know one last thing is I want to ensure

1479
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:50,940
that the guest is bringing valuable

1480
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:53,039
valuable information to the table so

1481
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:56,039
doing a better vetting process there

1482
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:58,380
have been a couple guests where I wish

1483
00:52:56,039 --> 00:53:00,480
they had more to bring to the table yeah

1484
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:02,579
which is fine you know the the past is

1485
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,440
the past you know you don't really know

1486
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:06,318
somebody until you start talking to them

1487
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,460
so just doing my due diligence

1488
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:10,739
researching somebody maybe having a

1489
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:12,480
conversation with them before I agree to

1490
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:14,639
have them on the podcast to make sure

1491
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,679
that it's structured and the information

1492
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:18,058
being brought out is going to be

1493
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:19,558
valuable for my audience I don't want to

1494
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:21,300
waste my audience time you know what I

1495
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:23,940
mean this is everybody's time is

1496
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:25,260
valuable and uh it sucks when you're

1497
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:27,240
tuned into something you're like wait

1498
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:28,440
why am I watching this or why am I even

1499
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:30,179
listening I'm not really getting much

1500
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,159
out of this all right click out of it

1501
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:34,379
and move on to something else you know I

1502
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:35,879
don't want it to be like that so so yeah

1503
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,440
definitely have some changes coming up

1504
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,500
coming in the future on the the podcast

1505
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,780
here I'm excited about and uh you just

1506
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:44,639
have to stay tuned in and check it out

1507
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:46,140
and I most certainly will be and I hope

1508
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:48,299
everyone listening right now will be as

1509
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:50,159
well such amazing work done in the last

1510
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:52,380
two years you know and to hear what's

1511
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:53,818
coming in the future is exciting I love

1512
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,380
the changes I love where you're gonna go

1513
00:53:53,818 --> 00:53:56,699
is and if you don't want to share it

1514
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,039
totally fine but is there any way you

1515
00:53:56,699 --> 00:54:00,779
can give us maybe a few people coming

1516
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:02,099
out next year some interviews that we

1517
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,480
could get excited about or something

1518
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:06,838
throw some names out there if not

1519
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:09,059
totally fine but if so yeah uh well you

1520
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:11,338
know I I try to put you on the spot by

1521
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:14,760
the way no it's cool it's cool I I

1522
00:54:11,338 --> 00:54:16,558
typically don't like naming guests that

1523
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,660
I plan to have on in the future without

1524
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,819
already having it filmed gotcha because

1525
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:22,558
I've made the mistake in the past of

1526
00:54:20,818 --> 00:54:24,838
saying people's names like oh I'm gonna

1527
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,760
get this this person agreed to come on

1528
00:54:24,838 --> 00:54:29,519
the podcast and they actually never came

1529
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:32,099
on the podcast so I'm a little bummed

1530
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:34,139
out by that but for this purpose I will

1531
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:36,359
damn a couple people oh I'm pretty

1532
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:38,578
confident will come on here which is Dr

1533
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:41,159
MJ Coco big shout out to him I met him

1534
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:42,480
at MJ bizcon he's huge amount of

1535
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:44,818
knowledge he has with both growing and

1536
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,740
Coco so yeah an LED girls in particular

1537
00:54:44,818 --> 00:54:48,960
I really want to pick his brain on both

1538
00:54:46,739 --> 00:54:51,118
of those topics yeah so not filmed yet

1539
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,000
so hopefully we do film it and get that

1540
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:56,519
out yep Jordan River from the growcast

1541
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,338
podcast yeah he's been doing a lot of

1542
00:54:56,519 --> 00:55:00,480
soil courses with queen of the sun grown

1543
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:02,759
interesting he's been traveling around

1544
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,619
doing those actually and so I really

1545
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,780
want to pick his brain on pretty much

1546
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:09,660
like soil science buildings you know

1547
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:11,040
your native soil using that and uh so

1548
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:13,440
I'm excited for that those are a couple

1549
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:16,259
that I have off top my head I talked to

1550
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,240
Tad Hussey recently I haven't asked him

1551
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:20,520
to come on the podcast but I will be

1552
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:22,799
asking him hopefully he comes on maybe

1553
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:24,300
y'all can uh head on over to his like

1554
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,680
social media and be like hey you should

1555
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,420
go on the garden Talk podcast video

1556
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:31,318
that'll get him to come on potentially

1557
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:32,700
but yeah it takes a few of us to let him

1558
00:55:31,318 --> 00:55:35,219
know that we want to hear him on the

1559
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:37,019
podcast and uh we might get him on yeah

1560
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:38,699
and then repeat guests so I definitely

1561
00:55:37,019 --> 00:55:40,139
want to get some some folks back on the

1562
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:43,139
podcast maybe we can get you back on the

1563
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:44,879
podcast at some point to do some more to

1564
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:46,500
do another talk here but yeah I'm not

1565
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,358
going to shy away for repeat guests I

1566
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:50,280
started having some folks on for a

1567
00:55:48,358 --> 00:55:51,960
second time I'm not going to flood the

1568
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,579
Channel with repeat guests maybe one

1569
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,019
repeat guest a month or something like

1570
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:56,460
that good idea I'm still trying to

1571
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:58,440
figure that out go with the flow type

1572
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:59,880
stuff but uh yeah I definitely want to

1573
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,380
get some of these other people back if I

1574
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,480
get Dr Bruce bugby back on that'd be

1575
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:05,160
awesome if I get Jeremy Silva from build

1576
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,719
the soil on that'd be awesome you know

1577
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:08,279
there's there's some folks where really

1578
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:10,139
I want to do a part two we need to

1579
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,240
continue that conversation

1580
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:13,318
yeah exactly to me as a viewer as well I

1581
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:15,358
already know I have my list of part

1582
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:16,920
two's that I want to see and I have no

1583
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:17,940
doubt that that this year coming up and

gonna hit every single one of those and

1586
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,858

00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:13,019
impersonator accounts so be careful

1610
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:15,659
there I don't sell anything through

1611
00:57:13,019 --> 00:57:17,519
Instagram so keep that in mind if

1612
00:57:15,659 --> 00:57:19,139
somebody reaches out to you with an

1613
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:21,059
account that looks like mine and they're

1614
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:24,480
asking you to send them money don't do

1615
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:26,579
it at Mr groat on Twitter Mr good on

1616
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,159
Facebook mrgrow.com and from

1617
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:30,539
thestash.com that's where you can find

1618
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:32,818

1619
00:57:30,539 --> 00:57:35,099

1620
00:57:32,818 --> 00:57:37,858
have that out should be out this year at

1621
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:39,300
some point it was actually delayed for a

1622
00:57:37,858 --> 00:57:41,400
little bit I have some family health

1623
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,839
issues I had to travel back home and

1624
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,480
stuff like that my dad is battling

1625
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:47,279
cancer he had lung cancer he was

1626
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,019
diagnosed last year it spread to his

1627
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,660
other lung actually spread to his brain

1628
00:57:49,019 --> 00:57:54,000
and they gave him one month to live so

1629
00:57:51,659 --> 00:57:56,159
everything's on hold uh you know until

1630
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,780

1631
00:57:56,159 --> 00:57:58,739
final final days with them

00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:01,260

dude I'd love to see those shorts

1645
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:30,900
rolling out is that what we're thinking

1646
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,460
some of the interviews maybe in shorts

1647
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:35,400
maybe uh some of that cut up into

1648
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:37,079
smaller bite-sized content yeah shorts I

1649
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,818
mean I need to do that as well I was

1650
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:40,798
trying to get some of those on to all

1651
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:42,239
social media really not everybody likes

1652
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:43,679
to listen to full length podcast

1653
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:45,539
episodes and there's so much good

1654
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:47,338
information in these episodes so taking

1655
00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:49,019
that information cutting them out on a

1656
00:58:47,338 --> 00:58:50,818
smaller little bite-sized chunks and

1657
00:58:49,019 --> 00:58:53,460
then posting them on the channels yeah I

1658
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:55,079
think that'll be valuable beautiful dude

1659
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:57,960

1682
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:43,500
episodes you know it's uh it's been a

1683
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:45,539
journey and I I never thought that I

1684
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:47,219
would be a podcaster it just happened

1685
00:59:45,539 --> 00:59:49,619
you know I thought I thought I was going

1686
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:51,239
to do 101 discussion videos with Growers

1687
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:54,059
and it actually turned into a podcast

1688
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:55,199
and then I got approached by a couple

1689
00:59:54,059 --> 00:59:57,839
other guys to be on another podcast

1690
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:59,639
called from the stash so I never thought

1691
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:02,159
I'd be a podcaster but it's it's fun

1692
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:03,900

1703
