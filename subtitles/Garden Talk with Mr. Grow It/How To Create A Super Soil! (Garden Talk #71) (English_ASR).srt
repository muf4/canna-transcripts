1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,200
coming up on garden talk go ahead and

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:09,759
soak it in dechlorinated water that's

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,839
been ph at 5.5 to 5.7 i try to aim rate

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:14,080
at 5.7 that's kind of the sweet spot for

5
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:16,000
cocoa so if i'm in a seedling stage

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,039
looking for the 200 ppm i might make the

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,399
compost tea 300 ppm for indoor grows i

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,679
don't suggest anything bigger than a

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,679
seven gallon you're gonna get some

10
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,000
monstrous plants i generally try to tell

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,920
people one gallons three gallons and

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,198
five gallons are like really the best

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,560
size pots

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,920
you're going to get disheartened and

15
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,199
you're not going to want to grow and

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,239
you're not going to cultivate because

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,480
you're going to feel like you wasted a

18
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,839
whole bunch of money so less less less

19
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,238
less is more

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,079
let them brew let them really become

21
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,679
accessible i mean it's a night and day

22
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,119
difference when you feed compost teas

23
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,799
within two days your plants will look

24
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,320
completely different so that's my

25
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,320
favorite thing about organics

26
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,718

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,199
derek from homegrown world how you doing

86
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,959
today

87
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,919
good man thanks for having me how are

88
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,840
you doing

89
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,639
doing pretty good yeah thanks for coming

90
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,158
on i'm super excited about today's topic

91
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,359
we're going to talk all about super

92
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:21,199
soils and how to create them i think

93
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,200
a lot of people listening in on this a

94
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,199
lot of people garden in general wants to

95
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:28,000
make things more efficient wants to be

96
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,399
more hands-off the ability to mix up a

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,759
soil and then use that one batch

98
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,319
throughout the entire grow so you're

99
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,840
just basically watering in the entire

100
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,919
growth so i think that's a lot of

101
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,360
people's goals i think it's easier said

102
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,000
than done but today we're going to talk

103
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,920
all about that and how you do that and

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,439
so on and so forth but first can you

105
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,199
tell us a little bit about yourself and

106
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,359
how you got into gardening yeah

107
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,359
absolutely so i'm an educator for

108
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,560
medicinal plant medicine as well as

109
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,000
various

110
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,479
mycology

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,959
forums that i help write guides for and

112
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,280
just in general i educate for

113
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,959
various plant and cultivation purposes

114
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,039
for the last two years i've done it on

115
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,080
youtube instagram and

116
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,158
um as well as my own podcast and

117
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,640
it's been a wonderful experience i've

118
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:15,199
grown up growing my own plants uh from

119
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,680
lettuce tomatoes to medicinal

120
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,759
mushrooms like shiitake or culinary

121
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,600
mushrooms like pink oysters to just so

122
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,280
many more plants that i'm a huge animal

123
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,439
and herb lover so i definitely gotta get

124
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,119
my own you know mints and peppermints

125
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,478
out of my garden for use in in the

126
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,720
kitchen so it's definitely been a

127
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,800
passion of mine for many years sweet and

128
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,280
then what's your style of gardening are

129
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,800
you indoors outdoors what medium are you

130
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,198
in are you organic could you grow

131
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,600
synthetic inputs and so on so forth so

132
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,319
i've touched uh on a little bit of all

133
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,400
of those i mainly do organic cultivation

134
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,240
with soils now but i've done pretty much

135
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,359
every type of cultivation but i prefer

136
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,040
organic

137
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,439
okay cool

138
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,800
let's get into the first question here

139
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:01,199
which is what is a supersoil

140
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,439
so zebra soil is essentially well that

141
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,199
phrase was coined by actually for many

142
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,800
people who don't know there was a grower

143
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,360
named subcool

144
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,400
that crafted a very

145
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,000
legendary

146
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,599
it's called a legacy mix actually now

147
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,560
because it's created a legacy for

148
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,840
himself

149
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,079
he unfortunately has passed away but

150
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,319
since then the dank company has kept

151
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,959
this recipe which is basically a

152
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,599
specific blended soil that has the

153
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:28,159
proper aeration nutrient mixture

154
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,240
acidity level whatever you're seeking as

155
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,919
an individual cultivator to be able to

156
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,519
grow your plant from start to finish

157
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:34,959
whether it be tomato plants lettuce

158
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,959
anything like that

159
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,439
without having to add nutrients or if

160
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,758
you have to add anything bare minimum of

161
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,959
maybe a topping of earthworm castings so

162
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,680
it's meant to pretty much be completely

163
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,359
uh sufficient with microbiology you know

164
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,199
generally they include

165
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,479
microbial life whether it's you know

166
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,720
some some

167
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,159
different mycorrhizae bacterials and

168
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,520
things like that so

169
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,639
the good stuff that you want in your

170
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,560
garden but it's a mixture that's just a

171
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,400
just a good nutrient blend for your

172
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,319
plants start to finish

173
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,560
yeah i've heard about the sub cools

174
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,439
super soil mix and there's a few other

175
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,918
popular ones out there have you used any

176
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,038
of those mixes or do you have kind of

177
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,038
your own

178
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,519
so i actually do my own blend i've used

179
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:22,000
coots before once or twice

180
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,839
i think i've used it once back on a farm

181
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,680
years ago in florida i can't guarantee

182
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,758
that but i have used it since then i

183
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,840
like their blend quite a bit

184
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,199
build the soil

185
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,279
sub cools

186
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,038
soil recipes and a few others are ones

187
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,959
that i really want to try

188
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,399
generally i just build my own and

189
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,000
they're very simple it's just with what

190
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,399
i have at my local gardening centers

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,120
that just make it affordable so when you

192
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,799
make this super soil talking about

193
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,120
medicinal plants in general there's a

194
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,038
balance of nutrition that has to happen

195
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,959
right so generally speaking a lot of

196
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,519
people notice that in the vegetation

197
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:58,318
stage the plant typically uptakes more

198
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:00,240
nitrogen and the flowering stage you've

199
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,960
got there up taking more of the

200
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,280
phosphorus and potassium right so

201
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,198
when you're making this super soil is

202
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,038
there a specific balance that you're

203
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,560
trying to achieve that will last you

204
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,318
throughout your entire throughout the

205
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,319
entire grill or like how does that work

206
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,000
since the plant has different

207
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,759
nutritional needs throughout the

208
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,439
different stages of growth

209
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,038
that's a wonderful question and that's

210
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,879
something that like pretty much every

211
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,959
super soil creator really has to

212
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,159
struggle with um you know dialing in

213
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:30,239
their recipes i go for the 132 ratio

214
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,960
just right off the gate for npk which is

215
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,519
a you know one ratio of nitrogen to

216
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,519
three ratios of potassium and

217
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:41,120
two ratios of phosphorus or i think i

218
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:43,519
got that backwards sorry um but uh

219
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,519
i try to go for that mixture and i try

220
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,159
to keep it simple now if i'm going to

221
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,918
play around and do like maybe two four

222
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,120
eight okay well i'm going to test it i'm

223
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:52,959
going to see how that runs with the

224
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,439
tomato plant just like how i'm going to

225
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:56,638
see it it runs with a medicinal plant

226
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,399
and those are the types of things you

227
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,160
have to look for when i tell people

228
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,359
to make their own recipes at home when

229
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,160
i'm looking for my ratio just simple 132

230
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,720
is the

231
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,240
simplistic um

232
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,759
way to make sure that you're not going

233
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,560
to burn your plants and you're going to

234
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,800
have quality enough food now also what

235
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,280
comes into play is ec and ppm when

236
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,960
you're talking about that as well so um

237
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,038
there's a little more variables into it

238
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,878
but 132 is about the ratio that i like

239
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:23,918
to to keep within

240
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,000
okay

241
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,839
we'll get deeper into the fertilizer and

242
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,839
the amendments that you're using in a

243
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,240
little bit here i know there's a lot of

244
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,759
new folks that are just mixing up soil

245
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,599
for the first time and i think one of

246
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,158
the easier ways for the purposes of

247
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,240
podcast of organization and try to

248
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:43,599
simplify the information that you're

249
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,000
about to say is is breaking it down into

250
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,240
your base whether it be like a peat or a

251
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,879
cocoa or something else

252
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,399
aeration after that and then kind of

253
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,838
talking about like compost and worm

254
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,679
castings and then the additional

255
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,160
fertilizers and amendments that you put

256
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,799
into it that's kind of really makes up

257
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,519
an entire super soil so starting with

258
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,719
the peat and cocoa are using either one

259
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,039
of those or is it something else that

260
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,800
you're using as a base to begin

261
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:11,039
so that's actually cocoa is the big one

262
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,799
that i use i just get cocoa blocks i

263
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,559
like there's a few companies i get them

264
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,319
from sometimes i'll just actually snag

265
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,359
the cocoa that's made for reptiles

266
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,278
because it's a little more cleaner

267
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,480
sometimes so it's actually a little

268
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,000
cheaper too

269
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,200
but if they don't have that my reptile

270
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,720
store in the blocks because they're

271
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,200
they're out or something i'll go with

272
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:32,399
like a rio coco or a um a uh uh just a

273
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,320
your in general uh pro mix coco just go

274
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,080
ahead and break it down or whatever um

275
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,959
but just a coconut husk or coconut

276
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,440
fibers really does good aeration um i i

277
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,278
do prefer sometimes i do prefer peat

278
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,720
moss in my mixes depending on what i'm

279
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,240
going to go ahead and add to it so if

280
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,519
it's going to be a more earthworm heavy

281
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,600
mix i'm going to go ahead and add a

282
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,839
little more peat moss to my mix i find

283
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,080
that it it holds a little more moisture

284
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,360
for the long term versus cocoa cocoa can

285
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,600
really let it out

286
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,399
earthworm castings really like to not

287
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,920
dry out as far as microbial life you

288
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,000
know going after them and things it's a

289
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,759
little more better when it's humid and

290
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,759
things like that so promotes better

291
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,200
bacteria so that's kind of the bases i

292
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,519
like to stick to i don't really stray

293
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,278
away from too many of those i like to

294
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,278
stick to my cocoa

295
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:16,958
not unfortunately not all cocoa is

296
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:18,240
created equal

297
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,639
you can get them in

298
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,799
several different ways right the brick

299
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,399
for example is very common to where it's

300
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,039
dried up in a brick and you have to

301
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,120
actually hydrate it first there's uh you

302
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,599
know some people do the rinsing and

303
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,039
buffering or you can get the bag stuff

304
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,159
let's get deeper into coco what do you

305
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,519
do to like prepare the cocoa to begin

306
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,639
okay so that's a that's a wonderful

307
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,200
question because a lot of people skip

308
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,799
this process and even when they tell me

309
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,720
it's like pre-ready or you know it's

310
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,240
been phd or whatever i still do this i

311
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,200
do this with all my cocoa just to make

312
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,839
sure so

313
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,360
first thing is is i go ahead and soak it

314
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:57,680
in dechlorinated water that's been ph at

315
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,680
5.5 to pop 5.7 i try to aim rate at 5.7

316
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,439
that's kind of the sweet spot for coco

317
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,919
when you're prepping it and i like to

318
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,399
add a kelp extract so i use germ genie

319
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,679
from the company i work with but you can

320
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,600
really use you know if you have a little

321
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,278
bit of kelp meal or any sort of kelp

322
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,519
extra extract you can put it in there

323
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,519
like a tea and basically just allow that

324
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,600
to kind of soak up the nutrients from

325
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,039
the kelp and use a bare minimum i'm

326
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,480
talking about maybe 100 ppm 200 ppm max

327
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,159
you don't really want much you just want

328
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,440
to soak it and allow some nutrients to

329
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:26,799
do that

330
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,519
you're going to leave that in there for

331
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,838
24 to 48 hours and generally after 48

332
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,000
hours i go ahead and ring it as long as

333
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,079
i'm getting to where it's squeezable out

334
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,159
to where it's just a few drops ringing

335
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:40,078
out that's the proper moisture you don't

336
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,078
want puddles and puddles of water i'm

337
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,679
talking just maybe you know just a

338
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,159
little puddle in your palm four or five

339
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,239
drops out you squeeze it it's good um

340
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,799
you make sure you drain the excess water

341
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,919
thoroughly and you basically allow i

342
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:56,240
usually do as a base um about five cups

343
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,879
if i'm mixing uh let's say a five gallon

344
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,879
uh bucket i'll do like five to six cups

345
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,399
of cocoa at the base and then i'll start

346
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,639
adding amendments and i'll usually do a

347
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,480
cup of cocoa every so so often just to

348
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,799
really make sure it's layered through

349
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,639
okay so that's the cocoa and then for

350
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,120
aeration let's talk about that a little

351
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,639
bit are you using any type of aeration

352
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,879
at all such as perlite humus uh or

353
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,720
anything like that pumice is something i

354
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,720
really like to get my hands on when um

355
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,720
the local garden center here has it

356
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,079
sometimes they don't have it so i'll

357
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,360
usually use perlite because it's a

358
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,879
little cheaper

359
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,600
gotcha and then what's the amount you

360
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,919
put in there with that five cups of

361
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,000
cocoa so if i'm doing five cups of cocoa

362
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,000
i usually try to do one to two cups of

363
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,399
perlite and then i'll stack about a cup

364
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,480
up so roughly about three cups to three

365
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,320
and a half cups total so five cups of

366
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,320
cocoa three cups of perlite nice

367
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,480
aeration then i'll do about two and a

368
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,480
half cups of earthworm castings to three

369
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,399
cups of earthworm castings throughout

370
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,639
make a really heavy mixture and then

371
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,240
basically since i don't have a composter

372
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,120
where i live i'm in an apartment i don't

373
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,360
want a compost to be all stinky um i go

374
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,440
ahead and add roots organic 707 blend

375
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,200
which is kind of like a nice even blend

376
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,519
that i like to add has a little bit of

377
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,600
everything in it has some uh

378
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,759
mycorrhizal fungi and then just for

379
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,920
myself i'll go ahead and hit it with a

380
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,439
shot of great white mico so that's kind

381
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,120
of like the blends i like to make

382
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,279
they're a little stronger

383
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,399
now what i'm making more for is uh for

384
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,879
strains that

385
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,039
um i don't plant my seedlings directly

386
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:28,240
in this mix so generally i use a happy

387
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:30,799
frog just a very very bare minimum um or

388
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,320
a rockwool cube or or just a cocoa pod

389
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,639
or something like that or a peat moss

390
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,959
pod and i'll get them started whatever

391
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,799
it is tomato plants lettuce plants um or

392
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,278
lettuce you know broccoli cabbage

393
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,879
anything it gets started elsewhere once

394
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,480
it's been adjusted and it can really

395
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,240
start up taking nutrients i like to

396
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,399
stick them into my mixes because they're

397
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,278
a little more hotter or just a little

398
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,000
more more nutrient heavy for the start

399
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:56,240
you mentioned use worm castings to use

400
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,399
any type of compost at all usually

401
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,680
people either use the worm castings or

402
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,600
the compost or some people will use both

403
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,679
so i don't have access to compost

404
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,120
currently i just use earthworm castings

405
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,159
so that's pretty much all i do it's just

406
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,159
the organic

407
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,159
earthworm castings i get from my local

408
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,800
garden center

409
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,240
we have a composter here in in my garage

410
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,799
but it doesn't get hot enough for it to

411
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,320
compost currently if i was using compost

412
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,078
i would back down on probably how much

413
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,000
earthworm castings i'm using i'd

414
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,159
probably increase uh just a little bit

415
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,600
more of the aeration so instead of

416
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,120
adding more perlite i'd probably add

417
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,120
some play sand to my mixture and just

418
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,039
kind of give it a little bit of a sand

419
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,799
through the mixture kind of i've noticed

420
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,480
that that's getting very popular and i

421
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,319
like seeing that

422
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,320
that that's also where i might think

423
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,360
about swapping the perlite for pumice if

424
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,800
i'm doing a more compost heavy mixture

425
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,480
so those are those are things you would

426
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,679
want to think think about if you do have

427
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,560
compost to access what you're using for

428
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:57,599
the specific uh aeration tools you know

429
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:59,759
play sand is a very great granular

430
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,560
tool to aerate some

431
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,958
more heavier or denser types of compost

432
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:07,119
so that's a yeah great question and then

433
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,719
how about fertilizer to begin i think

434
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,839
you kind of touched upon this but are

435
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,320
you adding like a blend of fertilizer or

436
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,000
you're doing individual amendments into

437
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,320
the soil mix

438
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,240
so it really just depends on how

439
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,240
what kind of gardening i want to do so

440
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,240
if i want a headache free hassle-free

441
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,320
gardening and i want to do mostly just

442
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,120
having to water just ph my water

443
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,560
dechlorinate it not worry about too much

444
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,560
i'm going to go ahead and make compost

445
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,879
teas once bi-weekly and i'm going to

446
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,278
make them um relatively so if i'm in a

447
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:40,078
seedling stage looking for the 200 ppm i

448
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,439
might make the compost tea 300 ppm why i

449
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:45,120
do that is because there's going to be

450
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,920
about 150 to 200 active ppms of of

451
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,600
activated uh nutrients accessible after

452
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,439
brewing the tea but then there's still

453
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,759
going to be some of the leftover

454
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,839
nutrients that haven't been completely

455
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,278
digested by the microbial life that we

456
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,320
added to that tea so you're still going

457
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,838
to have like a a leaching factor so i'll

458
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,839
feed my plants with a little bit of

459
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,920
higher ppm and then through the week

460
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,759
while i water them i kind of rid out

461
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,519
that excess 100 ppm that they're

462
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,079
digesting and then all of a sudden you

463
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,159
you see that your plants might show some

464
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,278
greenhouse burn which is for those who

465
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:17,519
don't know greenhouse burn it's

466
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:19,278
basically when people take up

467
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,120
plants at your local garden centers and

468
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,799
feed them immensely so that they can

469
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,480
ship them out to walmart or various

470
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,000
places and they're full of nutrients but

471
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,399
they're just burned on the tips but

472
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,159
they're not overly burned so that's kind

473
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,159
of like where i get my plants and then

474
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:33,679
from there it's just smooth sailing for

475
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,679
two or three weeks and then just the

476
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,439
compost tea you know

477
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,278
two three weeks you know every two or

478
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,040
three weeks and it's just smooth sailing

479
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,360
um if i'm adding amendments it's gonna

480
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:46,000
be a regiment so that's gonna be where

481
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,440
um i'm gonna go based off my ppm if i'm

482
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,440
starting at seedling stage i'm gonna

483
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,519
look for maybe just simple kelp extracts

484
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,160
or simple types of

485
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,839
feeds that are 100 ppm to 200 ppm i'll

486
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,719
just feed it with every feeding or feed

487
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,360
it with every every other watering and

488
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,279
that'll be that um all my early feeds

489
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,759
get ph to 5.7 to 5.9 um that's generally

490
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,038
the the range i like to go with it 5.9

491
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:10,640
is kind of my target range for the

492
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:12,400
vegetative for um

493
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,559
you know what they're up taking like you

494
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,880
said it's those uh micronutrients they

495
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:18,720
really like the calcium calcium the

496
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,160
magnesium the boron the manganese all

497
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,078
that fun stuff

498
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,880
so it just really depends on what your

499
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,959
nutrient line is and that's really vital

500
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,240
and that's why if you're doing a super

501
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:33,840
soil mix it's really good to kind of mix

502
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,160
it a little bit heavier that a not a

503
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,558
seedling but a juvenile you know a two

504
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,038
week old plant three week old plant can

505
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:43,119
go ahead and prosper in because then you

506
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,879
find yourself not having to buy

507
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,159
nutrients not having to buy a nutrient

508
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,840
line you can just go to your local

509
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,558
garden center and grab some earthworm

510
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,399
castings and throw you know a cup on top

511
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:53,519
mix it in and then just water if you

512
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,480
need more

513
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:59,359
food for your plants so i try to be just

514
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,759
simple compost teas and that's it

515
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:04,479
so you're not adding in any like bone

516
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:06,160
meal rock phosphate any epsom salts

517
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,880
anything like that at all you're just

518
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,038
doing the the cocoa with the perlite

519
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,720
with the worm castings with the 707 a

520
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:14,879
little bit of 707

521
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,519
soil you mentioned and then just doing

522
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,600
teas throughout the entire grow because

523
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,759
they get the teas get all the bone meal

524
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:25,279
the blood meal and all of that so i'll

525
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:27,679
go ahead and enrich the soil um because

526
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,359
i i like to make sure it's not too hot

527
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,519
for hot from the get-go because i found

528
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,839
when i was adding my bone meals my blood

529
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:37,519
meals my ratios were always changing

530
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:39,519
because i was finding that okay this one

531
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:42,079
type of plant likes this mix but the

532
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:45,359
next type doesn't early on so what i did

533
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,639
find better was just to make a very

534
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,879
not um

535
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,120
neutral super super oil but kind of a

536
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,840
neutral super soil mix that was happy

537
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:57,199
with all my plants that i could okay if

538
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,279
this strains of of lettuce like um you

539
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,200
know the purple head cabbage or or this

540
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,240
strain of you know lemongrass or

541
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,558
compared to my my um

542
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,640
my peppermints or my spearmints if

543
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,359
they're eating heavy okay i can feed

544
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,440
them more you know but if the the back

545
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,519
the back basil's not eating heavy or the

546
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,360
back um tomatoes aren't even eating

547
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,440
heavy okay i can back off i don't have

548
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,038
to feed them this compost tea so that's

549
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,880
kind of where i found my even mix is

550
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,359
just adding the things to adding my

551
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,400
excess nutrients or excess additives to

552
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:30,719
the compost tea let them brew let them

553
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,919
really become accessible and then you'll

554
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,600
see i mean it's a night and day

555
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,960
difference when you feed compost teas

556
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,639
within two days your plants will look

557
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,200
completely different so that's my

558
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:43,038
favorite thing about um organics let's

559
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,160
get deeper into compost teas so i know

560
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:45,919
some people have a recipe for the

561
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,720
vegetation stage and some people have a

562
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:52,080
recipe for the flower stage do you do

563
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,079
that as well or you just one recipe or

564
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,960
one tea type of tea throughout the whole

565
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,199
grow

566
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,679
oh i definitely change it up so it's uh

567
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,080
i'm a believer of changing up your ppm

568
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,880
range i'm a believer of changing up your

569
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,240
ph ranges um you know shifting ph ranges

570
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,600
are what's healthy for plants because

571
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,759
that happens in nature uh so

572
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,759
for my vegetative compost tea it's gonna

573
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,558
be around the you know if we're talking

574
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:18,558
about a a nice vegging plant

575
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,000
five weeks old four weeks old something

576
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:23,839
nice and hearty it's going to be around

577
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,599
the 500 to 650 ppm range maybe 700 max

578
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,519
um and that's going to give them a nice

579
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,639
boost but what that's going to be is and

580
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,798
what that's going to look like is

581
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,200
usually uh it's going to be one cup of

582
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:35,519
bat guano uh one and a half cups of

583
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,880
earthworm castings and then i go ahead

584
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:41,918
and add one cup of blood meal and then

585
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,120
half a cup of oh no a quarter cup of

586
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,880
bone meal

587
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,759
and that bone meal is in there just to

588
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,320
introduce some of that pk the earthworm

589
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:52,720
casting is about guano all of it has npk

590
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:55,359
throughout of it really um but it's just

591
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,880
the back guano and the uh the

592
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:58,879
uh earthworm casting is gonna be much

593
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,640
higher in nitrogen and the calcium and

594
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,960
magnesium and boron so i'm just gonna

595
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,559
let that steep for 24 to 48 hours i

596
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,759
generally hit it with some great white

597
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:10,399
mico or if i um my local garden center

598
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,919
has a brand called mike's m-y-k-e-s it's

599
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,519
a really great brand if you guys have it

600
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,000
in your garden centers it is actually a

601
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:18,798
very nice brand of mycorrhizae but you

602
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,919
always let it blend for about 24 hours

603
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:25,839
generally that's ready to go my flower

604
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:28,559
feeds gonna be uh one cup of bat guano

605
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:31,359
one cup of earthworm castings two cups

606
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:33,759
of bone meal and then i'm going to do a

607
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:36,558
quarter cup of blood meal so it's

608
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,440
basically going to be a pk heavy

609
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:39,759
uh

610
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,759
compost tea versus the

611
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:44,319
you know nitrogen heavy

612
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,640
vegetative okay and those ratios is that

613
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:49,200
for your standard five gallon bucket

614
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,360
with about four gallons of water

615
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,440
yes yeah it's for a five gallon bucket

616
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,879
um roughly i fill that thing to about

617
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,720
four point five gallons i'm not gonna

618
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,320
lie i fill it to the brim

619
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,319
and then are you diluting that tea down

620
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,319
with water or are you just giving it

621
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:06,558
directly to the plants

622
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:09,038
yeah so i'll actually take that tea and

623
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,558
i have a one gallon uh jug that you know

624
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:12,000
we have we go through milk so every so

625
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:13,599
often i'll clean my milk jugs and i'll

626
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,279
have a free jug

627
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,199
but i'll use a one gallon jug i'll fill

628
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,200
it up about halfway then i'll take

629
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,840
another free jug i have for my normal

630
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,840
water get dechlorinated water ph it

631
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,240
proper go ahead and pour it in kind of

632
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:29,439
dilute it half and half so it's 50

633
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,880
uh of a mix that way it goes longer

634
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,640
i make more most of my compost tea and

635
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,640
i'm able to off five gallons i'm able to

636
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,440
feed for you know almost a month and and

637
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,919
i can keep that key that tea brewing we

638
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,279
have a lid for ours that keeps it sealed

639
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,440
you know i go and check the smell i

640
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,359
check the uh the healthy uh bacteria on

641
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,038
top and make sure nothing's growing and

642
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,399
make sure it's all clean that's one

643
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,400
thing if you want to keep t for a long

644
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,400
time you don't want to keep it prolonged

645
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,840
if you don't have good aeration and and

646
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,000
proper temperatures because you can grow

647
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:01,199
bad bacteria really fast so that's that

648
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,359
is key so um generally the rts go with

649
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,360
how many plants um we usually run and

650
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,359
just vegetables and herbs and everything

651
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,959
our teas are gone in like a week

652
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,359
but we'll feed

653
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,519
you know i have 30 plus plants going

654
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,959
plus maybe 20 vegetables so we'll feed

655
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,440
all that in a week

656
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,960
so every week will be a new tea for them

657
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,120
basically

658
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,759
sometimes it'll be every second week

659
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:26,879
because if it is a heavier t it'll last

660
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:30,240
a lot longer gotcha okay on your initial

661
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,400
mix that you mix up are you aiming for a

662
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,919
specific ec

663
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,840
to begin

664
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,440
or bpm

665
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:40,000
is a little tough for me that's that's

666
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,798
still things i'm getting used to uh as

667
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,400
far as like you know i've never

668
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:46,639
i've had organic farmers tell me about

669
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,400
the electric electrical conductivity

670
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,919
with organic farming and saying like yo

671
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,200
if you're not reading current if your

672
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,278
plants aren't putting out electrical

673
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,159
currents you're not doing it right um so

674
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:55,839
that's

675
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,760
that's been the goal of mine to get

676
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:00,240
there i'm more so getting there by

677
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:02,558
measuring my ppm and making sure my ppms

678
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,000
are more accurate and on par

679
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,319
that was the big thing that i wasn't

680
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,079
doing when i was first making my teas is

681
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,678
i was just go ahead and jump in like two

682
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,439
cups of this three cups of that four

683
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,278
cups you know like just so much crap and

684
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,278
just doing over doing it and then i

685
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,359
checked my ppns and they'd be like my

686
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,640
run off my plant would be like 4000 ppm

687
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:20,479
and i'd be wondering why they were out

688
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,640
of range and all messed up so that's

689
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,640
where i started recently going okay you

690
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,320
know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna make my

691
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,640
teas a lot less so when i check my ppmit

692
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:33,038
okay my ppm might be a thousand but let

693
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,880
me go check it diluted okay now diluted

694
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:39,440
it's at 550 perfect i'm in range okay ph

695
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,679
ph is 6.0 perfect let's go ahead and

696
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,240
feed i check my runoff my runoffs are

697
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,159
now you know if it's i'm feeding 600 and

698
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,599
i have a super soil mix like we talked

699
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,559
about generally the runoff would be

700
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:52,240
about 750 800 and that's generally where

701
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,639
i want to be for a vegging plant that's

702
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,480
a really healthy amount of food for them

703
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,679
because right as they get into flowering

704
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,798
you're going to want to switch them over

705
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,200
and they're going to want that a

706
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,918
thousand range 1100 range 1200 range

707
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,840
i've had plants that love 1500 range so

708
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,440
you know it just completely depends on

709
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,278
what you have what's fruiting on your

710
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,919
plant tomatoes sometimes can take a lot

711
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:14,960
of nutrients but yeah i find measuring

712
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,799
my ppms have dialed me in much more than

713
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,558
than what i used to do

714
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:22,000
and then you touched a little bit about

715
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:23,678
ph your base soil is cocoa

716
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,400
and i know a lot of people don't aim for

717
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:29,038
a different ph in cocoa than they would

718
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,559
in soil what do you typically aim for

719
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:34,558
when it comes to ph in your super soil

720
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:37,918
so my ph and my super soil i try to keep

721
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:39,839
it at 6.0 6.1 it's really good to run

722
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,120
throughout the whole thing something you

723
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,119
have to remember if you're going to use

724
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,119
cocoa in any mix whatsoever you're going

725
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,119
to use plain cocoa growing cocoa

726
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,199
whatever you're doing cocoa cocoa holds

727
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,678
pk and will leech it later on in the

728
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,840
grow so you always have to remember okay

729
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,798
my cocoa is holding this pk that means

730
00:25:53,839 --> 00:26:00,240
that my cocoa is holding on to a

731
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:01,839
ph range of around 6.3 to 6.7 because

732
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,000
that's roughly where

733
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:06,000
those nutrients lie and that's why our

734
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,240
plants absorb them best at the 6.0 to

735
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,119
6.5 range is because that's that

736
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,359
flowering fruiting stage for the acidic

737
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:16,558
and alkaline nutrients that flow in that

738
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:18,879
range so i generally think like okay

739
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,879
at 6.0 when one flower hits i'm going to

740
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,720
start raging it to 6.1 but i'm going to

741
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,360
back off and start watering those first

742
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,679
few weeks because i know my cocoa has

743
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:28,639
leech pk and generally the first two

744
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,720
weeks of

745
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,880
every time i switch to flour or i notice

746
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,440
fruiting happening on my plants i'll

747
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,360
i'll go ahead and just feed a very very

748
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,038
minimal water i usually won't compost

749
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,359
feed it'll just be like water and

750
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:43,519
molasses or water and kelp and i'll

751
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:45,678
notice that my ppms when i'm off the

752
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,519
runoff will continue to rise will keep

753
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,200
rising and then they'll just drop after

754
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:51,359
about a week or so because that leaching

755
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,278
has finally come out because they're

756
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,399
it's something with um

757
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,079
i don't know the science the true

758
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,120
science behind cocoa but i do know it's

759
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:01,359
something with uh those stages of cocoa

760
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,798
the fibrous breaks down of the plant um

761
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:05,359
something to do with coconut husk and

762
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:07,038
finally releasing the potassium and

763
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:08,399
phosphorus after so many weeks or

764
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:09,599
something like that it's based on how

765
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,519
much you feed

766
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,839
but generally the rule of thumb is

767
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,079
your cocoa generally can hold it on for

768
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,798
six to eight weeks after you fed that's

769
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,879
that's rule of thumb for most most cocoa

770
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,079
growers that have taught me anything

771
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,159
about cocoa

772
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,720
all right so you have your initial super

773
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,320
soil mix you have a clear plan of the

774
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,480
teas you're going to be doing in the

775
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,798
vegetation stage and the flower stage

776
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,880
let's talk about container size you know

777
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,558
i have people that are growing indoors

778
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,240
what container size would you recommend

779
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,558
for those folks and i also have folks

780
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,399
that are growing outdoors

781
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,480
is there a specific container size that

782
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:45,599
you have that you recommend for those

783
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,599
folks

784
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:50,158
absolutely so indoors you can get away

785
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,839
with pretty much plastic pot fabric pots

786
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,679
i don't know wood pots pvc pots whatever

787
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,918
you want to get uh grow in and get

788
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,919
makeshift with e um

789
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,480
and for indoor growers you always have

790
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,880
to take your grow tent or space or

791
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,480
height into consideration so

792
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,760
you one thing people always think you

793
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,440
know oh i have a two or uh six foot ten

794
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:10,798
i have six foot of growth space no you

795
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,720
really don't so you have to take in your

796
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,720
height of your pot then you have to take

797
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,159
in the distance from the ceiling to your

798
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,240
light and then the distance from the

799
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,799
light to your canopy so light to your

800
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,880
canopy has to always be at minimum 12

801
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,398
inches generally you want about 14 so

802
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,919
you don't burn your plants or bleach

803
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:28,000
your plants you get a really nice par

804
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,360
displacement and you can maximize your

805
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,119
light

806
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,038
12 inches is like when you're really

807
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,798
dialed in and everything so you always

808
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,640
have to calculate that distance so

809
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,639
whatever that distance in between so

810
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,480
let's say you have five feet of gross

811
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,960
speeds or or four feet of growth space

812
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,960
in between okay so you know that at two

813
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,919
feet you need to flip your plants to

814
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,000
flower or fruiting so that those plants

815
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,000
double and potentially don't outgrow

816
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,599
your space generally i even like to do

817
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,558
it a little shorter than two feet

818
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:58,480
because some plants will go 300 stretch

819
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:59,599
on you so you have to be careful

820
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,759
um

821
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,519
so with that height you got to take into

822
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,839
consideration what size grow tent or

823
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,278
what size pot you have for indoor grows

824
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:08,558
i don't suggest anything bigger than a

825
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:10,798
seven gallon you're going to get some

826
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:13,038
monstrous plants i generally try to tell

827
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,960
people one gallons three gallons and

828
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:17,359
five gallons are like really the best

829
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,038
size pots um if you have a smaller size

830
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,199
tents your one gallons and three gallons

831
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,278
can really do great your one gallons can

832
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,080
be perfect for vegetating and then you

833
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:28,000
can transplant to your three gallons to

834
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:30,879
for your your flour and your fruiting

835
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,480
stages and they can be you work wonders

836
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,840
um you know your five gallons you're

837
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,319
going to get into the much much much

838
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:40,959
larger plants which this is you're

839
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:43,439
talking about by four grow spaces five

840
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,000
by five grow spaces maybe a four by

841
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,320
eight grow space something that's larger

842
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,440
even a three by three um you just really

843
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,119
don't wanna

844
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,038
surpass your space like you're not gonna

845
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,519
throw a five gallon and a two by two by

846
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:57,839
four that's really too much so

847
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,679
just know your space i wouldn't suggest

848
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:02,480
anything past the five gallon if you

849
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,679
really want ease indoors um i always

850
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,200
suggest

851
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,038
more of a wider pot than a taller pot so

852
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,038
that you have more grow room and more

853
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:13,519
height to train your plants and then for

854
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,679
outdoors it really makes a difference

855
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,398
you don't want black plants or black

856
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,720
pots for your plants outdoors because of

857
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:22,719
the heat and you can burn your roots so

858
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,640
you generally want tan white or some

859
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,839
sort of reflective barrier for your pots

860
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,399
outdoors uh you want a lot of aeration

861
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:33,359
but you want a lot of moisture control

862
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:35,359
so what i what a lot of growers do

863
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:37,119
that i see is build grow boxes where

864
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,519
they're actually have individual pots

865
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,759
inside these grow boxes that'll be like

866
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:44,639
uh rings of sand so it'll be like a pot

867
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,558
of sand and then the the plant inside of

868
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,000
it and it's like a big grow box and the

869
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:49,678
roots can go out from underneath and

870
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,440
actually grow within the grow box but

871
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,840
there's a ring of sand around it that

872
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,759
the growers can go okay it's a hot day

873
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:58,158
i'm going to go pour cold water onto the

874
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:00,158
sand make sure the roots are cold

875
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,559
so you always have to think about

876
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,399
outdoors for temperature and for size

877
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:06,319
outdoors i mean it really depends you

878
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:09,038
could go 50 gallon grow pots you could

879
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:10,960
get 150 gallon grow pot you could do a a

880
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:12,558
whole you know planted in the ground and

881
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,600
then it's like a thousand gallon grow

882
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:15,440
pot so

883
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:16,558
um it really just depends on what your

884
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,278
space is

885
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:19,119
for

886
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,558
your general average greenhouse grower

887
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:22,719
if you're not trying to grow 20-foot

888
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:24,319
trees or 10-foot monsters

889
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,000
uh you would probably want something

890
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:30,240
around the 35 to 45 or 50-gallon marker

891
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,278
uh smart pots are really really handy

892
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,558
like i said tan tan makes a great color

893
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:38,798
for reflecting sun while also keeping in

894
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,558
heat for the nighttime temperatures so

895
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:42,558
that's that's some things to consider

896
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:44,158
when you're choosing your pots and i

897
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:45,440
believe you touched on paul on this in

898
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,120
the beginning of the episodes you

899
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,519
mentioned that you don't actually start

900
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:52,319
out in this super soul mix right i think

901
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,720
you said you like to use fox farm happy

902
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:56,798
frog for example to start your seedlings

903
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,880
in there so is that like just in a small

904
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:00,398
solo cup and you're planting it in

905
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,919
unhappy frog letting those plants grow

906
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,079
to a certain point and then

907
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,080
transplanting into your final container

908
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:07,678
or are you going from like a solo cup to

909
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:09,519
a one gallon then up to like a five

910
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,159
gallon for example

911
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,159
so generally i'll go solo cup one gallon

912
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,919
five gallon um but if it's like an

913
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,960
autoflower that i just want to go ahead

914
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,399
and

915
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,120
get them in their pot get them uh going

916
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:25,199
or if it's like a uh a tomato plant

917
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,759
where it's uh

918
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,840
it's something where you wanna get it in

919
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,599
a in a smaller viney

920
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,278
more growing straightforward and get

921
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:36,079
those little cherry tomatoes going maybe

922
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:38,480
it's a it's a strawberry plant and you

923
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:40,639
want your mini strawberries to grow more

924
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,278
of a bush in a box or something so it

925
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,000
depends on what i'm kind of doing if i

926
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:48,558
want something that's more quicker more

927
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,278
off going i want to get it instantly i

928
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:53,759
need them the medicinal qualities now or

929
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:55,278
whatever i'll keep them in small pots so

930
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:56,879
that'll be my one gallons and three

931
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:58,480
gallons and i'll just keep them in there

932
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,840
i'll let them get root bound and then

933
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,319
i'll go ahead and turn them over to the

934
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:05,278
flowering cycle or whatever requires of

935
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:08,000
them to go ahead and fruit um that way

936
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:10,480
their roots stay locked uh

937
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,319
the the hormone so

938
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,679
for those listening wondering how plants

939
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,158
even

940
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,759
flower fruit or produ produce fruiting

941
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,480
bodies it's ethylene it's a it's a

942
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,919
female flowering hormone and so whenever

943
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,599
the plants are root locked in most

944
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,320
species of plants

945
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,839
a self-preservation kind of signal goes

946
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:29,918
off so they're genetically a little

947
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,759
easier to produce ethylene with this is

948
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,759
why hermaphroditian kind of happens in

949
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:35,519
various species of plants

950
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:38,798
and that's why plants will seed out

951
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,519
themselves sometimes it's really cool so

952
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:43,759
for most medicinal plants if i want a

953
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,000
very fast response whether it's a

954
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:48,079
photoperiod cycle or not i'll go ahead

955
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,079
and keep them in a one gallon root lock

956
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:52,480
them and then if i really maybe i want

957
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:54,558
some a little bigger size to them you

958
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,519
know those first two weeks of flower

959
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:59,200
i'll i'll put them into uh a three

960
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,038
gallon and then they'll get a little

961
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,759
bigger they'll get a little bulkier but

962
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:06,079
they'll stay relatively smaller i can

963
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:08,639
keep them in a little uh um you know two

964
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:10,480
by two herb garden that i have going

965
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,639
with a little mars hydro or something

966
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,079
you know something small nothing crazy

967
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,878
so that's what i like to do now if i

968
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,200
want monsters if i want some really nice

969
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:21,199
trees really nice quality plants really

970
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:23,918
nice herbs whatever i'm doing it's gonna

971
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:26,078
go from the one gallon to a three gallon

972
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:28,000
proper feeding proper compost teas

973
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,000
training the whole what nine yards then

974
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,079
it's gonna go straight to a five gallon

975
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,358
uh one week before i go ahead and flip

976
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,560
under flour so the roots can actually uh

977
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:38,319
adjust

978
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,639
handle the shock and then properly

979
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,800
stretch out root bound and really get a

980
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,878
nice root system and i usually dust

981
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,639
those roots with uh mycorrhizae i go the

982
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:47,440
full nine yards and really try to make

983
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,878
sure

984
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,480
that

985
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,639
when they're going into those bigger

986
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,079
homes i'm doing them justice because

987
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,679
just because you put a plant in a bigger

988
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,359
pot doesn't mean it's going to get

989
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,960
bigger successfully there's still a lot

990
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:00,799
of uh

991
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,159
microbiology you know root science that

992
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,280
has to go into it what they're eating

993
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:05,358
and if they're

994
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,560
taking in all those things so i guess it

995
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:08,159
just depends on what i'm growing but

996
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:10,000
generally i like to stick at that three

997
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:11,358
gallon to five gallon marker three

998
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
gallons are my

999
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:15,199
my quick my quick medicine plants

1000
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,760
okay and i probably should ask this

1001
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,679
earlier but are you letting that soil

1002
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,440
cook for a period of time some people

1003
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,960
let it sit for a while to let the

1004
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,720
microbes get to work start breaking down

1005
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,320
some of those organic amendments and

1006
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:28,159
then they'll plant into it whether that

1007
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,160
be a week later two weeks later a month

1008
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:33,039
later i've heard upwards of two months

1009
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:34,879
later people after they mix two months

1010
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,480
later them actually planting into that

1011
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,400
super soil mix

1012
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,240
your mix that you mentioned in this

1013
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,400
podcast episode are you letting it cook

1014
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:44,719
at all if so how long

1015
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,960
so i'm not two months i'm not that that

1016
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:50,078
you know patient crazy about it but yes

1017
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,838
i do let it sit so i'll usually feed um

1018
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,000
so if you can picture a little four by

1019
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:56,480
four tent for those listening and you

1020
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,800
have you know just a few rows of of grow

1021
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,880
pots filled with soil imagine the back

1022
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,119
row you know four pots filled with

1023
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,358
plants the rest of them completely empty

1024
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,000
i'll water all of them with compost give

1025
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:09,920
them all food and i'll let those soils

1026
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,440
cook just under the light in the

1027
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,519
humidity and the temperatures and i'll

1028
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,039
let them cook for about one to two weeks

1029
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,800
and then i get to planting that way i

1030
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,559
know the microbial life is active

1031
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,839
there's some activated nutrients ready

1032
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,078
for the plants and it's healthy and

1033
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:24,799
going that makes sense

1034
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,280
i want to dig into water source water

1035
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,240
can certainly be a variable right uh you

1036
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,280
can start with aurora water which has

1037
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:35,759
little to no ppm distilled water

1038
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:39,440
you've got rain water tap water i mean

1039
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,160
my tap water comes in at 485 ppm so like

1040
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:45,039
what are you using for a water source

1041
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:46,639
and um do you have a recommended

1042
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,880
like a different soil mix recommended

1043
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,719
for somebody who's using hard water with

1044
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,920
a high ppm versus somebody using ro

1045
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:54,319
water

1046
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,599
that's a very good question uh that's

1047
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,440
one of the biggest questions i think i

1048
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,320
get all the time is about water because

1049
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,880
water can seriously mess up and grow uh

1050
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,400
yeah so i use tap water luckily i'm in a

1051
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,079
place in colorado where we have well

1052
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,358
water that comes out roughly less than

1053
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,800
50 ppm

1054
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,480
it's a little high in ph so i have to

1055
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,599
dechlorinate it you know just make sure

1056
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,679
i ph ph it right but it's nice when i

1057
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,519
was in florida i never used tap water it

1058
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,358
was very harsh unless i had a water

1059
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:20,800
softener and or some sort of you know

1060
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:23,679
rain softener system or something like

1061
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,359
that i was never using tap water so my

1062
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:26,639
best recommendations for those people

1063
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:28,799
who are using

1064
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:31,118
um any sort of or living in areas where

1065
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,039
it's harsh water and you don't want to

1066
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,800
spend money on an ro system because ro

1067
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:37,199
is the best reverse osmosis is the best

1068
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,119
i think if i could have an arrow system

1069
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:40,879
to pump all my water i totally would but

1070
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,079
i get it it's not always affordable for

1071
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,640
most people

1072
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:48,160
so i would suggest

1073
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:50,400
if you have to have to use tap water

1074
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:52,879
get aquatic dechlorinators to at least

1075
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,000
take the harsh chemicals and chlorine

1076
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,400
out of the water

1077
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,920
um it's very cheap it's it's literally

1078
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,680
just a little couple drops in your water

1079
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,880
and it goes a long way

1080
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,279
and on top of it you're going to want to

1081
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,559
use a mixture that is

1082
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,760
generally

1083
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,759
i'm talking maybe 150 ppms hot so you're

1084
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,960
you're looking at like getting a very

1085
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,040
heavy base of happy frog mixed with like

1086
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,639
if not three quarters of cocoa and just

1087
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:19,039
doing that as a mix with a little bit of

1088
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:20,719
earthworm castings because your minerals

1089
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:23,838
and all your your

1090
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:25,598
stuff from your water is going to add

1091
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:27,599
salts and various things that your

1092
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,880
plants are actually going to feed or try

1093
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,680
to eat

1094
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,039
so

1095
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:32,559
if you're not going to use distilled

1096
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,639
water if you're not going to use

1097
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:36,960
anything to rid those salts or clean

1098
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:38,879
those salts or minerals or nutrients or

1099
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,320
whatever's inside your water because

1100
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,240
sometimes it's limestone in people's

1101
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,240
water and it's super heavy limestone you

1102
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,639
get limestone buildup in your soil and

1103
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,399
that's an extremely um you know they

1104
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:49,679
could combine some toxic fear plants

1105
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,680
depending on what you're growing so

1106
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:54,960
that's something to consider

1107
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:57,838
um so with water problems if you have a

1108
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,000
severe enough problem and you want to

1109
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:01,519
cultivate your own garden medicine

1110
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,599
whatever you're trying to do to be

1111
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:05,519
self-sufficient i always tell people it

1112
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,838
it is an investment to try to get a rain

1113
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:10,480
softener system a water softener system

1114
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:12,559
an ro system but really at the end of

1115
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,719
the day the amount of headaches and

1116
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:16,078
jumps and and and hoops you're gonna

1117
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,879
have to go through

1118
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,839
to try to just get

1119
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,280
a successful harvest or plant or fruit

1120
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:24,320
or flower or whatever you're trying to

1121
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,560
get

1122
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,240
with tap water it's it's very hard

1123
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:30,078
you're gonna have a very hard time your

1124
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:31,358
ph is usually all over the place the

1125
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,160
problem with salts and minerals and

1126
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:35,759
water is the leaching effect so cocoa

1127
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:37,759
leaches and holds nutrients well when

1128
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,640
you put salts in things and you have

1129
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,839
salt build up eventually that salt does

1130
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:46,319
break down and that salt will leach and

1131
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:48,239
cause toxicities it'll it'll shoot your

1132
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,559
plants out of range it'll cause your

1133
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:52,159
ppms to go from you're sitting at 500

1134
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:53,519
next thing you know you're at 2 000

1135
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:54,960
because all these salts just leached

1136
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:56,719
into the soil and they became bio

1137
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,400
accessible and now your plants are

1138
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:59,759
eating them and and now your plants are

1139
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,680
absorbing them and now your plants are

1140
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,359
also dropping them all up back into the

1141
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:04,960
soil because it can't take anymore and

1142
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:06,799
now your plants are just stuck in this

1143
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,559
cocoon drowning of nutrients because

1144
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,560
they that's what's happening with the

1145
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:11,838
salt underneath the soil essentially i

1146
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,799
mean there's much more into it i'm not a

1147
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:16,880
scientist or a biologist but um

1148
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,680
yeah i think we're

1149
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,920
spending the money in an ro system or

1150
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:23,440
bob gallons of distilled water man it

1151
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,960
makes a difference i wouldn't use tap

1152
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,760
water if it's too high i just that's

1153
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,280
just my best suggestion um you really

1154
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,960
water is everything for plants

1155
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,200
collecting rainwater and filtering it

1156
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,679
with a youtube how to filter you know

1157
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:38,639
little gravel salt things that can make

1158
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:40,559
a difference um you know so

1159
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:43,279
yeah i wouldn't suggest tap water if

1160
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:46,480
it's if it's a hard water like florida

1161
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,800
georgia alabama or even pennsylvania new

1162
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,358
york those i wouldn't suggest it i tried

1163
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:54,240
to use my tap water for a grow and it

1164
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:57,440
did not turn out good at all uh you know

1165
00:40:54,239 --> 00:41:00,719
like i mentioned 485 ppm that's

1166
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,358
very high i think the epa approval is

1167
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:06,000
like no higher than 500 so it's like

1168
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,440
dancing the line on not being approved

1169
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,800
by the epa

1170
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,599
and it was that flint's level right

1171
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,599
there that's not good

1172
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:16,799
it uh it did not come up my my plans

1173
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:18,559
didn't like it i invested in ro system

1174
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,680
and i haven't looked back and i know

1175
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,679
there's a lot of people out there that

1176
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:24,399
say ro systems are a waste because

1177
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:26,960
you're wasting water for every gallon of

1178
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,358
ro water it's two or three times that

1179
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,358
amount is coming out of the drain line

1180
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:33,199
well you can actually take that water

1181
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:34,559
from the drain line you can not hook it

1182
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,000
up to your drain you can actually put it

1183
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,599
into a bucket and use it for your

1184
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,838
outdoor plants for example that's what a

1185
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,519
lot of people commonly do they take that

1186
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:43,039
water and they use it for something else

1187
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:45,199
so that's one thing just to keep in mind

1188
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:47,599
for anyone who is uh considering using

1189
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,960
aura water but maybe not to go towards

1190
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,559
it because of the fact they don't want

1191
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,679
to waste the water but for someone like

1192
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:54,639
me

1193
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,639
i had to go to ro just because my

1194
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:59,920
water that's accessible to me is just

1195
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:01,199
not usable really for uh for the plants

1196
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,880
that i'm growing

1197
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:05,279
it just kills them it just doesn't do

1198
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,200
anything good for your plants so yeah i

1199
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,519
love your suggestions go to ro guys go

1200
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:09,519
to it

1201
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,480
so taking a step back and thinking about

1202
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,480
everything that has to do with mixing

1203
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,159
soils you know creating a super soil

1204
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,679
what advice do you have for someone

1205
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:24,399
who's new to mixing soils less is more

1206
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:26,399
yeah don't overdo it just uh less is so

1207
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,920
much more if you're if you're really

1208
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,079
you're going down to your local grow

1209
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,760
center this is all you need you know

1210
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,560
i've talked to a bunch of different

1211
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,920
cultivators kyle cushman eric branstad

1212
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:40,559
um the dank duchess uh smoking with pod

1213
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,400
all sorts of people and mr growitz now

1214
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,960
getting to talk you know get to talk to

1215
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,680
us so it's definitely been really great

1216
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,838
but

1217
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:50,159
i think every one of you guys

1218
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:52,719
will always agree that less is more you

1219
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:55,039
know just go ahead and do

1220
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:57,598
bare minimum grab if you're not sure if

1221
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:00,800
you want peat moss or cocoa okay go grab

1222
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,039
a nice blend of soil go grab a little

1223
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,039
bit of peat moss toss it in

1224
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,599
go grab a little bone meal blood meal

1225
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:09,358
toss a little in and leave it that don't

1226
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,519
do anything crazy i'm talking to you

1227
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:14,239
like half recipe of everything i i

1228
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:16,800
decided to tell you test the waters just

1229
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:19,039
do do less is more because when you go

1230
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,760
extravag extravagant and go buying

1231
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:23,599
everything and go spend your money on

1232
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,960
all this and then your plants fail

1233
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,240
you're going to get disheartened and

1234
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,599
you're not going to want to grow and

1235
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:28,559
you're not going to cultivate because

1236
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,880
you're going to feel like you wasted a

1237
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,239
whole bunch of money so less less less

1238
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,240
less is more

1239
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:36,159
