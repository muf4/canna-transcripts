1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,318
two girls ago i had severe like newt

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:05,679
locko i couldn't figure what was going

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:06,719
on i was trying all these different

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:08,879
things it was showing all these

5
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,359
different signs so i was chasing my tail

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,839
for

7
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,599
what felt like ever as you go i think

8
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:14,879
new things come up and really i find the

9
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,480
only way i'm learning from them is

10
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,679
is to have it happen and and to

11
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,199
experience it yourself and then you're

12
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,480
like okay this is this is what's going

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,679
on right now this is what it's going to

14
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,039
look like and then you know in the

15
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:24,320
future once you see that

16
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,320
sign or symptom again you're like oh my

17
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,719
god i've seen this before i know what to

18
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,960
do

19
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,239
there's got to be issues so just chill

20
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,439
take your time

21
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,280
read my ph and my medium was way off

22
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,039
and uh obviously it's something i should

23
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,239
have been doing more often or at least

24
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,200
more frequent because it would have

25
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,439
solved my issue

26
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,600
right away when you do it yourself and

27
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,439
master what you've got going on or

28
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,920
or fix one of your issues it's so

29
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,919
rewarding

58
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,519
we've been talking for a little while

59
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,359
now huh it's been

60
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,719
over a year now since we've been kind of

61
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:45,438
going back and forth through dms and

62
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,280
stuff and

63
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,279
yeah i think we've been we've chatted

64
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,840
through messages for probably about a

65
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,519
year but

66
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,439
way back when i started and i was pretty

67
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,000
new to this uh i was actually very

68
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,158
surprised

69
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
because you uh i asked some questions to

70
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,000
you early on in the game for me

71
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,399
and uh you responded super quickly which

72
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,078
i wasn't expecting because i mean you're

73
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,680
you're who you are in this space right

74
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,959
and i was fresh and new and i wasn't

75
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,000
expecting it to happen but i really

76
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,280
appreciated it but

77
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,120
yeah you answered a lot of questions for

78
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,878
me in my early stages of growing so

79
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,759
nice yeah i'm glad to hear that that's

80
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,359
cool um okay so uh for those that don't

81
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,799
know who you are can you tell us a

82
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,760
little bit about yourself and how you

83
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,800
got into growing

84
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:25,679
yeah um i go by zerp84 uh

85
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,599
obviously on youtube and instagram uh

86
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,120
but first and foremost i am a father of

87
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,039
three little boys and a husband

88
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,800
who still works a full-time career with

89
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:36,000
the canadian military

90
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,319
so uh my my time is consumed mostly by

91
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,239
that in my children but my spare time

92
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,919
and my favorite hobby is to grow

93
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,599
plants obviously which is why i'm on

94
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,719
this this show with you

95
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,598
um i got into growing roughly three

96
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,359
years ago

97
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,399
um i obviously when i was a kid and

98
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,560
teenager

99
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,680
uh and a skateboarder i i did smoke a

100
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,120
little bit but

101
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,560
i joined the military at an early age at

102
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,519
16 so obviously i couldn't smoke

103
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,479
throughout my career

104
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,959
in the military but recently in canada

105
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,959
about

106
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,878
two to three years ago it was legalized

107
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,439
so uh even in the forces you're allowed

108
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,719
to

109
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:13,919
use or to smoke uh so i got back into it

110
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,359
um i do have like multiple injuries just

111
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,439
through my body from being in the

112
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,440
military for so long and also some

113
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,840
mental health stuff going on too

114
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,120
and uh once they legalized it i hopped

115
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,120
back into it because i

116
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,519
i knew the benefits that i could provide

117
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,680
just for injuries and for mental health

118
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,360
and personally the actual growing

119
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,239
experience itself is very therapeutic

120
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,080
for me too

121
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,280
let alone the the product at the end

122
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,719
which seems to help with my mental

123
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,360
health issues even more

124
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,479
but yeah i hop back into it uh in canada

125
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,920
you're allowed to grow four plants

126
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,518
legally per household

127
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,679
uh i went through the whole process of

128
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,200
applying to get a license through the ac

129
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,400
acmpr process and i

130
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,919
obviously got a license to grow more

131
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,120
than that just to help me with what i've

132
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,438
got going on and uh

133
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,480
and for my wife as well and uh so yeah

134
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,359
here we are today i

135
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,000
i i grow in a small tent in my garage

136
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,319
right now

137
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,239
since it they legalized it i i mean i i

138
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,919
sleep like a baby now and it's helped a

139
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,120
lot of other things for me too so

140
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,119
i couldn't be happier that it's been

141
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,319
legalized up here and that we're able to

142
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,080
grow it and consume it

143
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,079
while when the force is still up here so

144
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,439
yeah so you also have a youtube channel

145
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,439

knowledge that i'm learning from you

165
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,879
from other growers in the space that

166
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,840
have been around for a while and just

167
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:51,279
put it out there because

00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:52,799
whoever watches it is looking for

169
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,879
information and looking for tips and if

170
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,400
there's a way to make it easier for them

171
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,240
then i mean it's beneficial for

172
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,839
everybody right so that's that's what i

173
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,199
like to do it's kind of fun and my alter

174
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,918
ego kind of got me going at the

175
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,520
beginning just

176
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,680
uh i just thought it was funny a little

177
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,719
play on words and the character i use as

178
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,240
my uh

179
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,080
my profile pick on instagram being

180
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,240
packro man it's just you know it's

181
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,120
it's funny it's it's a throwback so yeah

182
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,759
lots of fun

183
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,319
that's funny i just recently uh talked

184
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,919
with

185
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,478
welcome to the grow tent i'm not sure if

186
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,279
you know who he is he has uh like a ric

187
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:23,918
flair he

188
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,439
goes after whoo personality in his

189
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:27,198
videos and on his live stream and stuff

190
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,439
so it's kind of funny maybe we need to

191
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,080
link up a pot grill man with

192
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,478
uh ric flair get you guys in on the same

193
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,478
video

194
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,160
okay you mentioned that you're a small

195
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,360
homegrower at this point uh you just

196
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,960
have one tent

197
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,360
what do you what would you consider like

198
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,719
your goal is do you like go for yield

199
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,199
do you grow a variety of different

200
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,680
strains or or what is your style or

201
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,800
goals

202
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,639
when growing i think probably i mean

203
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,879
everybody would like to

204
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,160
to start a goal with the end goal of

205
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,199
being a huge yield

206
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,880
um i mean but for me

207
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,400
uh the goal is just to be

208
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,600
self-sufficient right like

209
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,758
to provide i guess medicine for myself

210
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,120
without having to pay a ridiculous price

211
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,840
for my government store to get it up

212
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,519
here

213
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,439
so just remaining self-sufficient and

214
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,639
not having to spend money on it but also

215
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,519
like i said

216
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,759
the actual process of it and the habit

217
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,560
of growing is therapeutic as well so

218
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,400
the goal is to just have a hopefully a

219
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,918
stress-free

220
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:29,839
and minimize the issues and just have a

221
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,279
from start to finish a good grow and

222
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:32,560
provide myself with a couple months of

223
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,599
product to get me through to the next

224
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,879
girl

225
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,800
probably save a bunch of money doing it

226
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,759
that way huh sure yeah

227
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,478
they it cost quite a bit from the

228
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,160
government stores

229
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,359
but since they regulated it it's i mean

230
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,880
they can charge what they want to charge

231
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,479
right and it's expensive to go to one of

232
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,360
the stores and actually purchase from

233
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,399
themselves

234
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,560
it's definitely uh ideal

235
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,638
every household can grow so i mean if if

236
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,000
you're using or smoking it

237
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,759
it saves a lot of money if you want to

238
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,598
grow it yourself gotcha

239
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,879
so let's start with ipm integrated pest

240
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,959
management so

241
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,319
is there anything that you do in order

242
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,279
to prevent pests

243
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,240
um i haven't had too many issues with

244
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,279
pests

245
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,759
but i do use the the sticky paper and i

246
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,799
have

247
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,280
come into a problem of mites

248
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,639
at one point which i was scrambling

249
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,879
because i had nothing

250
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,120
on hand to deal with it and i simply

251
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,120
just ordered a like an organic spray

252
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,879
obviously not to damage or introduce

253
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,079
anything foreign to the to the plants

254
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,240
either to try and get rid of the mites

255
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,758
which seemed to handle it pretty quick

256
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,000
i can't remember the name of it offhand

257
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,560
it was just i just quickly searched it

258
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,439
uh online and bought it up yeah and it

259
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,199
was just

260
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,399
just the fact that it was organic and

261
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,000
it's and it dealt with the prop the

262
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,799
issue i was having being mites and it

263
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,879
did the job

264
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,720
but those are the only two things i've

265
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,240
really done for pest control and simply

266
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,520
because i had to right i was

267
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,240
i i yeah i've only experienced mites

268
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,799
once

269
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,000
and then just uh yeah the flies get bad

270
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,598
in the summer here so

271
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,519
put the sticky paper down and it gets

272
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:02,159
rid of them as well how far were the

273
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,680
mites

274
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,120
did you catch them like in the veg stage

275
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,800
or were you in the flower state are you

276
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,680
talking about spider mites right

277
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,038
yeah um i'm actually away with the

278
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,199
military and my

279
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,318
my wife passed the information on me so

280
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,919
it's a little more

281
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,598
it's harder for me to grow too because

282
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,279
whenever there's an issue like i'm a

283
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,038
whale i was away a lot

284
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,399
uh probably half of each month or close

285
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:23,759
to half of each month i was away in my

286
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,839
last job

287
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,240
but uh so a lot of the issues fell on

288
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,000
her which obviously i

289
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,199
you know i love her and appreciate

290
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,879
everything she does because she she

291
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,599
holds it down when i'm gone

292
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,599
but she recognized it uh just the fact

293
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,959
that she noticed a web in the upper part

294
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,080
of one of the plants and then when she

295
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,079
looked a little closer it was in

296
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,120
multiple plants and obviously they

297
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,160
they had gone like progressed pretty bad

298
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,519
because they were moving to all the

299
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,958
plants and the webs were getting big so

300
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,360
she let me know

301
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:54,319
um and i would say it was probably early

302
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:58,159
on in flower when she noticed it um

303
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,839
yeah and it obviously the spray and

304
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,278
whatever they were doing to the plant uh

305
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,519
stunted the grow quite a bit

306
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,278
and the end yield obviously was affected

307
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,278
but she realized that she passed the

308
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,240
info on i ordered the spray she sprayed

309
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,559
them and i think

310
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,080
after it took a little while uh she cut

311
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,879
a lot of the

312
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,120
the dead veg off of it and uh sprayed

313
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,639
him a few times and i think within

314
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,399
probably a week to two weeks she had it

315
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,958
sorted out but yeah that that time frame

316
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,720
really

317
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,319
really hurt to grow but i mean it was

318
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,680
still salvageable and still got some

319
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,040
stuff out of it at the end so

320
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,719
that's good that you're able to salvage

321
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,519
it i know generally it's recommended not

322
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,560
to spray

323
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,600
in the flowering stage but you were able

324
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,278
to still

325
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,879
do it and be able to salvage it so

326
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,240
that's good to hear for sure

327
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,080
so you're in uh you said you're in a

328
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,278
small grow town what size grow tent

329
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,600
are you in and what light do you

330
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:46,480
currently have running or lighting

331
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,839
by five right now five by five okay five

332
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,519
and i've got a

333
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,839
an sp 3000 and a ts3000 both by mars

334
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,799
uh in their rig nice they actually just

335
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,480
sent me the 60

336
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,879
the sp 6500 which is very similar to the

337
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,839
sp

338
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,958
3000 but there are some differences i'm

339
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,079
not sure if they hit you up and talk to

340
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,278
you about that one yet

341
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:07,278
because i know you're sponsored by them

342
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:10,480
right yeah yeah yep

343
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,120
okay cool yeah sponsored by them um but

344
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,480
i like

345
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,159
overall i've been growing with their

346
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,399
lights now for probably

347
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,199
about a year and i i can't complain man

348
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,039
it's

349
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,399
i mean what they're giving me is is

350
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,679
great products and

351
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,000
and the outcome it has been uh

352
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,359
good as well so no issues yet so in your

353
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,039
five by five

354
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,278
how many plants do you typically run and

355
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,599
what size grow pots do you typically use

356
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:34,879
um i kind of go back and forth between

357
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,360
autos and photos

358
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,559
so if i have a cause running photos i'd

359
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,480
probably

360
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,599
i'd have probably four in there four or

361
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,800
five

362
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,120
um and for the photos actually to

363
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,159
to start off for photos and autos i germ

364
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,560
in solo cups

365
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,480
uh if i had the space and the ability to

366
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,399
put them in their permanent uh pots as

367
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,039
autos obvious obviously i would so that

368
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,799
i would

369
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,159
i would have to cause lots or less

370
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,039
stress transplanting them right for

371
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,399
autos because of the

372
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:04,719
lifespan but yeah i start off in solos

373
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,159
um i go to three gallon for the photos

374
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,079
and then i'll transplant again from

375
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,600
three to either five or bigger depending

376
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:11,359
on what time of year if i'm

377
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,040
if i'm going to put any outside but for

378
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,720
the tent i usually don't go bigger than

379
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,000
five just to save space so i can move

380
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,959
around there with them and

381
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,078
give them the space they need as well um

382
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,919
and for autos

383
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,759
from solo cups i just put them in three

384
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,599
gallons and then and that's where they

385
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,120
where they stay for the rest of the girl

386
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,879
uh for like i said for photos i'll

387
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,039
probably put five in there for the five

388
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,439
by five and right now i have for autos i

389
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,159
have

390
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,920
eight in there gotcha do you primarily

391
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:39,679
use the plastic pots

392
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,240
fabric pots air pots i go from solos and

393
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,838
i go

394
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,079
i have both actually in it kind of

395
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,600
depending on if i've just finished a

396
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,278
growing i'm going to new pots just kind

397
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,040
of availability if i've cleaned them out

398
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,559
well enough if there's still medium left

399
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:53,360
in them but i use

400
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,159
fabric and plastic right now my growers

401
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,159
are

402
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,600
the current grill was all in plastic but

403
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,838
uh i do prefer

404
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,519
fabric it was just the fact that i uh

405
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,120
i'd obviously just

406
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,720
harvested a crop and still had a bunch

407
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,600
of stuff left in the fabrics and and

408
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,120
wanted to get

409
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,040
these plants back in the pot so i threw

410
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,600
them into three gallon plastics right

411
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,519
away

412
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,639
gotcha and you said you also do outdoor

413
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,440
growing too huh

414
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,560
yes yeah okay how many plants do you

415
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,200
typically run outdoors

416
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,439
so for outdoors i only had the the four

417
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,680
last year and i had those in uh

418
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,880
10 gallon oh nice nice so bigger pot

419
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,879
size bigger plant

420
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,399
so on and so forth add them in 10 gallon

421
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,679
fabrics outside and it's uh they

422
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,200
actually did really well they got quite

423
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,159
large

424
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,800
are you in soil coco coir what's in your

425
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,639
mix

426
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:42,000
i'm in soil and currently i run a

427
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,560
uh pro-mix hp mycorrhizae

428
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,039
uh with probably not about eighty

429
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,638
percent

430
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,240
and then twenty percent of the medium i

431
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,680
make up just of uh it's

432
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,200
grow four worm castings uh um yeah but

433
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:56,559
prior to that i was uh

434
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,920
i was in about probably 20 percent

435
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:03,119
firm 10 worm castings and then uh

436
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:05,039
70 uh nutra plus okay

437
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,519
nice nice now what do you use for

438
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,679
nutrients i've tried a different

439
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,759
a few different companies currently i'm

440
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,879
using general hydroponics

441
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:17,039
uh with their um

442
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,399
grow bloom micro as well as their cool

443
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,599
bloom for flower

444
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,639
and um and their cal mag as well

445
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,680
i also have some bud juice like dry or

446
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,519
nitro to throw in

447
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,039
on top of the soil i like the and and

448
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,560
mix it in if there's any nitro

449
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:33,120
deficiencies

450
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,078
um yeah and that's it right now so your

451
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,078
initial mix

452
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:40,479
of the um pro mix and then the compost

453
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,439
uh your particular mix how long does

454
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,039
that last you

455
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,480
until you actually need to start feeding

456
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,599
those nutrients in

457
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,639
i usually just ph

458
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,639
water i used ph water for i guess

459
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,079
depending on autos and photos but

460
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,560
um ph water for i'll say autos for

461
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,120
probably the first three to four weeks

462
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,879
um

463
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,799
and then i started start adding the

464
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,320
nutrients slowly obviously and i usually

465
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:05,759
don't even give the recommended dose of

466
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,360
nutrients i usually give half of what

467
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,278
they recommend

468
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,879
i found obviously early on and growing i

469
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:14,240
was given what i recommended and having

470
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:16,958
more issues than i than i seem to

471
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,399
run into now but i find just giving them

472
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,719
half of the recommended oceans has been

473
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,679
working great for me right now so uh

474
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,560
yeah and then obviously adding the cool

475
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,719
bloom or whatever

476
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,919
whatever bud booster or flower booster

477
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,360
you want to add at the end of your grow

478
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,198
i just started doing in uh

479
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,919
probably the last month of flower yeah

480
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,278
so you you are using their

481
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,039
feeding charts so you're going by their

482
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,799
feeding chart but you join a half dose

483
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:41,439
instead now are you doing it

484
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:41,919
is it like in every other do you water

485
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,600
and then

486
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,879
feed the next time around and then water

487
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,560
and then feed the next time around which

488
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,000
is kind of a common practice

489
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,679
yeah that's exactly what i'm doing so

490
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,240
i'll i'll water it out

491
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,958
i get it obviously so that it's uh the

492
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,919
the whole pot

493
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,399
all the medium gets moist uh just ph tap

494
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,879
water

495
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,559
is what i use and then every second

496
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:02,879
feeding ally nutrients fuel

497
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,039
does your tap water that you used do you

498
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,879
have to let it dechlorinate i know every

499
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,719
area is kind of different some areas

500
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,000
have chlorine in it some have chloramine

501
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,278
in it

502
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,799
does your local water have that

503
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:16,399
and do you have let it like have to let

504
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:20,559
it sit out or anything

505
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,639
i just right out of the tap i uh

506
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,919
fill up my uh my container and add my

507
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,799
nutrients and just

508
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,838
the agent right there but i usually uh

509
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,120
usually out of the tap

510
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,680
after the nutrients are added i'm

511
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,120
sitting at about seven for a ph

512
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,919
i just bring it down to like 5.8 5.96 in

513
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,320
that range

514
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,360
and yeah i've had no issues so far i'm

515
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,360
pretty new

516
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,720
to this area just moved here about six

517
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,120
months ago so

518
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,879
so far so good with the tap water gotcha

519
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,039
and so are you just

520
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,879
ph adjusting your nutrients and then

521
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,599
giving to your plant do you also monitor

522
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:53,519
the ph

523
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,519
of like the runoff or slurry test or

524
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,078
anything like that or just going in

525
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,360
so yeah it sounds terrible but the only

526
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,319
time i really ph

527
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,519
runoff is if i'm actually have an issue

528
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,120
that i that i see

529
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,360
or an issue arises then i'm like oh my

530
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,480
god what's going on and two girls ago

531
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,159
i had severe like newt locko i couldn't

532
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,199
figure what was going on i was trying

533
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:14,799
all these different things it was

534
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,479
showing all these different signs so i

535
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,719
was chasing my tail for

536
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,320
what felt like ever and then when i

537
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,639
finally ph my run off i

538
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,360
realized that my ph in my medium was way

539
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,120
off

540
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,480
and uh obviously it's something i should

541
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,919
have been doing more often

542
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,159
or at least more frequent because it

543
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,879
would have solved my issue right away

544
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,159
and uh probably salvaged more of that

545
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,439
growth for me

546
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:39,679
but i do every so often now

547
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,360
check it not necessarily when there's an

548
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,399
issue but uh not as freaking

549
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,600
frequent as i should that's probably one

550
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,039
of the

551
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,278
biggest lessons i've learned in growing

552
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,519
like i read a lot of material obviously

553
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,838
but uh i don't have the ability to like

554
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,360
read all this material and

555
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,040
and process it and pull out all these

556
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,839
different things like i'm more of a

557
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,198
trial by

558
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,000
fire type of learner and i find like if

559
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:05,599
you've messed something up that that's

560
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,439
been going on for a month or two or

561
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,359
you've room to grow or whatever

562
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,880
this or that it's i mean it's it it

563
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,479
leaves a lasting impression and you

564
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,280
won't make that same mistake again right

565
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,558
so

566
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,798
it's uh it's kind of how i've been

567
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:18,558
rolling um and the newt lockout was a

568
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:19,199
major one because i had a beautiful girl

569
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:21,519
going in

570
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,880
and it just destroyed it and it took me

571
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,558
i want to say weeks to figure out what

572
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,280
was going on but it was the ph in the

573
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:29,678
medium and had i tested the runoff

574
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,440
early on i would have been aware of that

575
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,880
but yeah you live and you learn and i

576
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,480
won't make the same mistake again and

577
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,880
if i have an issue now it's one of the

578
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,640
first things i check so that makes sense

579
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,440
um so so the calmag do you feed calmac

580
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,240
every time or do you do go along with

581
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,558
every other

582
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,000
and mix it in with the nutrients the

583
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:51,359
base nutrients that you use

584
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,079
i used to just feed it uh if i recognize

585
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,719
an issue

586
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,678
uh but recently in the last two girls

587
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,679
i've been doing it

588
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,200
every second feeding like i said so we

589
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,080
water in between and then every time i

590
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,400
actually give nutrients

591
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,199
i give it a little bit of calmag as well

592
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,360
but uh

593
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,200
i don't give the same thing not even

594
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,558
near the recommended dose not even half

595
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,600
i usually give like a quarter what it's

596
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:13,759
recommending just so it's in there um

597
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,359
but yes i don't wait for deficiencies or

598
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,640
wait to see anything any signs of

599
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,639
anything i just i give it a little bit

600
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,120
with every with every feeding

601
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,480
what brand calmag i'm with general

602
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,879
hydroponics for that oh that's right

603
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,079
okay

604
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,960
gotcha now what about like ppm or

605
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,399
ec values do you monitor those at all so

606
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,480
i i know we were chatting

607
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,840
earlier about it but uh i don't really

608
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,160
monitor ppms

609
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,798
anymore and no specific reason other

610
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,160
than i don't have a meter right now

611
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,400
i was reading it and checking it

612
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,519
frequently but my meter went down and

613
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,798
i'm not doing it

614
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:50,639
as of right now um for ec

615
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:53,038
i have never checked it or monitored it

616
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,160
and and obviously and actually didn't

617
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:55,919
even really know

618
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,519
what it was until recently recently when

619
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,280
i did some research on it just because

620
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,918
you uh you had touched on it with me

621
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,678
previously uh so no i don't monitor ec

622
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,200
or ppm right now

623
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,200
something i should do because i do run

624
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,400
co2 as well you're mostly just kind of

625
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,160
reading the plant

626
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,360
seeing how the plant looks and i mean

627
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,038
you said you've got several years

628
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,159
experience now so you kind of know what

629
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:15,519
to look for

630
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,279
and then you're kind of going by that in

631
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,160
a sense yeah so

632
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,879
reading the plant and uh and like and

633
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,000
reading

634
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,000
the medium as well not as often as

635
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,200
i said like it should like i said but uh

636
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,679
yeah i find it

637
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,080
just through experience and and i'm very

638
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,679
early on here and still an amateur in my

639
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,359
eyes because there's so much to learn

640
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,679
and you can always improve

641
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,879
but uh yeah just just looking at the

642
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,720
plant looking for

643
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,000
for signs of different things is is kind

644
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,558
of how i've been rolling and it's been

645
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,160
working

646
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,480
so far for the last grow so as you go i

647
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,038
think

648
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,400
new things come up and really i find the

649
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,000
only way i'm learning from them is

650
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,200
is to have it happen and and to

651
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,798
experience it yourself and then you're

652
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,000
like okay this is this is what's going

653
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:56,798
on right now this is what it's going to

654
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,558
look like and then

655
00:19:56,798 --> 00:19:59,839
you know in the future once you see that

656
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:01,359
sign or symptom again you're like oh my

657
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,879
god i've seen this before

658
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,839
i know what to do you know what i mean

659
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,919
so yeah yep you get that experience

660
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,519
problems or treasures

661
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,200
if you could go through each grow

662
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:12,720
without an issue and never have to chase

663
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,600
your tail never have to fix anything i

664
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,960
mean

665
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:19,038
please tell me how to do it but i mean

666
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,558
the best way to learn is by doing it and

667
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:21,919
experiencing

668
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:23,440
all the things these these things can

669
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,080
throw at you i mean and every different

670
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,400
strain

671
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,558
is is going to show different signs of

672
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,240
different things right so it's uh

673
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:31,359
you you kind of get used to knowing what

674
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,798
you're looking for what the leaves are

675
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,319
telling you what i mean if

676
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,480
limp branches whatever you know what i

677
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:39,200
mean like absolutely

678
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,919
cool okay so that's nutrients calm egg

679
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,000
now what about

680
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,840
additives and microbial inoculants you

681
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,679
said you use the liquid cool bloom for

682
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,240
an additive to use anything else for an

683
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,559
additive

684
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,440
and then you use any microbes i don't

685
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,240
actually you know i

686
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,679
i guess i just had the uh the cool bloom

687
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,159
um i've been

688
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,798
debating for i guess kind of a different

689
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,320
topic but

690
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:00,079
along the same lines i've been debating

691
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,519
for a while now switching to an

692
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,359
organic pro and obviously with the dry

693
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,720
amendments i

694
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,719
still haven't pulled the trigger on it

695
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,558
because i i watch

696
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,759
a lot of growers and i and i envy them

697
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:13,279
and i want to do it

698
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,798
but uh i know once you get it dialed in

699
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,639
it can be quite easy but getting it

700
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,000
dialed in is is one thing and the fact

701
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,520
that i go away all the time and

702
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,359
a lot of the problems fall into my

703
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,599
wife's hands and she's busy

704
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:24,798
um i still haven't switched but i want

705
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,918
to make the switch

706
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:30,639
uh but to get back on topic uh i don't

707
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,038
no uh microbe yeah i'm not i'm not using

708
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,080
them

709
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,119
at this point gotcha gotcha yeah going

710
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:36,240
organics

711
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,158
you know some of the best advice i've

712
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,120
ever got was plan ahead you kind of need

713
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,440
to plan ahead

714
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:44,158
so i mean your particular situation when

715
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,360
you're you know always traveling or

716
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,280
whatever it might be

717
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,279
difficult to kind of go that route but

718
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,119
you can certainly get away with it um

719
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:52,639
takes a lot of research i don't know if

720
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:56,319
you are planning on going the

721
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,000
um the blend like i know gaia green is

722
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:59,839
big up in your area

723
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,038
guy green has a bland couple blends that

724
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,199
you can mix in together

725
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,720
and then potentially added some microbes

726
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,240
on top of that or so there's different

727
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,159
amendments you can use but

728
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,079
yeah i mean planning ahead is is a big

729
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,320
piece of it because

730
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,918
you know those organic amendments need

731
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,839
time to break down right and if you

732
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,000
start to see deficiencies well

733
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,678
it's not like you can just top dress in

734
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,759
yeah and expect

735
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,200
uh a quick recovery time like you can

736
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:24,798
with with bottled nutrients with the

737
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,440
plant available nutrients

738
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,400
um so it can be tricky but yeah when

739
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,558
you're ready man push

740
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,480
push yourself to to go that organic

741
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,599
route i believe in you i think you can

742
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,360
do it

743
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,038
i mean what you see and read when things

744
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,439
are going well organically

745
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:40,079
they're going well right it's i mean

746
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,279
just

747
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,199
you've got your amendments in there and

748
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,720
you're adding ph water for however many

749
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,919
weeks until you need to re-up on your

750
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,839
amendments but

751
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,360
when things start going sour they're

752
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:51,199
really sour and it takes a little bit to

753
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,119
get it back on track so

754
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,480
it's uh yeah if i'm if i'm home for an

755
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,879
extended period of time which

756
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,360
this this new position i mean i i may be

757
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,799
i may make the switch and give it a try

758
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:04,000
now you talked mentioned a little bit

759
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:06,639
about co2 you do use co2 so what exactly

760
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,400
uh what method do you use of co2 so i

761
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,480
simply use the uh

762
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:15,360
tnb co2 enhancer uh i haven't

763
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,038
explored the actual bottle like buying

764
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:18,319
or filling your own co2 bottles and

765
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,798
having it dispersed

766
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:21,599
on a meter or or the actual exhale bags

767
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,158
i used

768
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,918
the teo tnb co2 enhancer and simply

769
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,360
because i'm sponsored by them so they

770
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,200
send me bottles and uh

771
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:30,639
and i use it and it's and the ease of it

772
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,080
right it's super simple

773
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,559
so uh it's easy and for me it's it's no

774
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,119
cost

775
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:39,038
so i'm using it and i honestly i tell

776
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,038
everybody that asked me about it uh

777
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:43,119
because in my first few years i wasn't

778
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:45,359
introducing co2 at all

779
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,519
but once i started using it i noticed

780
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:50,240
changes in my grows personally so i

781
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,599
i suggested to everybody and not not not

782
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,960
because i'm sponsored but because the

783
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,798
benefits you get

784
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,798
do you hang it above the plants or where

785
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:59,679
do you put it yeah i have it hanging

786
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,079
almost at the level of my lights uh just

787
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,679
so

788
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,480
when it disperses it obviously drops

789
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:08,880
down into the canopy of the plants um

790
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,960
but uh i mean without an actual field

791
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,159
grow environment too i don't know i and

792
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,840
the zippers and

793
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,278
vents and stuff in your tents i don't

794
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:16,319
know how much of it's actually escaping

795
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,720
because i don't have a

796
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,519
ppm reader for for the co2 as well right

797
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,679
so

798
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,599
i mean it's obviously providing benefits

799
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,679
could it probably provide more benefits

800
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:27,359
yes if i had a better environment or was

801
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,960
tracking the ppms in there

802
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,479
but it's still providing enough that i

803
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,400
notice changes in my growth

804
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,240
gotcha i used the same tnb naturals

805
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,120
canisters as well they sent me a huge

806
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,839
box

807
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,959
a while back actually uh it was actually

808
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:40,240
pretty cool that they sent that over to

809
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,679
me but i've been trying

810
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,759
been using them just because i you know

811
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,600
i have them and i know there's cheaper

812
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,240
methods of co2

813
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,759
home remedy methods that you can do for

814
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,720
for much cheaper than that

815
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,720
the exhale bags are arguably a cheaper

816
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,440
method

817
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,960
i have hung it above my plants as well

818
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,320
as put it like on the floor of the grow

819
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,278
tent like around

820
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:05,119
the um around the oscillating fan so

821
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:06,798
that's another recommendation by tmb

822
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:10,239
naturals you can do it either way

823
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:11,278
so i've done both ways i do have a co2

824
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,319
monitor

825
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:17,599
and i have in the past

826
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:19,119
monitored the ppm and i also do exhaust

827
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,439
once in a while

828
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,839
so it's not a sealed environment which

829
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,759
like you had mentioned isn't really

830
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,038
entirely effective right it's much

831
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,319
better to be in a sealed

832
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:32,158
environment sealed room but anyways uh

833
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,158
the ppm levels i've monitored just kind

834
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,000
of but checking on my tent randomly

835
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,600
it's really gone up to a thousand twelve

836
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,079
hundred so it's actually

837
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:41,038
you know it's shown to to work so and

838
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,439
that's with

839
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,599
exhausting randomly as the heat kind of

840
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,840
goes up i have the ac infinity fan

841
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:49,918
so once it reaches like 82 i think it

842
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:51,599
has set at 82 fahrenheit

843
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,720
it'll exhaust that out and then it will

844
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,839
turn off so it's coming on

845
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,839
intermittently

846
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,918
and so the co2 is kind of being sucked

847
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,319
out and intermittently

848
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,400
um but yeah it does work it does work so

849
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,319
i've had good success with them as well

850
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,798
when i did have the when i was checking

851
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,079
ppms and i was in a 4x4 tent i was

852
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,079
i was sitting somewhere around a

853
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:11,519
thousand as well and

854
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,278
again with intermittent exhausting

855
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,038
because the same thing i have an

856
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:16,798
ac infinity that it comes on when it

857
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:19,839
goes over 27

858
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:22,000
so celsius that is okay so

859
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:23,678
temperature and humidity what do you

860
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,278
typically like to run for temperature

861
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,519
what do you typically like to run for

862
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,159
humidity i guess depending on the stage

863
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,918
that they're in

864
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,919
um for obviously seedlings i i usually

865
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,440
keep it up between 65 70

866
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,120
humidity uh and in seedlings i i don't

867
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,640
have a way to track the heat other than

868
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,359
they're sitting on a heat mat

869
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,919
in a dome um until they get put into the

870
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,199
tent but

871
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,759
until they get put into the tent they're

872
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,960
sitting between 65 70 humidity

873
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:50,480
and then when they're large enough to go

874
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,360
into the tent obviously the dome comes

875
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,200
off and they go in

876
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,719
and i'd like it to stay around 25

877
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,759
degrees celsius

878
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,798
um and once they're in the tent usually

879
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:03,839
between 50 55 humidity

880
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:05,679
um which is all tracked and uh

881
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,359
right it fluctuates right now my tent

882
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,200
because i'm in canada

883
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:11,199
it is cold outside and my tent is in the

884
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,880
garage obviously the temperature

885
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,919
fluctuates with whatever is doing

886
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,480
outside because they're sitting on

887
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,240
concrete

888
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,480
not directly on concrete i obviously

889
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,960
have uh them elevated in the tent

890
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,839
but uh so it'll go it'll go between 22

891
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,319
to 28.

892
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,439
i have heaters in there as well as

893
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,240
humidifiers and

894
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,278
uh yeah so it'll it'll go up and down as

895
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,000
the exhausts

896
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,519
uh and the heaters kick in and out but i

897
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,480
ideally i'd like it to sit

898
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,839
around 25 um but like i said it moved

899
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,319
probably between

900
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:41,839
22 23 all the way up to 28. which

901
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:43,200
sometimes beneficial too right if you're

902
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:44,798
running co2 you can run higher

903
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,720
temperatures as well so

904
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,720
it's uh i mean it works both ways i

905
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,558
would like it to stay steady but it's

906
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,000
i mean it doesn't stay steady in its

907
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:53,278
natural environment either so maybe it's

908
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,240
mimicked in its natural environment it

909
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:55,839
goes up and down

910
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,278
as the weather does so are you pretty

911
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,199
automated as far as controlling your

912
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:01,440
temp and humidity it sounds like

913
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,480
now do you have like a monitor for vpd

914
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,480
did you chase after

915
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,319
a vpd or anything like that or just kind

916
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,000
of i'm currently just uh

917
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,519
i just have uh one of inkberg's

918
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,599
controllers uh

919
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,759
just for heat and humidity and then yeah

920
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,759
like i said i have the humidifier

921
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,359
obviously the ac infinity hooked up to

922
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,038
it as well as

923
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:20,398
a heater in the tent because of how cold

924
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:22,240
it gets at night here

925
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,599
and they just kick on and off with the

926
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,000
parameters that i've set in them

927
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,839
and they seem to maintain and hold it

928
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,599
pretty well where i want it to be

929
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,519
i was telling you earlier that like

930
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:33,119
there's a lot of storms where i'm at

931
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,119
because i am on a mountain here so the

932
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:38,000
the power does go off

933
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:39,678
i guess pretty frequently maybe once

934
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,278
every couple of weeks or once a month or

935
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,000
something like that just from the wind

936
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,440
so i find myself chasing my tail or or

937
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,880
moving plants in and out of

938
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,640
environments to keep them warm through

939
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,760
the night or whatever but that's the

940
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,360
great thing about obviously

941
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:52,798
monitoring them as well and having the

942
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:53,839
the apps on your phone is

943
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,119
right away if there's an issue and

944
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:56,558
you're not home you know you know what's

945
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:57,439
going on you need to you need to deal

946
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,158
with it

947
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,600
yeah absolutely it's super super helpful

948
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,080
i missed the part i'm not sure if you

949
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:04,158
said

950
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:05,759
what you usually run for in flowering

951
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,200
what you run for humidity i mean there's

952
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:08,319
always chance of like bud rot

953
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,080
happening especially during the

954
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,720
flowering stage if your humidity is too

955
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:12,079
high

956
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,399
and you have that stagnant air and stuff

957
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,119
like that do you run a lower humidity in

958
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:16,798
flowering

959
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:18,798
i'm not sure if you said that or not

960
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:22,000
flour i like to stay around

961
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:24,720
and about fifty percent um

962
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,240
but i've i've got multiple circulating

963
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,720
fans in there as well like one

964
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,240
one pot level uh blowing air like uh

965
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,679
oscillating fan blowing air across the

966
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,440
top of the pots and then others that are

967
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,000
hitting the canopy as well

968
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,440
and i i'm in there even though i have

969
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,319
all these things tracking it monitoring

970
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,000
it i'm

971
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,678
i have a habit like i'm obsessed with

972
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,278
going in the tent which isn't ideal

973
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,559
either if you're running in co2

974
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:46,720
but i'm always in and out of the tent

975
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:48,639
checking on them um

976
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,960
and yeah i look for moisture on the

977
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,038
sides of the tents i look for moisture

978
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,558
on the on the anything right and if and

979
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:55,519
if i find it then obviously i'm opening

980
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:57,359
things up or

981
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:58,798
or cooling things down or venting it out

982
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,038
or but yeah 50

983
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,798
is where i like to be during flower and

984
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:05,359
it seems to be working so far

985
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,480
nice key point that you just mentioned

986
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:09,678
is you have multiple

987
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,679
oscillating fans right so i

988
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,200
i actually had one oscillating fan and a

989
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,679
10 and this is on my channel

990
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,120
um and it's a seed to harvest grow

991
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,519
series that i did

992
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,558
is i actually ended up getting bud rot

993
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:22,798
because one of my fans

994
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:24,639
died overnight if there's a lack of

995
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,440
airflow it's definitely going to

996
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,720
to grow to spread right um so it's so

997
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,919
key what you had mentioned

998
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,720
is multiple sources of air circulation

999
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,559
with the

1000
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,759
oscillating fans so i'm glad you

1001
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:36,000
mentioned that one especially if you

1002
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:37,440
just

1003
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,519
fed them right if you just fed them and

1004
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,519
your medium is wet throughout the plant

1005
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:42,558
and then all of a sudden you lose a fan

1006
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,558
or say the power

1007
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:45,759
anything power goes on a fan goes down

1008
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:46,960
craps out on you

1009
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:48,640
and then they're just sitting there with

1010
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,360
no air circulation you'll go in there in

1011
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,880
your tents so

1012
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:52,398
like hours later i mean it's something

1013
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,240
that obviously i

1014
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:55,439
i suggest having multiple fans but i

1015
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,200
guess the

1016
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,880
the uh the counter to that is with the

1017
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,120
with the multiple fans in there is that

1018
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,440
the medium dries out so quick

1019
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:04,879
uh the medium and with the heater and

1020
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,038
the tent as well up here so i've got a

1021
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,200
heater going multiple fans so

1022
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:10,798
i find my medium is dry with well i mean

1023
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,558
in the stage i'm in right now which is

1024
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:13,679
late flower with my autos and they're

1025
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:14,798
they're eating everything up to give

1026
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,720
them anyways

1027
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,440
um with the fans moving around the

1028
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,000
heater uh my medium's dry in two three

1029
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,840
days

1030
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,359
for sure i struggle the same way i have

1031
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,839
live in a very dry climate

1032
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:26,479
uh and it definitely um can struggle

1033
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:28,319
with that

1034
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,240
have you tried doing any mulch layers at

1035
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,798
all to kind of help with the

1036
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,000
retention water retention in the medium

1037
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:35,918
i haven't uh

1038
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,960
i've kind of been exploring same thing i

1039
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,000
haven't pulled the trigger yet but i've

1040
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,880
been exploring the

1041
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,919
of like uh top dressing it with clover

1042
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,840
or something like that just

1043
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,360
uh as well to try and keep dampness in

1044
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,278
it but

1045
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:48,798
haven't done it yet but i think i'm

1046
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:50,480
going to in the next girl

1047
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:51,839
nice yeah i think you'll like it ever

1048
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,440
since i switched to clover

1049
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,038
i know even i use barley straw as a

1050
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,159
mulch layered it has helped me

1051
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,759
tremendously

1052
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,640
as far as making sure that medium

1053
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:02,798
doesn't dry out uh quickly

1054
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,759
cool okay so what do you usually do for

1055
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:07,278
plant training

1056
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:10,240
for plant training i've i don't really

1057
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:10,558
go too deep into plant training i guess

1058
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,159
i

1059
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:14,240
i when i'm running photos obviously i

1060
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,000
top trying to get like as wide a canopy

1061
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,200
as i possibly can

1062
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,480
um and and obviously and

1063
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,919
and i do led and tie branches down to

1064
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,919
try and create as many

1065
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,600
top sites or even canopy with with

1066
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,440
multiple top side as i can

1067
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,278
and then for my autos same thing just

1068
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,480
lst just tying them down trying to get

1069
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:35,679
it to grow

1070
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,720
uh equally throughout in as many top

1071
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,360
side calls as

1072
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,480
i can get right but i don't go too crazy

1073
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,558
uh

1074
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,079
for the most part i i tend to let them

1075
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:45,599
do what they're going to do or

1076
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:47,678
even somewhat be the structure they're

1077
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,038
going to be and if i top it a few times

1078
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,440
it creates some more

1079
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:53,119
uh bud sites then so be it but uh yeah i

1080
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,440
generally

1081
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,719
let them go and and yeah top them a few

1082
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,320
times and lsd

1083
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,000
that's that's it got it so you are

1084
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,240
trying to maintain that even canopy

1085
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,519
have you ever used a trellis netting and

1086
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,880
doesn't like the scrog technique or

1087
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,880
anything like that or

1088
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,000
i have used uh trellis netting in the

1089
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,399
past yeah

1090
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
um i don't currently have one now

1091
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:14,319
because uh my trellis net

1092
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,240
i had it cut down to my four by four so

1093
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:18,240
it wouldn't stretch out to my five by

1094
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,480
five but uh and right now it's just auto

1095
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,640
so i i didn't need to

1096
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,480
to use it but uh i'll get back into it

1097
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,600
my next one i'm going to be moving

1098
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,000
to uh photos again and hopefully uh

1099
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:32,480
hopefully have five or six of them in

1100
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
the 8x4 that i should be receiving soon

1101
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,038
and my goal in that one is to get the

1102
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,119
most even

1103
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:40,158
widespread canopies as i can to try and

1104
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,398
fill up that tent

1105
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,080
with with five maybe five or six plants

1106
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:45,518
in an eight by four so

1107
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:47,278
we'll see what we can do and see if we

1108
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,960
can fill it up and get as many top sides

1109
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:51,599
as possible so that's that is my goal

1110
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,278
for the next grow is to try and master

1111
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:55,439
the canopy nice are you gonna be

1112
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:56,480
recording footage and putting it on to

1113

know what advice do you have

1126
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,119
for somebody who's just starting growing

1127
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:23,519
for the first time

1128
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,679
just chill and relax you know like

1129
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,199
there's there's so many

1130
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,440
tidbits of information all over the

1131
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,199
place or what you should do or how you

1132
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,079
can do this or how you can do that

1133
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:36,398
if you've got the main or the key things

1134
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,119
taken care of being like medium ph

1135
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:41,199
levels uh humidity and temperature i

1136
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,519
mean

1137
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,960
no grow is going to go smooth for you i

1138
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:46,639
i i don't think so there's like there's

1139
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,918
going to be issues with each girl

1140
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,200
i would get i i would say um

1141
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,960
i mean you can get through a girl with

1142
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,078
minimal issues or you can be like well i

1143
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,760
was a good girl there was

1144
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,760
not too much happen there but there's

1145
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,359
got to be issues so just chill

1146
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,480
take your time uh read read material

1147
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:03,679
that's gonna that's gonna

1148

run into

1151
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,559
and just be prepared yeah because things

1152

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,240
youtube

1178
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,839
um but i mean i i don't i don't have the

1179
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,239
ability to pump up videos like a lot of

1180
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:58,078
the

1181
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,159
people in the space do just just because

instagram and post a lot more pictures

1186
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,920

somebody else's experience when you do
