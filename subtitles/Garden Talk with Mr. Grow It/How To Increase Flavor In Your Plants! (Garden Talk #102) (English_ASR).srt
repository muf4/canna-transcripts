00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,138
world both beginners and experts seeking

4
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,239
to learn more about what they know about

5
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:14,160
gardening and how they do things in

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,500
their Garden what's up everybody if you

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,280
Horticulture everything from chemistry

17
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:40,919
microbiology plant physiology soil

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,200
science entomology and Plant Pathology

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,020
this actually Tim's second time on the

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,420
podcast he was on episode 41 where he

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,100
talked all about Bro Science versus grow

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,079
science in this episode he talks all

23
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,760
about increasing the flavor that plants

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,439
produce there are various things that

25
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,839
you can do to plants when growing them

26
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,698
to increase their flavor profile Tim

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,440
gets into all of that before we get into

28
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:03,420
it I'll want to acknowledge that one of

29
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,879
my goals for this podcast is to bring

30
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,340
free gardening information of all plants

31
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:09,839
to the general public that being said I

32
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,700
like to thank the sponsors of today's

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,100
episode who helped make that goal

34
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,020
possible thanks to aec Infinity for

35
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,839
sponsoring this episode they now have

36
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:21,239
humidifiers called the cloud Forge I've

37
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,880
been using the cloud Forge T3 which has

38
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:26,459
a 4.5 liter capacity and can be filled

39
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,140
from the top it also includes a hose so

40
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,179
you can place the humidifier outside

41
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,340
your grow tent and feed the hose into

42
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,799
your grow tent saving you precious space

43
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,659
it also connects to the controller 69

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,640
Pro so you can control it from your

45
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,079
smartphone I'll have a link in the

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,060
description section below so you can

47
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,699
learn more about their humidifiers and

48
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,920
the discount code Mr Grow at 15 works on

49
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,900
both Amazon and their website AC

50
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,180
infinity.com

51
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,579
and we are back welcome to the Garden

52
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,618
Talk podcast today I am joined with Tim

53
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:57,478
McCormick how you doing today good good

54
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:59,399
how are you doing good man thanks for

55
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:01,978
asking this is your second time around

56
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,280
uh so we did an episode all the way back

57
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:07,200
in episode 41 Bro Science versus gross

58
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,379
science and I was just looking today at

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,420
the number of views over 85 000 views on

60
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:15,000
that episode it was definitely one of

61
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,859
the top episodes and uh I remember there

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,598
was a lot of stuff in that video that

63
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,040
she just a lot of Bro Science that you

64
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:21,780
had to dismiss there it was it was

65
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,939
pretty funny it was a good one yeah that

66
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,620
was a great episode I still get I just

67
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:27,959
talked to a guy named Joe today he was

68
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,879
like Hey I was watching your video on Mr

69
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,080
Grow it and I just had to I had to

70
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:32,579
message you and just talk to you about

71
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,500
the stuff you got you guys talked about

72
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,719
because it was great so I still get

73
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,520
traction from it today so it was a great

74
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,020
episode man thank you uh so much good

75
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,120
valuable information in there and I'm

76
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,939
glad you decided to come back for

77
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,039
another time around here and uh we had a

78
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:50,159
real hot topic for you again here flavor

79
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,679
how to bring off flavor within plants so

80
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,139
uh I feel like you know 10 plus years

81
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,060
ago it was all about yield right people

82
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:59,098
are looking to do things differently to

83
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,680
the plant in order to increase the yield

84
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:04,259
but there wasn't as much focus on Flavor

85
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,400
as there is today I mean it's you know

86
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:06,899
the more people we talk to how do I

87
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,140
increase the flavor in my bones over

88
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,120
acoustic smell in my plants and uh let's

89
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:14,098
talk about yield in this episode we're

90
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,500
gonna get into a lot of different things

91
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:18,060
within the grow that impact flavor so

92
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,739
I'm really excited for this one but

93
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,939
first can you introduce yourself for

94
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,120
those that didn't catch the first

95
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:26,519
episode we did together yeah absolutely

96
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,439
uh hi guys my name is Tim McCormick I am

97
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:32,700
the President and formulator of culture

98
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:37,259
biologics uh we're a unique fertilizer

99
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:39,780
and bio SSI company we really started

100
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,459
off in doing microbes and putting our

101
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,919
growth technology into the micro

102
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:47,400
formulations and recently we've just

103
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,139
launched our new nutrient technology so

104
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,120
we're all about Innovation we're all

105
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,818
about customers first Growers first you

106
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,060
know I'm a grower that made fertilizers

107
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:58,500
for other Growers so it's all about it's

108
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,299
all about the culture for us it's all

109
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
about everybody looking out for each

110
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,920
other and just trying to grow it the

111
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,620
best the best plants possible awesome so

112
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,939
getting into flavor I feel like we need

113
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,080
to kind of start with the basics

114
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:11,818
although it's going to get Advanced

115
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,680
pretty quickly here

116
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,658
um so touchless what is the source of

117
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,780
the flavor that we get when consuming

118
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:21,659
these plants sure yeah no it um the oil

119
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,519
inside these trichomes these glands

120
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,840
um is is a lot of what you're it's

121
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,099
reacting with your taste buds and your

122
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:27,959
palette

123
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,000
um but you know there's there's so many

124
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,439
things that go into producing actual

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,240
flavor what you're about what your

126
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,639
palette is reacting with

127
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,460
um a lot of this phenolic compounds you

128
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,019
know only the the flavor of of the

129
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:42,599
cannabinoids

130
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:44,159
um to terpene Jeff mono die try

131
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,020
sesquiterpenes

132
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,600
um those all turn into those are all

133
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:50,519
grained from small flavor molecules to

134
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,020
large flavor molecules

135
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,719
um and then those even will turn into

136
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:56,339
flavonoids then we have Esters and thiol

137
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,040
compounds like the skunk smell so

138
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:00,659
there's a a multitude of compounds that

139
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,040
are within the plant

140
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,259
um contained within the oil and even the

141
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,759
plant tissue itself that that all lead

142
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:08,400
up to to

143
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,220
um to what the flavor is you know sap

144
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,019
content is is a lot of where all these

145
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,520
compounds will reside like the fluid

146
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:17,039
inside the plant

147
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:19,560
um so when you burn the the the the

148
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,840
flower or when you're you're tasting all

149
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,819
these uh molecules inside the fruit or

150
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,159
vegetables or what have you

151
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:28,379
um it's it's a range of compounds that

152
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,780
the plants are biochemically producing

153
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:33,060
um the plant from the time that it grows

154
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:35,698
from a seed to the time that you pick

155
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,560
the fruit or harvest the plant it's a

156
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:40,680
biochemical machine that is constantly

157
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,538
taking metals and ions and other other

158
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,459
simple molecules and turning them into

159
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:47,279
these complex things that we that we

160
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:49,019
call the taste and the the smells and

161
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,359
the effect and there are various things

162
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:54,659
that are said that impact the terpene

163
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,460
profile right so we'll go through a list

164
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,560
of things here but let's start with

165
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:01,799
lighting can lighting impact the

166
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,000
terpenes that are produced oh absolutely

167
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,860
um let's you know you got to think about

168
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,918
what a terpene is you know it's the

169
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,960
aromatics of the of the the plant um why

170
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,719
do plants produce these you know plants

171
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:15,418
produce them to Ward away

172
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,479
um other animals other creatures that

173
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:19,560
might want to infest the plant eat the

174
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,680
plant

175
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,019
um consume it it can act as a an

176
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,819
attractant to other other insects and

177
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:28,859
other other animals and other bugs to

178
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,620
come eat it so it can digest the seed

179
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:35,280
and deposit the seed but the terpene

180
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:38,280
itself is is a Finola compound that the

181
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:41,758
plant produces inside the the oil gland

182
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:44,339
and these oil glands are are are what we

183
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,038
call secondary metabolites of the plant

184
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:50,038
the the plant produces

185
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:52,079
um resin and trichomes as a self-defense

186
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:53,279
mechanism any bugs are trying to walk

187
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,659
through the plant to eat the plant

188
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,978
they'll get trapped up in the resin

189
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,919
stuck and they can't move they can't

190
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:59,939
really feed they can't do anything so

191
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,258
the environment specifically the

192
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:05,038
lighting

193
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,538
um is impacts the the the formation of

194
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,279
the resin gland and what's inside the

195
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:11,159
resin gland because if you get down to

196
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:13,079
like the resin gland itself it's a

197
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,360
sphere and it's a perfectly designed

198
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:18,060
sphere so it can take in the UV

199
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,860
radiation from the Sun and and diffract

200
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,019
it and break it apart so the UV

201
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,180
radiation doesn't touch the the plant

202
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:25,918
tissue because UV radiation is is

203
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,079
harmful to every every living organism

204
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,939
and so plants produce

205
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,579
um secondary metabolites like resin like

206
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:34,098
trichome resin glands to help protect

207
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:36,478
itself from

208
00:07:34,098 --> 00:07:38,939
UV radiation so long story short

209
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:42,240
lighting can absolutely impact the

210
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:44,279
terpenes being produced the the active

211
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,978
compounds inside these these resin

212
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,659
glands the flavonoids any any type of

213
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:50,459
compound inside these resin clamps can

214
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,460
be directly impacted from the lighting

215
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:55,918
itself which is why you see certain UV

216
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:58,138
contents to indoor lighting because you

217
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,418
need the UV radiation to signal to the

218
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:04,860
plant that I need to produce trichomes

219
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:06,719
so I can perform a barrier between me

220
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,660
and the UV radiation what that comes

221
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,300
with with the terpenes themselves too so

222
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:15,539
besides UV can any of the other

223
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,978
spectrums of light impact the specific

224
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:20,159
terpenes like do we have any control

225
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:21,779
over that like limonene mercene and so

226
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,520
on and so forth is there spectrum is

227
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:26,279
light that trigger those specific types

228
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,620
of terpenes yeah um sorry you see a lot

229
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:31,918
of difference between LED lights and

230
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:34,918
like CMH to HPS and the different resin

231
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:37,379
output you have thousand people put

232
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:39,658
um you know the far Reds in their LED

233
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:42,000
diodes to help trigger the plant into

234
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:43,860
producing more more

235
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,139
um more chemicals inside the oil gland

236
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,720
trigger specific biochemical responses

237
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:51,000
to the plant the the spectrum is like

238
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,980
the plants growing outside get a

239
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,679
completely different spectrum of light

240
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,778
from from the colors to the UV radiation

241
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,299
to everything in between that really

242
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:03,000
affects the the compounds that the the

243
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:05,338
plants biochemically making I I

244
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,860
personally believe that the photons and

245
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,720
all the different spectrums outside it

246
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,278
caused the plant to biochemically create

247
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,000
different terpenes than you would inside

248
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:17,820
different uh active compounds outside

249
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,839
compared to inside I would say the color

250
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,760
goes into it the the the the

251
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,060
UV radiation goes into it the infrared

252
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,559
goes into it everything everything

253
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:30,838
regarding the light really goes into the

254
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,219
production of of all these all these

255
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,620
active compounds that the plants are

256
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,540
making that's super interesting now what

257
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,278
about some of the environment conditions

258
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:40,439
now of course Outdoors temperature

259
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:42,600
humidity CO2 you don't have any control

260
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,519
over that but for the indoor Growers

261
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,899
they're doing things they're changing

262
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,060
the temperature they're changing the

263
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,679
humidity the CO2 levels are adjusting

264
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:52,619
all that in order to try to get a better

265
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,599
flavor can any of those environmental

266
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,560
conditions impact the terpenes that are

267
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,480
produced

268
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:59,879
absolutely

269
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,180
um you know your your CO2 level that the

270
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:06,620
plant takes in is part of its it's it's

271
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:09,239
uh the ability to photosynthesize right

272
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,679
ability to take compounds and convert

273
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,259
them from photons convert them into

274
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:16,439
sugars and pass those sugars along

275
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:18,240
um your your airflow is is extremely

276
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,040
important your humidity levels the

277
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,379
amount of moisture the the plant can

278
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,000
transpire at one time will dictates the

279
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:26,338
nutrients being taken up which will

280
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,379
dictate the chemo profile or the

281
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,180
chemotype of the plant which is just you

282
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:32,159
know the different mixtures or compounds

283
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:35,099
of the plant takes up over time inside

284
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:37,019
your your environment is is going to

285
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,659
dictate what the end result is going to

286
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:42,480
so everything down to your CO2 to your

287
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:43,980
air exchange to the type of photon the

288
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,019
lights are going to put out are

289
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:49,320
eventually going to create a different

290
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:52,019
biochemical effect and result inside the

291
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,879
plant probably more so indoors because

292
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:55,440
you have to act like God and you have to

293
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:57,299
fine tune all the little different

294
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,040
details of everything whereas nature

295
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:01,259
itself is just has been evolving

296
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,539
millions and millions of years to to

297
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:05,519
perfectly condition provide the perfect

298
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:07,439
condition for plants to grow and to

299
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,659
mature and you know different latitudes

300
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,440
and longitudes and

301
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:15,958
um and and just generally how the plant

302
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,399
is going to develop and and evolve you

303
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:20,219
know indoors it's so much more

304
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:22,078
fine-tuned and you can really see the

305
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,420
Deep the how how much of an impact just

306
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:28,259
even your CO2 levels will have your your

307
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:30,120
par readings will have your

308
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:31,379
um how much water the plant takes up

309
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,299
throughout the life cycle because that's

310
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:34,320
hydrogen and oxygen content that the

311
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:35,699
plant is going to turn into other

312
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,920
molecules that have hydrogens and

313
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,440
oxygens into it okay so for temperature

314
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,120
and humidity and CO2 is there a specific

315
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,220
temperature that you tell people to aim

316
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,860
for and humidity that you tell name for

317
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,440
and then CO2 level that you tell people

318
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,360
aim for in order to get the most

319
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,680
terpenes yeah a lot of comes down to

320
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,600
environmental conditions that are

321
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:57,239
favorable for for the plant just to do

322
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,700
it naturally does you know we're aiding

323
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,159
in the process of these plants growing

324
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,379
you know we can't really control much

325
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,699
um you're kind of putting a so you can

326
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:06,899
control your environment and then you

327
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,700
put a plant there and it's going to

328
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,958
react to whatever the the variables that

329
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,540
the environment gets to and that's where

330
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,500
your your phenotypical Expressions come

331
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:14,759
from

332
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,200
um everybody talks about phenotypes

333
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:17,519
those phenotypes that I mean really if

334
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,500
you want to get down to the phenotypes

335
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,839
and like what the plant expresses like

336
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,759
what terpenes it produces

337
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,380
um is all dependent on what your

338
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,120
environment is and different

339
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:28,860
environments you can take the same same

340
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,299
cultivar and just put it in a different

341
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,278
environment and the plant will produce

342
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:34,338
more limonene or a plant produce more

343
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:37,379
citrine or the plant will produce more

344
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:39,720
miracine or beta-caraphylene you know

345
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:43,379
and you the only thing you changed was

346
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,480
the the lighting the CO2 and and the

347
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:46,620
humidity inside of it and it will it

348
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,440
will completely give you a different

349
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,600
completely different flavor profile

350
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,459
um or even just a slightly different

351
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,040
profile and just give you a very slight

352
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:57,958
different expression it was kind of the

353
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:00,000
beauty of it you know is everybody's

354
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:03,000
We're All Growers and we're all kind of

355
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,500
building these rooms and then they're

356
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,240
kind of like a part of your soul goes

357
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,639
into it and then you can see what you

358
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,440
did and how a living organism responds

359
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,720
to it my eyes that's like the coolest

360
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,700
part of of growing is is being the

361
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,079
curator of it

362
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,700
um so I mean I like to keep my

363
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:19,620
temperatures pretty stable I like it

364
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,079
depending on you know your lights are

365
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,278
gonna your Photon output is gonna tell

366
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,458
you where to put your temperatures and

367
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,899
where you're gonna put your your CO2 and

368
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:31,199
to directly answer your question you

369
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:34,019
know the young people 1200 1400 part per

370
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,420
million of CO2 ambient CO2 outside it's

371
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:39,600
about 400 PPM you see people start at

372
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:40,620
700 and veg and go up to 12 1400 and and

373
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,659
flower to keep up with the

374
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,899
photosynthesis rates

375
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:48,838
um then you have the LEDs output usually

376
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:51,600
more efficient Photon usage and so the

377
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,519
plant's getting a better spread of

378
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,320
photons across the board and for it to

379
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,539
hitting hitting the plant and Photon

380
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,839
Nutri iteration goes into Elemental

381
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:02,939
nutrition so what you're going to so

382
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,820
your LEDs that are going to be pushing

383
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,100
the plant to its maximum growth rate is

384
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,760
going to require

385
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,899
higher temperatures it's going to

386
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:11,939
require more CO2 and it's going to

387
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:14,159
require more nutrients your plants are

388
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,079
going to you know purple stem on you if

389
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,059
you don't keep up with the nutrient load

390
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:20,039
because energy is going to be used up

391
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:21,899
taking care of the photons hitting the

392
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:24,240
plant so

393
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:26,100
um you know and humidity too dry the

394
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,079
plant is going to suffer to moisture

395
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,420
you're going to grow mold so you got I

396
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:33,179
like to stick between the 40 to 60

397
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:35,399
percent range as far as humidity goes

398
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:37,919
all these Factor really goes down to the

399
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:40,259
type of cultivar you're growing the

400
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:43,919
variety because those are going to some

401
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:46,078
come from dry areas some come from very

402
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,819
wet tropical areas and it really depends

403
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,539
on what you're growing as far as the

404
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:53,579
type of environment and the type of

405
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:54,899
Lights the humidity whatever you're

406
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:56,399
going to be throwing at the plant the

407
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,958
plant is going to buy chemically take

408
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,019
that and create that into its own

409
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:03,719
profile understood so going right down

410
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:05,759
the line of fertilizer I want to get

411
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,040
into that one next you touched upon it

412
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,720
now there's more and more people going

413
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:12,120
towards the organic side of things now

414
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,639
there's people who swear that if you're

415
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,620
given the plant an organic fertilizer

416
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,259
organic regimen it's going to create a

417
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,120
better terpene profile on the other side

418
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,278
you got people using synthetics that are

419
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,379
saying no the Organics break down to the

420
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,000
same exact molecule that they're and

421
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:28,799
then the plants up taking it so there's

422
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,360
no difference there what's your thoughts

423
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,599
on that can the fertilizer impact

424
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,820
terpenes at all oh yeah and this is this

425
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,220
is a very deep Rabbit Hole

426
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,100
um so everybody hang on

427
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,660
um

428
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,759
we're gonna we're gonna go from a very

429
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:46,259
macro perspective of this and then we're

430
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,698
going to dive deep into each of the

431
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:49,198
synthetics what it's doing for the plant

432
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:51,359
and the Organics what it's doing for the

433
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,399
plant because they're right molecules

434
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,259
break down to molecules right and it's

435
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,820
like the simplest form but ratios are

436
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:58,559
important important and the type of

437
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,920
molecule is important and nitrogen is

438
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:03,119
not just nitrogen so

439
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:06,539
just generally speaking when it comes to

440
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,278
plant nutrition your your elements that

441
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:11,338
you give the plant are going to be what

442
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:14,399
the plant turns into enzymes that are

443
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,380
going to create all these terpenes so if

444
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,159
you have a your micronutrient profile

445
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:23,639
believe it or not is going to be a very

446
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:26,100
a very important factor and to what the

447
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:28,259
plant creates because manganese and

448
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,600
magnesium are both used in the process

449
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:33,600
to make phenolic compounds to make

450
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,120
terpenes and flavonoids and and even

451
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,278
active compounds inside the plant so

452
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,320
everything down to the elements that you

453
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:41,939
are using is going to give you a

454
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,800
different if you if you're if you have a

455
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,259
is it going to give you a different

456
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:48,120
terpene output a different flavonoid

457
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:51,778
output a different even

458
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:54,839
um uh antioxidant output and blueberries

459
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:56,578
because all of these elements are what

460
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,399
allows the plant to buy a can we turn

461
00:16:56,578 --> 00:17:02,399
into something so just 20 macro macro

462
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,558
view 20 000 feet your nutrient profiles

463
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,679
that you use are going to have a direct

464
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:11,578
impact on the flavor and the terpenes

465
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,939
that the plant is going to to to create

466
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:18,139
um so when you get down to it though

467
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:20,819
so making sure you have the right blend

468
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,860
micronutrient blend to macro blend to

469
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:25,558
secondary element blend is really

470
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:28,798
important a lot of times you have these

471
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:31,019
um improper proportions of of

472
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,720
micronutrients and the answer is more

473
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:36,298
calmac because micro because magnesium

474
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,298
can supplement to the plant

475
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:43,079
a function that manganese does

476
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:44,099
so you know both of these elements you

477
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:46,019
have to have things in the proper

478
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:48,918
balance first and foremost

479
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:48,918
secondarily

480
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:58,079
nitrogen assaults are probably the

481
00:17:54,359 --> 00:18:00,599
um The Plight to to getting flavor

482
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:05,038
inside the plants if you're using a high

483
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:06,319
nitrate load High urea High ammonia the

484
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,640
plants

485
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:11,879
you're going to have to increase the

486
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,400
water load so much inside the plant that

487
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,100
it's going to do without the sap so what

488
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,919
we see with like forage for example

489
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:21,839
um you know like like Alfalfa the first

490
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,240
chop is always the best when you grow

491
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:26,819
Alfalfa from seed and that's because the

492
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,779
plant has the sap doesn't have doesn't

493
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:32,819
need all the extra nutrients that we put

494
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:35,519
after you cut it the first time for like

495
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:37,379
the second crop for it to grow back and

496
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,500
we find that when you start applying

497
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,720
nitrogen assaults like nitrates like

498
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:46,980
urea ammonium nitrate

499
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:49,259
the plant's water load goes up a ton and

500
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,599
what ends up happening is that all the

501
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:54,119
sap which contains all the flavor which

502
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:56,038
contains all your total dissolved solids

503
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:59,159
is going to get diluted out with water

504
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:01,500
now so yes molecules break down to

505
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,600
molecules but when you start pumping

506
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,940
nitrates into the plant the plant's

507
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,159
water load increases to the point where

508
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:11,700
any flavor you did have is is getting

509
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,820
washed out now and this is why you see a

510
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,279
lot of hydronutrients produce crops that

511
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:21,000
taste very similar because we rely on

512
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,918
our our cargo loads we rely on our

513
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,440
sweeteners to give the plant a form of

514
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:28,200
carbon to kind of catch the bricks level

515
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,600
up for the amount of the amount of water

516
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,538
load going up Mississippi state did a

517
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:34,859
really cool study on forage and their

518
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:36,538
first cut they didn't put any

519
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:38,759
application of nitrogen assaults down

520
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:41,119
the bricks level is about 12 which is D

521
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:43,798
which is good for for like grass

522
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:46,199
after they did one application of

523
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:47,940
ammonium nitrate it dropped from 12

524
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,759
percent to seven percent the brics level

525
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,340
did and that's because we're diluting

526
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:56,160
out the sap content the total dissolved

527
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:58,019
solids of the plant with the increased

528
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,179
nitrogen assaults bringing the water

529
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:02,579
load up so it's not that like you're

530
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:04,980
using chemicals and the chemicals are

531
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:05,879
causing the plant to produce a bad

532
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,620
flavor

533
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,720
it's that we're just increasing the

534
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:11,759
water load to the point where once we

535
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,339
dry it we just diluted out all of our

536
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,379
our flavor molecules to the plant so

537
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:18,000
when you look at organic growing so it's

538
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,220
like the synthetic rabbit hole right is

539
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,839
in order to get the the potassium the

540
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,700
phosphorus all these micro elements the

541
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:24,959
calcium into the plant we need to

542
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,240
increase everything's attached to

543
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,419
nitrate molecule which brings a ton of

544
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,099
water with it which more more nutrients

545
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:33,720
more water so technically just diluting

546
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:36,359
everything out and the organic side of

547
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,279
things you don't have nitrogen assaults

548
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:39,899
the way you do

549
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,240
um these these synthetic fertilizers or

550
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,519
the salt based fertilizers your nitrogen

551
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,200
assaults are wrapped up in guanos is

552
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:48,058
wrapped up in blood meal there's carbon

553
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,798
there's there's other molecules that are

554
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:51,899
attached to it so it's not just a free

555
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:54,000
load of nitrates just getting pushed

556
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,759
into your plant nitrates are important

557
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,500
ammonia is important for the plant to

558
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:00,660
produce into different compounds you

559
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,538
know the plant functions and lives off

560
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:06,419
nitrates I mean hell the the lightning

561
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:08,940
hitting the sky and take taking the

562
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:11,038
water molecules and conducting

563
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,779
electrolysis takes the oxygen in the sky

564
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,339
and the nitrogen in the sky combines it

565
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:16,379
into nitrate to the nitrate train down

566
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:19,798
on us all the time and that's why after

567
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,120
a rain you see the plants start growing

568
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:22,740
like really really well it's because

569
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,199
they just got showered with light

570
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,240
amounts of nitrates because nitrates are

571
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,460
a part of our part of Nature and they're

572
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,279
part of our society the problem though

573
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:35,940
and this is why organic soil grown

574
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:37,379
ultimately is is more flavorful is

575
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,120
because we don't have the amount of

576
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,760
nitrates getting pushed into the plant

577
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,500
so the plant has more bricks more sap

578
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,700
content and that's where all the flavor

579
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,500
is that's where all your Finola

580
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,900
compounds are that are going to get

581
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,419
turned into active compounds or terpenes

582
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,159
or flavonoids or Esters or Styles they

583
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:55,620
all are retained within the sap of the

584
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:59,640
plant and the biggest difference between

585
00:21:55,619 --> 00:22:01,500
soil growing and and say saltgrim is the

586
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,720
nitrate load including out the flavor

587
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,179
that the plant naturally has so you

588
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,620
mentioned sap you mentioned bricks let's

589
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:09,659
get deeper into that I do have a lot of

590
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:11,699
beginners that tune into this podcast

591
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:13,380
and they might not be aware of what you

592
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,200
what you're talking about zap bricks

593
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:18,120
what is that and how do you measure it

594
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,620
and you know how does that really relate

595
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:20,759
to the flavor I mean you kind of touched

596
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:22,500
on a little bit I don't know if there's

597
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:24,000
anything else to be said about that yeah

598
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,099
no absolutely

599
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,440
um it's not a common practice to look at

600
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:29,819
the bricks level instead of a plant for

601
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,640
for

602
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:34,740
um for the hydroponic industry you know

603
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,840
we we want to go for yields and that's

604
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,000
usually where we where we get to with it

605
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:41,038
and that's where it stops

606
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,659
um because your bricks level isn't going

607
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,000
to tell you what your yield's going to

608
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:47,100
be in fact there's usually a

609
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,960
a trade-off High bricks usually means

610
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:53,579
lower yielding plants

611
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:56,519
um but bricks itself is the essentially

612
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:59,879
the total dissolved solids of the plant

613
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:01,619
um we're putting you know calcium we're

614
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,480
putting different minerals different

615
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:05,099
ions into the plant and the plant is

616
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,900
going to have different amino acids and

617
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:10,980
proteins and lipids and tannins and

618
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:13,259
phenolic compounds that get turned into

619
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,900
terpenes and other active compounds and

620
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:16,919
all those are loaded within the sap of

621
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,720
the plant

622
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,299
um the fluid of the plant like like the

623
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,240
blood in in humans is like the the

624
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:26,158
saffron side plants and so naturally you

625
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,279
know if we have if humans have thin

626
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,260
blood or if we have blood that is low in

627
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,940
iron or we have something's wrong with

628
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:35,579
our blood something is very wrong with

629
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:37,980
the human body same thing with plants

630
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:40,558
where if our sap level is thinned out or

631
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,720
your total dissolved solids is is lower

632
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,798
than where it should be that's where

633
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,319
plants are going to start getting

634
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:48,418
attacked by pests and that's where the

635
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,639
plants are going to start getting uh

636
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:52,620
picked out and itemized by the different

637
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,679
insects that are migrating throughout

638
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:58,619
the year are growing in in that area in

639
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:02,100
the Brix level is a the bricks a Brix

640
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:04,379
test is a test that we use to to see

641
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:06,178
ourselves where the nutrient where the

642
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,539
total dissolved solid level is within

643
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:11,460
the plant so it's a positive correlation

644
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:13,140
so you know you have higher total

645
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,880
dissolved solids you have a higher Brix

646
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,280
content which means the plant has more

647
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,340
molecules inside of itself to protect

648
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:23,099
itself from from pathogens

649
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:25,500
um from different insects itself pests

650
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:26,759
don't prefer the the plants with a

651
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,759
hybrids level because they have

652
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:32,940
antimicrobials and and compounds are not

653
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:36,419
attractive to the insects itself

654
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:38,640
um so we we we measure the health of the

655
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:42,360
plant based on the brics level now we we

656
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,700
in agriculture we will use this on

657
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:47,639
grapes to see what the sugar content is

658
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:50,279
because dissolved sugar inside the sap

659
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:54,059
is one of the the the contents that we

660
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:57,000
measure inside the Brix test so we

661
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:58,980
measure fruits and vegetables with Brix

662
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,159
testing to see whether this where the

663
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,740
sugar levels at wine making wine they're

664
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,380
huge into bricks testing forage to

665
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,779
measure how much nutrients is in the

666
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,179
grass that we feed the cattle

667
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:14,038
um is we use a Brix test for that so

668
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:16,400
it's really telling us how many

669
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:19,679
molecules are in the plant at one time

670
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,798
and higher water content means lower

671
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,200
nutrient which means lower the nutrient

672
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:27,538
density inside the plant is at a lower

673
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,278
rate and so that tells us we need to do

674
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:31,500
we need to adjust what we're feeding the

675
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,359
plant to increase the bricks level so

676
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,859
it's just it simply put it's just a

677
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,019
measurement that we can just tell the

678
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:39,359
general overall health and dissolve

679
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:42,298
solids within the plant and so the sap

680
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:44,939
is is the fluid that we can that we can

681
00:25:42,298 --> 00:25:47,579
taste the thing about Hot House tomato

682
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:53,220
you know you have a tomato that's uh the

683
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:54,859
the the the fleshy uh or light red very

684
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,839
watery tomatoes

685
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:59,819
our bricks test on that is going to be

686
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,740
way low that's mostly water that's why

687
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:04,439
tomatoes taste like water now because we

688
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:07,380
grow them with salt with nitrogen and

689
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,960
salts you know and when you have a nice

690
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,600
Organic Grown tomato it's it's deep red

691
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,100
and it has it has acidity acidity to it

692
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:16,798
and it has flavor to it and real

693
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:21,000
tomatoes taste like a fruit and not like

694
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:24,778
a watery fleshy meaty you know vegetable

695
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,640
we want to make sure that the plants

696
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:29,159
that we are growing hydroponically in

697
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,259
our industry are having a higher bricks

698
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:34,679
content compared to having a higher EC

699
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:37,259
content inside in inside the medium or

700
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:39,240
inside the reservoir so it's a practice

701
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:40,980
that we don't see a lot of inside the

702
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,720
hydroponic industry that we should see a

703
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,159
lot more of because that's ultimately

704
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,778
what's going to tell us like where the

705
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,278
flavor's at at the end of the plant's

706
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:50,159
life understood yeah I've heard about

707
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:52,380
bricks and how it relates to pests for

708
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,559
example I've heard that if it's 12 or

709
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:57,539
greater pests won't attack the plant as

710
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:59,278
it would with a plant with lower bricks

711
00:26:57,538 --> 00:27:02,220
levels but I didn't know bricks actually

712
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:04,200
relates also relates to the terpene

713
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,720
content in the plant so that's super

714
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,940
interesting I know you need a bricks

715
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,019
refractometer in order to actually do

716
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,298
the measurements you can get that online

717
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:14,460
I think Amazon you get a cheap one for

718
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:16,859
like 20 bucks or you can get a digital

719
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:19,019
one for I think it's like 150-ish bucks

720
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:21,298
those digital ones are really cool

721
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:23,819
actually do you think all people should

722
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:26,158
be having one of those and testing the

723
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:27,599
plants I think it's a great tool to have

724
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,460
and as a grower we should have every

725
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,139
tool we can you know we should have pH

726
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,480
probes that go into our soil that tell

727
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:36,059
us the the pH of our soil which have EC

728
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,919
probes you should have PH meters for

729
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:40,379
water you know we should have every tool

730
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,960
we can possibly have I prefer the

731
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:45,179
digital ones for three refractometers

732
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,778
especially when it comes to plant like

733
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:50,820
plant matter and not um not fruit or

734
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:51,798
vegetables when you're measuring plant

735
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:53,879
matter

736
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:56,220
I like the digital ones because they're

737
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,260
a little bit better at reading compared

738
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,759
to your eyes seeing it refracting all

739
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:01,798
the sugars and things refracting inside

740
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:05,099
the scope and then how often should they

741
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:06,599
be doing a Brix test I mean if they take

742
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:08,579
a test today for example then do a

743
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:11,519
change within that Garden one's an

744
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:16,019
appropriate time to do the next test so

745
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:19,319
the the best way I look at it is we want

746
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:21,720
to use this as a part of our eyes like

747
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:23,278
you're taking soil slurries or measuring

748
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,839
runoff and that's your eyes for what's

749
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:26,880
in the the pot you also want to have

750
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:28,558
your eyes what's in the plant money this

751
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,940
isn't going to tell you how many

752
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,339
terpenes you have it's only going to

753
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,019
tell you how many calciums you have or

754
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:35,099
how many sugars you have inside your

755
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:37,139
plant it's just going to give you a

756
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:38,699
vision of overall plant health and when

757
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,419
you're going through

758
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,580
um

759
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:44,159
you know stressful times it's it's just

760
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:46,678
helpful to see where the plant's at and

761
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,620
and and and its General Health I like

762
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:53,759
the digital ones specifically for plant

763
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:56,519
matter because it's uh it's still more

764
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,960
accurate as far as like what's in the

765
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:00,480
plant itself and you don't have to use

766
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,640
your eyes but more so

767
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,058
um it's really hard to squeeze plant

768
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,520
matter and get the juice out of it

769
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:11,099
um so I usually have like you only need

770
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:12,839
like a drop or two of of the sap of the

771
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:14,879
plant so I usually take like a garlic

772
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:16,379
press and just pack it in there and just

773
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,880
squeeze

774
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,740
um and it's like one or two drops

775
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,000
because on the digital reader and it

776
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,339
just tells you immediately what it is

777
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,200
zero guesswork

778
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:26,519
um Hannah makes a great instrument for

779
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,460
that

780
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:30,658
um also along with with the the type of

781
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,058
instrument

782
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:34,500
um you also want to make sure that

783
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:35,879
you're using the proper part of the

784
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,798
plant

785
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,778
um so plants are always changing they're

786
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:41,700
always always evolving they're always

787
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:46,019
developing further so I like to do it

788
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:47,460
once a week kind of just test on on my

789
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:49,558
my bricks just to see where the plant's

790
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,240
at and I can usually see a deficiency

791
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:53,158
before it happens by measuring the

792
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,380
bricks just because the plant will start

793
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:56,760
to utilize its reserves and it'll start

794
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,320
to

795
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:00,000
um

796
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:01,619
it'll tell you it'd be kind of be like a

797
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,240
quick a quick tip before the plant you

798
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:05,879
know starts to show speckling or a plant

799
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,038
starts to show yellowing leaves but you

800
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,840
know once a week Works once every other

801
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:12,298
week also works

802
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,879
um just the plant changes so fast so

803
00:30:12,298 --> 00:30:17,460
often that you just want to have just a

804
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,080
frequent and like it takes two seconds

805
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,480
um you can take a leaf or take a petiole

806
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:24,960
which is probably the better place to to

807
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:27,360
take the the con the sample from

808
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,038
um and then press it and get a drop or

809
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,658
two out and let the reading tell you

810
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:31,980
where you're at okay that's pretty

811
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:35,220
straightforward

812
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:37,319
I do want to work back to the fertilizer

813
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,579
question because I have a follow-up

814
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:39,898
question on that one I know there's

815
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:41,398
going to be some people who in the

816
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:43,199
comments who are going to be um

817
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:46,439
distraught maybe that's that's a good

818
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,380
word for it hearing that information but

819
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,320
really my question is how do consumers

820
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,460
kind of avoid the bad fertilizers right

821
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,599
is there something that they can look on

822
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,940
the back of the bottle and they could

823
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:58,500
see like okay this includes this I know

824
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,200
this is going to be a harmful form of

825
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,359
nitrogen that that Tim had mentioned you

826
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,399
know how do they establish what's good

827
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,079
and what's bad as far as fertilizers

828
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:08,699
sure

829
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:11,519
um you can look at the back label and

830
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,679
look at the nitrate load go to the

831
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,139
guaranteed analysis and look at how much

832
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,059
of the nitrogen is nitrate derived how

833
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,100
much of a urea derived how much of it is

834
00:31:18,058 --> 00:31:22,440
ammonia derived

835
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:25,439
um I prefer carbon-based nitrogen which

836
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:28,259
is protein nitrogen you do need a you do

837
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,580
need a source of of nitrates usually

838
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:32,038
it's in your soil with like what you

839
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:34,199
amend it with so you don't need to add

840
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:36,179
nitrates on top but the best way if

841
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,798
you're looking at bottled fertilizer is

842
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:39,899
look at your nitrate load look if

843
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:42,000
they're using any amino acids or if

844
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,639
they're using any type of protein

845
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,839
nitrogen in there

846
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:49,440
that's first and foremost second

847
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:51,538
secondarily uh look for ingredients that

848
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,038
are that are natural that are carbon

849
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:53,700
derived

850
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,339
um

851
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:59,220
one of the biggest factors on the plant

852
00:31:56,339 --> 00:32:01,619
producing terpenes and other other

853
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,538
carbon-based molecules is the amount of

854
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:06,678
carbon you're feeding it and with

855
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:09,898
Organic soils you can have you know

856
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:11,580
humus and compost and worm castings in

857
00:32:09,898 --> 00:32:13,379
there that are constantly leaching

858
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:16,859
carbon for the plant to take up and to

859
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:19,260
turn into your terpenes and flavonoids

860
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:21,418
and active molecules

861
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:23,038
um so you know make sure biggest thing

862
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:24,419
is making sure you're not just using

863
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:26,278
salts

864
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:28,320
making sure there's some type of carbon

865
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,819
form in there

866
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,740
um you know

867
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:33,019
if you see everything derived from

868
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:37,339
nitrate

869
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:40,200
phosphates EDTA micronutrients

870
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:42,000
you're gonna have a high a high water

871
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:46,440
low to getting into your plant and I

872
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,839
wouldn't call it bad fertilizers per se

873
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,340
um I would I would mostly just put them

874
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:52,019
in a specific category they're

875
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:53,459
conventional fertilizers and they're

876
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:54,839
going to do what conventional products

877
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,600
do

878
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,158
um which is create a high biomass but a

879
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:01,319
low bricks content which means you're

880
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,179
going to yield really well it's all

881
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:04,980
going to taste like cardboard it's all

882
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:07,679
going to taste like water

883
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:09,140
um you're like growing tomatoes in soil

884
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,340
compared to growing tomatoes

885
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:14,340
hydroponically with some of these bad

886
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:15,898
fertilizers your your tomatoes grown

887
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:17,459
hydroponically with these with these

888
00:33:15,898 --> 00:33:19,979
salt Blends are going to come out very

889
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:23,038
Bland in flavor you know that's why we

890
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:25,079
see bad tomatoes everywhere now because

891
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:27,359
they're all grown with salts and that's

892
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:28,139
why you know you grow

893
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,379
um

894
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:33,179
a tomato with with Organic Soil with

895
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:36,240
amendments with carbon-based nutrients

896
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:37,740
you're going to have the the acidity

897
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,419
increase you're going to have all the

898
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,000
antioxidants increase you're gonna have

899
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:43,259
all the active molecules inside any of

900
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,440
the fruits and vegetables are going to

901
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:48,419
go off the chart by using ingredients

902
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,120
that are more carbon based so if you see

903
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:54,120
Rock phosphate right A lot of times

904
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:56,639
these Rock phosphates are are are are

905
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:58,678
good because they slowly slowly Leach

906
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:02,399
phosphorus into the soil which allows

907
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,840
the microorganisms to to start feeding

908
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,000
on the Rock phosphate and the

909
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,558
microorganisms will start exuding all

910
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,378
these different carbon-based molecules

911
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:14,039
if we just use salts to grow plants the

912
00:34:10,378 --> 00:34:17,098
plant doesn't have any carbon to use

913
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:19,139
to convert into terpenes so your terpene

914
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:20,760
synthesis your pathway goes from

915
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:23,599
monoterpenes all the way over to

916
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,639
sesquiterpenes small to large

917
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,440
terpene molecules the plant only has a

918
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,240
certain amount of carbon it's going to

919
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,320
make it into small lightweight molecules

920
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,739
and you're not going to have the

921
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:38,519
spectrum that uh plant with the carbon

922
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:41,059
load is going to be able to create so

923
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:44,239
um long story short is is is

924
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:46,259
tend to tailor away from nitrate-based

925
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,418
fertilizer systems and so if you're

926
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,000
looking at the back of the label just go

927
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:52,378
with the low nitrate profile you know

928
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,760
usually that means you're going to be

929
00:34:52,378 --> 00:34:55,338
top dressing usually that means you're

930
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,060
going to be using

931
00:34:55,338 --> 00:34:59,519
protein-based nitrogen but it's

932
00:34:57,059 --> 00:35:03,299
important to start making that change

933
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:05,699
now compared to continue producing the

934
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:08,160
same crop with the same flavor as

935
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:10,139
everybody else and and not be satisfied

936
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,838
so I mean nitrates are good for

937
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:15,299
producing bioass nitrates are not good

938
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:16,799
for producing a bricks content like I

939
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,420
said we saw and so at the end of that

940
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,920
Mississippi State study that I I

941
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,619
mentioned before

942
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,260
I did the three applications of

943
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:28,440
urea ammonium nitrate as one control as

944
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:30,720
ammonium nitrate as another control and

945
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,579
then just left the crop by itself and it

946
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:36,179
went from with every application of a

947
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:38,400
nitrogen assault it went from 12 bricks

948
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:41,699
content which is good down to seven

949
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,980
percent down to six percent down to low

950
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:46,078
six percent by the third application so

951
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:49,079
cut your bricks level in half but your

952
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,820
yield almost doubled

953
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,140
um compared to the control so it really

954
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,480
is trying it's what you're gonna what

955
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:56,219
you're going for right not so nice to

956
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,679
have a hard time with the bad fertilizer

957
00:35:56,219 --> 00:36:00,539
thing because it's not bad it's just

958
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:02,639
conventional and it's just going to give

959
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:04,019
you uh it's just going to give you a

960
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:05,879
specific result and we should just go

961
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:07,679
into it knowing that we're going to get

962
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,599
a lackluster crop in the end but we're

963
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:12,239
going to get a lot out of it understood

964
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,280
hey man you you make me think because I

965
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:15,899
did learn a little bit about terpenes in

966
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,240
school I went to Utah State University

967
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,280
just their online program for their

968
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:23,279
cultivation certificates under Dr Bruce

969
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,540
bugby and there is a video on terpene

970
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,160
synthesis and so I learned about the

971
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:27,838
five carbon building block terpene and

972
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,940
then you've got 10 carbon building block

973
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:32,159
and 15 carbon building block right you

974
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,380
just mentioned those what I learned is

975
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,699
that what you just said is that these

976
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,500
fertilizer programs they're building

977
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:39,000
just five carbon they're mostly going to

978
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,579
build a five carbon building block right

979
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,940
those are more volatile so you're more

980
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:46,560
likely to lose those than the 10 or the

981
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,179
15 carbon block terpenes and I don't

982
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:49,799
have all the memorize which ones are

983
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:51,899
which you know know what's laminate

984
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,579
what's mercy and so on and so forth but

985
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,320
it just got me thinking a little bit if

986
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:57,420
the fertilizer if the sulfate

987
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,820
fertilizers that you're using is causing

988
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:02,338
the plant to create more five carbon

989
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:04,079
building block terpenes well then you

990
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:06,239
more chance of losing them particularly

991
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,160
during like drying curing storing and

992
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:10,559
stuff like that I'm still consuming

993
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,659
medicine uh from a year ago that I've

994
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:15,838
had cured up and that's just because the

995
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:18,299
the car are carbon-based nutrients give

996
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:20,219
massive amounts of very very small forms

997
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,920
of carbon that the plant can use to turn

998
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:24,659
into those 15 carbon building blocks

999
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,579
um for those terpenes or for the

1000
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:28,739
flavonoids and mind you it will go from

1001
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:30,720
the small terpenes to the large terpenes

1002
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:32,759
and that's the same pathway all the way

1003
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:34,919
through then it goes to flavonoids and

1004
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,020
then it goes to more complex Esters and

1005
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,720
it's this daisy chain effect and if the

1006
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:42,059
plant is deficient on carbon the plant

1007
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:44,338
is only going to use whatever carbon it

1008
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:46,679
can to create small molecules and not

1009
00:37:44,338 --> 00:37:48,599
give you the the shelf life like some of

1010
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:49,699
these other molecules like these longer

1011
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,680
15

1012
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:55,139
carbon chain molecules can and I think

1013
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:58,739
that's really goes to show like

1014
00:37:55,139 --> 00:38:01,379
um what what nutrients can really do in

1015
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:04,199
in the production of of

1016
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:06,320
terpenes but there's another study out

1017
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:09,179
there showing the relationship between

1018
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:12,119
magnesium and manganese and how the

1019
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:14,399
plant produced more developed more more

1020
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:17,519
longer change terpenes was just the

1021
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,559
addition of magnesium to the manganese

1022
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:22,139
and it kind of goes to show that like

1023
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:25,380
whatever the bio the biochemical process

1024
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:27,420
making all these terpenes and flavonoids

1025
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,940
inside the plant really they really

1026
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:32,579
really does depend on the nutrient

1027
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,440
content that the plant has or do what

1028
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:36,660
what's the balance of micronutrients the

1029
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,639
secondary elements well how much carbon

1030
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:41,219
content does the plant have to take up

1031
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:43,739
and to use as precursors

1032
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:46,799
um so it really comes down to I think

1033
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:48,959
the the what you're giving the plant for

1034
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,119
it to be able to create in the end are

1035
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,460
you giving it nitrates that are going to

1036
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,720
be really good for biomass creation but

1037
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,760
it's not going to give the plant very

1038
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,858
much as far as like terpene synthesis or

1039
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,560
flavonoid or any of these other active

1040
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:04,139
molecule antioxidant compounds and

1041
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:05,400
blueberries you know

1042
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:08,578
um I think I think it really comes down

1043
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:11,039
to you get you get out what you put in

1044
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:13,079
type of thing it's wild yeah learn it

1045
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,000
learn so much on this one and just

1046
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:16,500
connecting the dots on a lot of things

1047
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,659
let's move on there's a few more things

1048
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,420
that certainly can impact terpenes that

1049
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:23,039
I want to get into so microbiology I've

1050
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:25,500
heard that you know the microbes in the

1051
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,659
soil can actually impact the terpene

1052
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,760
profile number one is that true number

1053
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:32,639
two is there a specific Consortium of

1054
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,400
microbes that impact the flavor certain

1055
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:36,598
terpenes being produced I would say all

1056
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,780
microbes

1057
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:42,599
I mean the the really cool part about

1058
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:44,880
microbes is they really exude

1059
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,760
purely carbon-based molecules

1060
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,280
all our enzymes carbon based all their

1061
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,099
organic acids carbon-based acetic acid

1062
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:56,460
acetobacter bacteria acetic acid is

1063
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:58,260
extremely important for the for as a

1064
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:01,679
simple acid for the plant to turn into

1065
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:04,079
all its biological molecules carboxylic

1066
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,819
acids are are what the plant will

1067
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,980
release from the root system to go find

1068
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:10,260
elements and once these carboxylic acids

1069
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:12,119
the root oxidates match up with these

1070
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,440
elements it sends a flag saying hey I'm

1071
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:16,140
one of yours and the plant can take it

1072
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,358
up at that point bacteria and then fungi

1073
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:20,940
even break down molecules consume them

1074
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:23,460
wrap them into carbon and excrete them

1075
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:26,579
out into a carbon-based molecule so

1076
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:27,240
that's really why all of these

1077
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:29,099
um

1078
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:30,179
all these microorganisms throughout the

1079
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:31,980
world

1080
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:33,960
um indigenously inside the soil and the

1081
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:37,920
ones we're using will have an impact on

1082
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,720
on the flavor produced inside the crop

1083
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,579
um there's I can't remember who did it

1084
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:43,319
but there was a study how to find it

1085
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:46,619
I'll send it to you it's a really cool

1086
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:49,320
study on uh grapes and they're making

1087
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:50,700
wines out of I think it's in Chile and

1088
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,039
they're making wines out of two

1089
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:54,719
different soil compost the two different

1090
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:56,759
three two three different regions of

1091
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,939
soil what they ended up doing is taking

1092
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:03,480
these regions of soil growing

1093
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:06,059
um a crop in it with the microbes are

1094
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,740
thriving and they took the same soil and

1095
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:09,779
they they nuked it they completely

1096
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:12,598
killed any contortion and they made a

1097
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:15,420
sterile soil out of it the the bricks

1098
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:17,640
level in in the grapes when they measure

1099
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:20,280
the sugar content it was like half

1100
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:22,500
the sugar content the normal the normal

1101
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,019
grapes were in fact they had way less

1102
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,880
tannins they had way less all the whole

1103
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:28,800
spectrum of molecules completely changed

1104
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,380
within the grape plant all because they

1105
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,060
sterilized the soil uh so I would even

1106
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:35,760
go into saying that like you know the

1107
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:36,719
the soil profile itself is really

1108
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,820
important

1109
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:40,199
um it's like grapes grown in France is

1110
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,000
different than grapes growing in Chile

1111
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:43,500
and chili grapes are different than the

1112
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,159
ones and

1113
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:49,858
um Italy and you see that

1114
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:52,858
not only does the the complex the the

1115
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:54,960
elements inside the soil matter but what

1116
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:57,420
really really comes down to is the

1117
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,980
spectrum of microorganisms inside the

1118
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,599
soil because that's what produces all

1119
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,699
the carbon-based molecules around the

1120
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:04,859
root system that the plant's going to

1121
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:07,259
take up and to turn into all these

1122
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:09,299
flavors and and all these dissolved

1123
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:11,460
solids within the plant itself so the

1124
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,440
microbes play I would say just as big as

1125
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,300
a role as the elements you put into the

1126
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,280
plant as far as

1127
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,359
um how the plant the flavor profile is

1128
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,560
going to come out and the terpene

1129
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:21,000
production is going to come out and the

1130
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:22,739
sugar content is going to be produced

1131
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,960
inside the crop what are your thoughts

1132
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:27,179
on like the bottled microbial inocula

1133
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,099
instead of being sold that are kind of a

1134
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:31,379
lot of more limited in the diversity

1135
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:33,539
versus if you go out your backyard do

1136
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:37,260
the IMO process you can get so much more

1137
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:39,358
diversity yeah I think it the the more

1138
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:42,960
diverse complex of microorganisms you

1139
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:45,358
have the more complex the Aromas and the

1140
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,039
flavors are going to come out

1141
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:50,699
um I also think that goes into active

1142
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:51,838
compound synthesis so uh making all the

1143
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:53,219
favorite compounds we have in our

1144
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:54,779
medicinal plants and all the

1145
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:56,639
antioxidants and the blueberries and

1146
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:59,040
things that keep us healthy

1147
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:01,920
um really come down to the Consortium of

1148
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:04,559
bacteria and fungi and Archaea and and

1149
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,659
nematodes and and everything protozoa

1150
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,338
and all the the organisms that are part

1151
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:10,440
of their food chain that they all eat

1152
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:12,779
each other and cycle through inside the

1153
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,880
soil I think all of those really go down

1154
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,200
to

1155
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,338
getting the plant access remember it's

1156
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:19,919
about what you get out what you put in

1157
00:43:17,338 --> 00:43:23,059
so all those those little machines those

1158
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:26,159
little microbes are giving the plant a a

1159
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:27,838
wide variety of Consortium of organic

1160
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:29,279
molecules carbon-based molecules that

1161
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,559
the plant can take up and synthesize

1162
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,380
into whatever they want that's why an

1163
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:35,940
inoculated crop whether it's a bottle or

1164
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,079
whether you use indigenous soils they're

1165
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:40,260
always going to produce a better flavor

1166
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:42,720
crop than using a sterilizing agent like

1167
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:44,520
cleanse all the time and just constantly

1168
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:47,699
nuking everything and you just depend

1169
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:51,059
has no available organic compound to

1170
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:54,318
synthesize as a precursor into these

1171
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:58,199
flavors into the the sugars into

1172
00:43:54,318 --> 00:44:00,900
the terpenes I mean I like a lot of the

1173
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:02,818
the bottles of inoculants out there I

1174
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:05,760
think you're always going to get a

1175
00:44:02,818 --> 00:44:08,219
better profile inside an indigenous soil

1176
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,079
and just curating that indigenous soil

1177
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:12,299
with other carbon-based ingredients

1178
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:15,180
prebiotics

1179
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:17,940
implant proteins animal proteins things

1180
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:18,980
that can wake wake up the soil

1181
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,940
essentially

1182
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:23,219
you're always going to have a way better

1183
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,900
consortia of organic compounds around

1184
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:27,179
your plants with all those microbes

1185
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:30,260
breeding and growing like crazy compared

1186
00:44:27,179 --> 00:44:32,818
to a sterilized

1187
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:35,760
athena-based crop you know where they

1188
00:44:32,818 --> 00:44:37,199
they pre they push sterility in your

1189
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,700
Grow rooms

1190
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:40,618
um they want you to just to use their

1191
00:44:38,699 --> 00:44:44,159
their salt Blends and keep everything

1192
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:47,519
sterile and I think that is

1193
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:49,739
completely ignorant to what nature does

1194
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:52,440
and how Nature has evolved over the

1195
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:54,118
years because it's supposed to your

1196
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,818
plants are supposed to have endophytes

1197
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:57,900
and and and

1198
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,920
ecophytic bacteria around the root

1199
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,780
systems it's supposed to have a

1200
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,400
mycorrhizae relationship they're

1201
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:04,500
supposed to be Rock phosphate in the

1202
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,660
soils that the mycorrhizae can latch

1203
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,219
onto and consume and directly inject the

1204
00:45:06,659 --> 00:45:11,420
phosphorus into the root system of the

1205
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:14,459
plant I think there's there's you know

1206
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:17,039
a bottled consortia of these

1207
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:19,380
microorganisms is way better than no

1208
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:20,818
contortion at all got it and kind of

1209
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,400
relating to what you had said you know

1210
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:25,619
the mycorrhizal network down in the

1211
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:28,260
medium companion plant so I want to get

1212
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:30,240
into that because that is said to

1213
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,240
actually have an impact on terpene

1214
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,199
synthesis right so for example

1215
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:35,959
strawberries if you're growing

1216
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:38,939
strawberries next to a medicinal plant

1217
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:41,940
some say that you could potentially get

1218
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:43,619
a terpene profile simulated strawberries

1219
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,358
in that medicinal plant what are your

1220
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:47,280
thoughts on that

1221
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:48,598
um you know I I think there's something

1222
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,400
to say

1223
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:53,880
um for

1224
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:57,000
um root exudates and and different

1225
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:59,780
plants talking to each other and sharing

1226
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,760
uh nutrition and and and

1227
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:05,040
organic molecules I think other plants

1228
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:08,760
will also attract a different consortia

1229
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:11,099
of uh microbiology around the different

1230
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:13,680
rhizospheres of the plant you know

1231
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:15,240
certain certain crops will have a

1232
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:18,118
certain natural

1233
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:21,419
um like beans having a natural Lagoon

1234
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:24,358
um uh loving bacteria is odobacter

1235
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:27,659
bacteria you know they they legumes

1236
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:31,799
promote nitrogen fixation microbes cover

1237
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:34,318
crops you know I think I think it's I

1238
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,000
think plants naturally will want to

1239
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:38,039
interact with each other inside an

1240
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,300
ecosystem so when you start putting

1241
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:40,920
different plants together I think

1242
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,140
naturally they're gonna they're gonna

1243
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:46,680
share and they're gonna be different

1244
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:48,299
than them by themselves absolutely got

1245
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:49,858
it there's a few more things I want to

1246
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:52,440
get into and we could talk about this

1247
00:46:49,858 --> 00:46:54,858
topic for hours if we really wanted to

1248
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,720
but uh dude I know

1249
00:46:54,858 --> 00:46:59,759
ideal storage conditions and order to

1250
00:46:57,719 --> 00:47:02,279
conserve terpenes right so if you're not

1251
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,599
storing it in the proper conditions like

1252
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,280
I kind of mentioned a little bit earlier

1253
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,079
these turkeys can volatile right you can

1254
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,060
lose them and when you go into your grow

1255
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:11,280
room and you're smelling those are

1256
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:12,539
terpenes volatizing so like the storage

1257
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,920
side of things I think is often

1258
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:15,059
overlooked

1259
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,700
um you know there's a lot of focus on

1260
00:47:15,059 --> 00:47:20,400
drying proper drying conditions curing

1261
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:21,719
having the right moisture content but

1262
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,059
storage a lot of people I feel like

1263
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:26,219
neglect unfortunately and they're losing

1264
00:47:24,059 --> 00:47:28,500
a lot of that terpene profile just

1265
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:30,299
volatizing away so what's the ideal

1266
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:34,139
storage condition in order to conserve

1267
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:36,300
terpenes so I struggle and me and the

1268
00:47:34,139 --> 00:47:38,699
rest of the state I mean probably four

1269
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,960
state area on this side of the

1270
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:44,399
um the side of the United States to

1271
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:47,579
Colorado Arizona New Mexico Utah area

1272
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,559
um in Nevada we struggle with having any

1273
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:52,079
humidity here

1274
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:53,940
um it's we're lucky to get 30 humidity

1275
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,880
most days and really good storage

1276
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:59,940
conditions is about 60 percent

1277
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:03,119
um inside your jars and of course the

1278
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:04,740
biggest thing is is

1279
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,559
um the UV radiation

1280
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:09,598
UV is very very very good at breaking

1281
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:13,858
apart molecules

1282
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:15,720
um so usually clear jars stuck out in

1283
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:17,460
the sunlight are going to volatile as

1284
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:19,858
terpenes way faster than anything else

1285
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,300
move faster than heat way faster than

1286
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:25,739
ambient

1287
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:27,480
um arid environments I think a lot of it

1288
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:30,799
what you need to do is keep in a cool

1289
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:33,240
dark place and keep it as

1290
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,339
once you once you cure it or once you

1291
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:37,259
dry it to a certain to a certain extent

1292
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:40,380
making sure that it stays in a sealed

1293
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:43,380
container no plastic plastic leeches so

1294
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:44,818
bad and because plastic is Petro based

1295
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:47,180
molecules it's carbon-based molecules

1296
00:48:44,818 --> 00:48:50,219
all these terpenes are going to

1297
00:48:47,179 --> 00:48:52,318
evaporate and Purge through the the

1298
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:55,318
plastic so plastic is your enemy use

1299
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:57,659
glass I like amber glass personally and

1300
00:48:55,318 --> 00:49:00,659
I like to keep my stuff in in a drawer

1301
00:48:57,659 --> 00:49:02,279
or like a in a tote and just keep them

1302
00:49:00,659 --> 00:49:03,899
in a cool dry spot pretty

1303
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,760
straightforward all right so let's wrap

1304
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,619
things up tell Alice how can the

1305
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,619
listeners find you and what do you have

1306
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:12,660
upcoming in the future oh man uh lots of

1307
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:14,760
good stuff you can find us

1308
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:16,440
um through our Discord uh if you guys

1309
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,300
have a profile you can come out to our

1310
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:21,000
Discord and come chat with us there we

1311
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:23,160
have a lot of really good uh uh

1312
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,199
literature that that's based on that our

1313
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:26,519
products are based on I post all our

1314
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:28,439
literature there we have really good
