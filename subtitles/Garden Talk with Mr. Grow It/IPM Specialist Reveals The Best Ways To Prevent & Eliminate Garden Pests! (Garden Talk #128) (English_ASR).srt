94
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,480
get into this one thanks I really

95
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,518
appreciate it worked hard on that

96
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,438
let's start with IPM I have to warn you

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,080
some of the folks that I have listening

98
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:38,719
this podcast are beginners although we

99
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,200
do have some intermediate and Advance as

100
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:44,199
well so starting with IPM what is IPM

101
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,438
and then also get into the everwarm

102
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,318
concept which is something that I

103
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:49,799
actually learned from you yeah so this

104
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:51,878
everstorm concept is an idea that um

105
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,200
I've kind of come up with although to be

106
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:57,239
honest it's not like super unique it's

107
00:03:54,199 --> 00:04:00,518
just a way of rethinking certain aspects

108
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:03,959
of like ecology and biology and and in

109
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,519
particular through the funnel of how can

110
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,319
we as

111
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:12,079
cultivators most sustainably or most um

112
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:13,598
efficiently tackle the issue of pests

113
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,159
especially as they move between

114
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,759
continents and are always constantly

115
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:22,000
evolving adapting so it's about being

116
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:25,479
able to disrupt the sort of system and

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,160
and preferably ideally using um many

118
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:30,478
different kinds

119
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,840
of Pathways to that objective

120
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,399
um ways that will like so you don't have

121
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,159
chemical resistance for example which

122
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,279
we've seen agriculture that's the common

123
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,000
example but pests can get resistant to

124
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:43,198
things like biocontrols too microbial

125
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,240
biocontrols uh bacteria and fungi and

126
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,800
that kind of thing or even viruses that

127
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:52,240
are used so if we if you understand like

128
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,160
a a greater sort of um ecological Theory

129
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,160
then you can understand why certain

130
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,639
techniques do or don't work um and which

131
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,280
ones are most relevant and what's the

132
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,879
most practical thing a lot of this is

133
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,599
really sort of high high level stuff but

134
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,439
it can be broken down into the

135
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,280
mechanisms of interactions between

136
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:12,519
plants and pests and IPM essentially is

137
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,519
all about doing that kind of thing and

138
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:17,719
uh as a concept obviously a lot of these

139
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:19,159
concepts are sometimes even ancient but

140
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,680
uh generally speaking IPM has been

141
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,520
around since like the 1950s or so and

142
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,400
it's this idea of integrating different

143
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:28,318
management practices for Pest and it's

144
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,399
evolved over time too has a lot to do

145
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,600
with like preventing pest right so a lot

146
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,120
of these things you're actually doing

147
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,319
before pests are visible right before

148
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,038
pests are even there and I have a IPM

149
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,240
routine that I do um you know I can't

150
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:44,000
say that I'm super strict on it but uh

151
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,560
there are some things that I do in my

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,120
garden indoor garden in particular I

153
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,360
mostly grow indoors although I do have a

154
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,879
vegetable garden Outdoors but there are

155
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,439
some things that I do in order to try to

156
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:56,918
prevent pests from invading my grow

157
00:05:54,439 --> 00:06:00,279
space and I'd like to kind of go over

158
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:01,560
some of my IPM methods my my routine

159
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:03,198
really and some of these things that

160
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,038
we're about to go through I don't do on

161
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,439
every grow some I do do on every grow

162
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:08,439
I'd like to kind of get your feedback on

163
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,680
some of these things and kind of get

164
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:12,319
some more details on things so first off

165
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,720
I think pretty straightforward is

166
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,840
scouting plants lot of people say oh

167
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,400
yeah Scout plants look at your plants

168
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:19,839
some people do it every single day some

169
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,959
people like ah you don't need to do that

170
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,560
often every week or so you want to look

171
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:26,519
at plants some people say hey that's not

172
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,839
frequently enough you can certainly get

173
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:31,038
an infestation and have pests take over

174
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:32,679
your grow space in a faster period of

175
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,240
time so you want to have them frequently

176
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,319
now as far as scouting P what's your

177
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,720
opinion on how often to Scout and also

178
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,520
where this go right are we looking at

179
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,599
the soil are we looking at the bottom

180
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,680
part of the plant we looking at the top

181
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:47,719
part of the plant so on and so forth

182
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,360
Yeah so basically I think IPM and and

183
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,160
crop scouting in general whether you're

184
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,199
doing it in like one single tent or a

185
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,240
large field or however your context is

186
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,079
it's always going to be context

187
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,639
dependent where you're at also matters a

188
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,719
lot like you kind of say here like

189
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,519
sometimes you can get away with not

190
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,960
doing it every day some people it's a

191
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,079
little bit different everyone's context

192
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,959
is a little bit different so you have to

193
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:09,719
find the right uh plan for your

194
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,638
particular scenario but yes generally

195
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,400
speaking crop scouting is very important

196
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,199
it's I think the foundation because if

197
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,598
you don't know what's going on in

198
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,960
various ways you won't be able to make

199
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:22,038
an informed decision and a lot of these

200
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:25,560
pests can be uh pretty difficult to see

201
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:27,120
or are invisible to see when they start

202
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,079
like the germination of powdery mil on

203
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,120
leaves for example it's like you know

204
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:34,120
100 plus hours before you're going to

205
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,199
even possibly see like the mildew grow

206
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,680
or something like this and when you're

207
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,919
looking you want to look at various

208
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,160
parts of the plant not just the foliage

209
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:43,478
you know if it's a flower look at the

210
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,960
flower look at the leaves look at the

211
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:47,519
stems as well look Underside leaves a

212
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:50,799
lot of times insects and mites will like

213
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,719
be on underside leaves um you know look

214
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,319
also at the roots if you can sometimes

215
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,159
you can sometimes it's harder to do that

216
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,520
depending on your context but look at

217
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:01,639
every aspect of the plant and also um

218
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,560
you know if you can incorporate other

219
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,439
kinds of sensors besides the Mark 1

220
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,759
eyeball you know there's other things

221
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,598
out there that people use to um give

222
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,560
them a better idea about what's going on

223
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:13,878
in their local environment I think one

224
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,360
of the most common things is using one

225
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:18,319
of those handheld microscopes I think

226
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,280
they're like a 10x or 30X microscope in

227
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,720
order to kind of see things that's what

228
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,758
I use I know that yeah you mentioned

229
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,080
can't really see everything with the

230
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,280
naked eye right so it's like having a

231
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:31,519
hand scope in there can be beneficial to

232
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:33,559
see some of those microscopic pests yeah

233
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,038
definitely now yellow stickies that's

234
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:37,079
another thing I want to talk about

235
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,038
that's something I use really not as

236
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,440
something to eliminate pests but to

237
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,319
identify that the pests are there so I

238
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,200
personally have yellow sticky traps kind

239
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,560
just stuck into the soil you usually

240
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,519
have one in each pot some people may say

241
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:51,479
that's an Overkill others say no that's

242
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,000
perfectly fine I know some people use

243
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,759
the yellow stickies and they put them by

244
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,120
the soil some have one hanging up in the

245
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:00,639
air what's your take on yellow stickies

246
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,078
and how to use them proper L well I like

247
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,240
what you said at the beginning that a

248
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:07,199
lot of people do there are there are

249
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,399
like glue traps so to speak that you can

250
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,440
use that might be more about like

251
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,200
killing a large amount if you get like a

252
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,720
bunch of flies or other kinds of flying

253
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,560
bugs around like thrips but generally

254
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,920
speaking Yeah yellow yellow glue traps

255
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:22,879
are not for uh disposing of the pest

256
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:26,958
really is about sampling them and I

257
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:28,639
would say that if you're in a small tent

258
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,679
a lot of times in commercial settings

259
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:34,199
like a standard sized card uh might be

260
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,799
used like per Greenhouse or or for like

261
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,560
a larger section than you might normally

262
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:41,359
typically see in a smaller tent so maybe

263
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,159
one is good enough um putting one in

264
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,720
every single one though like I think

265
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:46,919
that's just a matter of like how many

266
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,079
are you getting in a pack and and how

267
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:52,759
much how long how often are you um

268
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:54,599
replacing them uh typically I advise

269
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:57,039
people to replace like in a commercial

270
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,440
setting every week if you have the the

271
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,439
labor and the capabilities to do that um

272
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,160
I think from a homeg grow perspective

273
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,480
that's also true as well no matter what

274
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:09,278
plant you're growing um because if you

275
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,440
have if you take it off every week you

276
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:13,120
put a new one in and then you look at

277
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,680
what was in the old one and you take

278
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,639
note you might see things like

279
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:19,239
parasitoid wasps you might think see

280
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,679
things like uh flies or even like a

281
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,159
house fly or something that you know is

282
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:23,838
not a pest but it was around in your

283
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,278
house or something and being able to

284
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,959
discern the difference between different

285
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,000
things is very crucial for making it uh

286
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:32,639
you know most maximal in the way that

287
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,559
you deploy it really good points there

288
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,278
now another thing that I like to do is

289
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:39,879
avoid going directly from my outdoor

290
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,320
Garden immediately to my indoor garden

291
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:43,958
and I know some people say that's an

292
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,399
Overkill but others swear that you can

293
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:47,838
certainly bring in pests from the

294
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,958
outside and your indoor garden so I'm

295
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,639
often taking off my clothes changing my

296
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:54,799
clothes between my outdoor and indoor

297
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,759
garden would you say that's a good

298
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,078
practice to do or is that kind of an

299
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:01,240
Overkill can't say it's a bad practice

300
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:03,638
um I think that's totally valid

301
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,680
especially because like in different

302
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:08,278
seasons you know like in winter time

303
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,278
maybe you might feel a little bit safer

304
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:11,240
you know because there might be less

305
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,480
things out and about whereas like during

306
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,320
spring and summertime you know I I will

307
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,159
be walking in I'll be like hiking and

308
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,160
I'll see like an apit or something you

309
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:21,039
know blow onto like my shirt or a jacket

310
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:23,679
or somebody else's shirt or their hair

311
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:26,879
or something like it does happen uh you

312
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,838
might not realize it but it does and um

313
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,759
I would also say that like in a similar

314
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:32,680
vein if you get like fresh produce you

315
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:34,879
should check that too I live in

316
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:36,719
California so I know that there are

317
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,600
different pests that can get into

318
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,399
produce like thrips in berries like

319
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,159
raspberries and blackberries I

320
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,559
definitely see that all the time and so

321
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,078
people are wondering they might even

322
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:47,599
treat a thrips problem everything's fine

323
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,838
then they come back again like how did

324
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,680
this happen that's by um that's your

325
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,519
biocurity procedure uh taking effect and

326
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,278
so I think that changing your clothing

327
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,839
before entering your grow space is

328
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:02,000
certainly valid I didn't even think of

329
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,560
bringing it in on your produce that's

330
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,078
yeah that's interesting next up on the

331
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:08,000
list I have dious Earth so this is

332
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,399
something that's commonly used I know we

333
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
kind of talked about this a little bit

334
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:12,399
we touched upon in our last episode but

335
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,720
I want to bring it back up because

336
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,078
something I've done in the past I don't

337
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,120
do it every grow but I've done in the

338
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:19,479
past where I sprinkle some Diet tomati

339
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,159
Earth on the top of the medium and from

340
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,480
what you hear through the gra Vine is

341
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:26,198
that it really helps prevent things like

342
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,360
fungus Nets helps uh they apparently

343
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:30,559
it's like glass shards to them and it's

344
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,519
really hard for them to kind of be on

345
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:35,159
top of the medium I'm not sure if it

346
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,278
destroys their exoskeleton or what but I

347
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,639
know in our past episode you had

348
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:41,360
mentioned that you had some concerns

349
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,360
about the effectiveness of dious Earth

350
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,159
using it what are your thoughts on dious

351
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,759
Earth is it still kind of something

352
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:49,600
where the effectiveness is questionable

353
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,679
or uh is this something that's kind of

354
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,839
proven to be helpful in preventing pests

355
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:57,039
yeah I mean di Earth has its place for

356
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,880
sure um but I feel like when you apply

357
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,480
it on soil when it gets moist it's not

358
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:04,078
effective anymore so since substrates

359
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,039
are usually getting irrigated um that

360
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,559
kind of hampers its Effectiveness in

361
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:10,519
that way uh but but you know despite

362
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,479
saying that and despite also mentioning

363
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,198
that I've um read a bunch of research

364
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,360
about using them especially for fungus

365
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:17,719
STS in particular apparently it was not

366
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,759
found to be very

367
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,199
efficacious but people report it being

368
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,720
uh effective for them so I wonder if

369
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:26,399
there's something going on with certain

370
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,680
pests I mean when people say pests

371
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,519
that's kind of broad uh but you know

372
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,879
specific kinds of pest might be totally

373
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,639
unaffected whereas others might be also

374
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,919
how are you evaluating that I think is

375
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,759
very important if people just apply it

376
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:40,278
and they just don't get any pests

377
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:42,078
because they just weren't there you

378
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:44,399
can't really attribute that to having

379
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:46,638
like a resistance effect if that makes

380
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,240
sense so I think also people should pay

381
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,399
attention to how they're evaluating

382
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,120
different products um in the first place

383
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:56,440
where I would use it um would be like a

384
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,639
on a hard surface that's not typically

385
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,240
getting moist or hydrated and then using

386
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,039
that as like a physical barrier cuz

387
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,680
you're right what happens is that the

388
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:08,159
the datom that are harvested in the

389
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,719
ocean they have these silicate bodies

390
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:13,319
and they crush them up into like

391
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:16,040
basically glass and then the insect

392
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,920
cuticle which is like a armored you know

393
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:20,559
body there's little joints and those

394
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:22,360
shards can get into them and they can

395
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,198
cause a problem and so it's like getting

396
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,600
all cut up by glass shards while you're

397
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:29,319
in a suit of armor it's not a pleasant

398
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,000
situation to be in super interesting

399
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,360
it's so you said hard surface can you

400
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,480
give kind of examples on what you mean

401
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,639
yeah like a floor perhaps like maybe

402
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,399
like outside the yeah like at the

403
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:42,360
threshold between like a door of like

404
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,879
two rooms or something if um if it's

405
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,519
typically not getting like really maybe

406
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:47,320
on the outside potentially like that's

407
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,278
how people use for like home pests like

408
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,600
ants and and that kind of thing okay got

409
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:55,439
it let's talk about sprays next a lot of

410
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,639
people will use sprays as a preventative

411
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,560
uh I used to rotate my sprays I used to

412
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,240
do like neoil one week and then next

413
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:04,000
week do peppermint spray the next week

414
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:07,198
do a rosemary spray I've used products

415
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,519
like Mammoth can control which is uh for

416
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:12,399
my understanding I think it's thyme oil

417
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,320
and a corn oil if I remember correctly

418
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,879
and then there's also the amazing Dr zes

419
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,600
which is a product I've used been very

420
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:18,958
very helpful for not just pest

421
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,120
prevention but also like eliminating

422
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,599
pest as well can you give us your

423
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,519
overall thoughts on those type of

424
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,600
products I mentioned and kind of the

425
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,799
rotating maybe some best practices on

426
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,440
rotating them yeah well I would say that

427
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:35,240
like um I think that your context really

428
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:39,399
dictates whether I would personally use

429
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:41,240
it or not for example if you have um a

430
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,000
situation where you typically get a lot

431
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,278
of pests like kind of constantly like a

432
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,919
low pressure but still present like

433
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,360
thrips are really famous for this kind

434
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,039
of thing they'll get in they won't maybe

435
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,759
you can keep the population from getting

436
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,958
high but you're constantly having them

437
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,159
and if you know that they're coming

438
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:58,399
around like late spring and summer then

439
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,240
maybe you start applying this um

440
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,799
previous L before you have a problem and

441
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,600
then you don't have like this population

442
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:08,919
increase um so you could go at like a

443
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,159
weekly rate or a bi-weekly rate of some

444
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:13,399
sort of like a like a pyin product for

445
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:15,000
example or maybe asid duratin or

446
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:17,720
something like in veg but you have to be

447
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,879
careful and I'm very hesitant about

448
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,519
using things in flour not necessarily

449
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:23,639
because because a product might be

450
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,879
non-toxic or might volatize quickly or

451
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:29,440
something like this where you don't have

452
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:31,759
residual however you might still like

453
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,759
disrupt the tricomes or other sorts of

454
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,318
things that might be a quality control

455
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,399
issue so in some cases it might matter

456
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:42,318
in some cases I would not necessarily um

457
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,839
go that route okay and rotating the the

458
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:46,439
sprays on like a weekly basis for

459
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,199
example is that effective would you say

460
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,560
because uh I think you touched upon this

461
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:51,479
in the beginning of the episode where

462
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:52,879
it's like pest can kind of get used to

463
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,920
it right so if you're spraying neem

464
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,159
every single week they can get used to

465
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:58,919
it and then it's not really doing

466
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,719
anything to them so rotating around

467
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,838
peppermint is a common one that you hear

468
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,439
about using Rosemary those three in

469
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,679
particular I used to rotate around every

470
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,600
week would you say that could be

471
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:10,120
effective for the average homeg grower

472
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,759
is there a different spray that you

473
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:14,159
would add in or or replace yeah well I

474
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:16,038
think that so like the products that

475
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,519
you're talking about they they work kind

476
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:19,318
of broadly against a lot of different

477
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,240
like insect and my pest so if those are

478
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:22,879
the things you're concerned with then

479
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,880
yeah that could be helpful although I

480
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,880
would say that typically I think from

481
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,280
that ever sworm concept we talked about

482
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,400
if you want to disrupt a system you want

483
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:34,678
to have redundancy that can mean greater

484
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,440
cost sometimes because you have

485
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,919
different products being applied that

486
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,960
kind of do similar things or do them in

487
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,960
a different way and that might seem too

488
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,519
redundant but actually it's helpful for

489
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,960
resistance management um also when

490
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,200
you're applying these products like you

491
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,759
don't know what pest you're going to

492
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,679
encounter so an insecticidal agent is

493
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,599
not going to affect like a fungus for

494
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,200
example so again when you're rotating a

495
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:01,199
lot of that's I think going to be based

496
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:04,038
on what when you normally encounter

497
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,000
these pests so like maybe in Autumn and

498
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:08,798
and winter perhaps you get more fungal

499
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,400
uh problems maybe it rains a lot more

500
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,200
where you're at and so you might start

501
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,960
applying like a potassium bicarbonate

502
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,080
product which is going to have like a pH

503
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,360
effect on the

504
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:20,359
foliage it has negative effects against

505
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:22,639
like pwy mill do but you might follow

506
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:25,319
that up with like an oil product or

507
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,919
something that also harms the spores and

508
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:29,439
also kills the fungi in a different way

509
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,400
just as an example

510
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,720
understood the last one I want to talk

511
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,360
about here on my IPM routine things that

512
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,240
I've used in the past for IPM maybe not

513
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,759
every grow and actually I've used this

514
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,839
particular product as well in order to

515
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:44,839
battle fungus knats which is mosquito

516
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,439
bits now I know it's there mosquito bits

517
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:48,359
is mosquito dunks is a couple different

518
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,558
products but it's all essentially the

519
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:52,439
same thing which is a type of bacteria

520
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:56,639
right

521
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:59,120
BT can you talk to us about BT you know

522
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,240
what is it what it actually does in

523
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:05,519
regards to pest elimination and or pest

524
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:10,400
prevention yes so BT stands for basilis

525
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:12,038
th ganis and it is a species of bacteria

526
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,159
with various strains now you have

527
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:15,679
different ones out there that are

528
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:18,799
available so some like israelensis are

529
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:22,480
used against flies and fly larv

530
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:24,519
especially um kraki and isawi for

531
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,319
example are used against caterpillars

532
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:28,558
typically and if you use the wrong

533
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,918
strain it will usually not have very

534
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:34,558
much much an effect at all against the

535
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:36,200
the misapplied Target and how these work

536
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,639
is essentially that these different

537
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,319
strains they produce various proteins

538
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,720
like cry proteins for example for

539
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:46,879
caterpillars and those they all are

540
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,759
toxic for the caterpillar or the fly

541
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,440
larvae it gets into their gut it um

542
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:54,079
gives them sepsis and they die very

543
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,480
quickly so it's not a great way to go

544
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,879
out um people are sometimes concerned

545
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,519
because they think that maybe the BT

546
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,200
would be uh harmful for themselves uh

547
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:05,918
but it's actually very very narrow um in

548
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,200
what they affect it can't affect us and

549
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:12,200
also they require a alkaline gut which

550
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,960
caterpillars for example have um to

551
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,798
damage them so we don't have that kind

552
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,200
of gut anyways so that's how it works

553
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,798
and it was pretty effective in my

554
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,440
opinion it's one of the better things to

555
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:26,038
use against things like Bud worm Mo for

556
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:28,080
example the only thing is that the

557
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:30,359
organism has to come into contact with

558
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,439
enough of the of the propag goals that

559
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:34,678
you're applying and usually that does

560
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,880
require them to be feeding at that time

561
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,240
so you're in this situation where you

562
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,200
have to apply it and you have to apply

563
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,960
it early and you have to apply it before

564
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,319
the first sign of like budw worms for

565
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,558
example or fungus at larby or something

566
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:50,918
like that to have the the best effect

567
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:53,678
now can you overdo it with BT right so

568
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:55,960
like adding it to the soil we hear about

569
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,400
having a balanced soil food web right

570
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,600
and if you're continuing to add this in

571
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,759
over and over and over again this

572
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:03,439
particular species well can this

573
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:05,079
Dominate and kind of throw things off in

574
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,320
regards to the balance of the soil food

575
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:09,240
web that's a good question and although

576
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:12,359
other microbes maybe this would be more

577
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,599
true for um BT I don't think so much

578
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:17,839
because it's kind of an obligate or

579
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:21,158
maybe a facultative uh or faculative uh

580
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:24,599
uh parasite so other bacteria and fungi

581
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:27,960
in the in the uh phylane and the ropl

582
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:30,558
the foliage surface and the root surface

583
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,480
um I think probably want maybe a a

584
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:35,759
different kind of bacteria or fungus um

585
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,159
or youd consider something different uh

586
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:40,480
that would have that kind of disruptive

587
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:42,640
effect potentially okay next up I have a

588
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,759
viewer question so this is actually a

589
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,080
viewer from our last episode he

590
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:49,558
commented and he wanted to get your

591
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:52,119
thoughts on a few things so the question

592
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:54,798
is how do you feel about pyin and

593
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:56,879
spinosad or IPM both are entirely

594
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,839
organic and are approved for use on

595
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,360
medicinal plants and they both some of

596
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:03,839
the well tested products for IPM also

597
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:07,240
what are your thoughts on bener I'm

598
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:11,199
going to butcher this one benia basana a

599
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:13,960
fungus attack pests so I think Pine and

600
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,480
and spinosin which make up spinosad

601
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,360
those are pretty effective they are also

602
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,919
I would I would cause I would call Pre

603
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:22,359
pretty safe I feel like um compared to

604
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:23,799
other products like people learn about

605
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:26,119
like systemic compounds and things you

606
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:28,599
shouldn't be using in medicinal plants

607
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:29,759
and potentially other plants too because

608
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:32,678
they get into like the

609
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,480
nectaries um like NE nanoids do this

610
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:36,519
sometimes or a lot of the time and then

611
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,240
insects like honeybees come in or or

612
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:40,038
native pollinators they come in they

613
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,200
feed on it and they die and that's not

614
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:44,038
great so you know really consider those

615
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,919
sorts of products when you're applying

616
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:50,038
them uh but I do like to use pyrine

617
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:52,000
because pyin um they volatize really

618
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:54,119
quickly and they decay in the presence

619
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,919
of water and sunlight which you get a

620
00:22:54,119 --> 00:23:00,038
lot in various kinds of situations right

621
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:03,278
so pyin doesn't stay as a res residual

622
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:05,919
which is nice and as far as um sort of

623
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:08,038
other products I do like buia bastiana I

624
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,799
like to use it quite a bit you can not

625
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:11,440
really overdo it for the most part it's

626
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:12,759
typically kind of expensive though so

627
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,000
you're probably not going to be doing

628
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:18,000
that um but it's a broadspectrum

629
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,440
entomopathogenic fungus which basically

630
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,278
means that it's a fungus that can feed

631
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:26,080
on various kinds of mainly insects like

632
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:28,558
thrips even aphids I like to use a lot

633
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:30,439
against rude aphids for example so yeah

634
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,240
I have a lot of applications for boaria

635
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,480
and there's different strains of boaria

636
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,079
too and also aera fumosa Oria is another

637
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:41,120
fungus that you can maybe use in Li of

638
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:44,038
bouvia if you can't get boaria awesome

639
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:46,158
now are there any sprays whether it be

640
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:48,558
those or any other sprays out there that

641
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:51,679
are safe to use in the flowering stage

642
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:53,158
you know I'm not somebody who can uh say

643
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,600
that like some of these products have

644
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:55,919
been tested because unfortunately

645
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,038
there's not a lot of the research that I

646
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,919
would normally rely on uh if I want to

647
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:02,879
be into ually honest but I think that

648
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:05,240
for example like the BT I mentioned

649
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,080
earlier I feel pretty comfortable with

650
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:11,079
that um in some cases the pyin feels

651
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:13,480
pretty comfortable although I'm very

652
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:16,158
hesitant to use it past like the very

653
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:19,240
beginning of flower um just primarily

654
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,840
because I don't like how um for one

655
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,278
thing when you get these products the

656
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:27,038
pyrine product itself might be fine and

657
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:29,200
it might volatize very quickly but you

658
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:32,278
don't know what other products are being

659
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,679
used like inertly in uh products that

660
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:37,480
you buy right so like if you could just

661
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,840
snap your fingers and just apply pyrin

662
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,480
that's one thing when you buy a

663
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:42,599
commercial product like one time I had

664
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,960
an example where I was working with a

665
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:47,158
client they had been buying a pyin

666
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,038
product it was fine no problem then one

667
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:51,880
day they get um one that has an enhancer

668
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:53,640
called pipol butoxide which are not

669
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,919
supposed to use or you weren't supposed

670
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,919
to use at the time and they had no they

671
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:01,120
didn't know how this happened

672
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,000
uh they tested it they we talked to the

673
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,599
the supplier they don't know how it

674
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,558
happened so it just has given me pause

675
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,599
ever since experiences like this you

676
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:12,119
know so like don't just think that uh

677
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:13,759
just because the label says one thing

678
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:15,719
you know sometimes there's weird batches

679
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:18,679
and things like that to consider that

680
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,200
makes sense what about jadam wedding

681
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,960
agent I've heard a lot of people using

682
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,319
that as like a preventative and somebody

683
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,360
actually mentioned that was safe to

684
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:27,960
spray and flour would you agree with

685
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:30,038
that disagree with that or what do your

686
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,079
overall thoughts yeah I don't have a lot

687
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:34,798
of experience with jadam but um I do uh

688
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:37,599
talk to a lot of people who do use it a

689
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:40,839
lot so uh personally I don't have a very

690
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:42,639
informed opinion on it to be honest um

691
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,319
as far as using it like in veg and

692
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,799
something like that I'm not really

693
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:49,119
against it necessarily but in flower I'm

694
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:51,278
not sure as well okay so that's pretty

695
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,959
much all that I've done in the past is

696
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:56,440
regard as preventative for IPM now are

697
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,880
there any other IPM methods that I

698
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,919
should consider adding to my rtin

699
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,600
well you you've got good crop scouting

700
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:06,640
so you might for example entertain the

701
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:11,678
use of how big is your area uh I'm

702
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:13,919
working in a 13x13 realm okay so um I

703
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,200
would say that you could consider maybe

704
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,960
if you want to splurge like there's

705
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,960
different echelons to this if you want

706
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,960
to splurge you might be able to get some

707
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,720
of these uh High flutin cameras that

708
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,360
they got out there that are like AI I

709
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,278
see people using those um uh there's a

710
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:33,959
product I saw recently where um it it

711
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:36,079
flies around on like a um cables uh like

712
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,159
like a thre like really thin cables and

713
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:42,879
it takes pictures of your of your

714
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:46,240
canopy and it uses AI to kind of look at

715
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,080
uh the different Spectra of the foliage

716
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,038
and check for different changes and

717
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:51,519
growth and that kind of a thing but uh

718
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:53,359
that's really mostly speculative that's

719
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,158
one thing you could do on one extreme

720
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:57,719
angle uh maybe if you have more plants

721
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,000
the other thing that you could do though

722
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,679
is you could consider adding um a plan

723
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,240
of various pests that you normally

724
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:07,960
encounter and even just tracking when uh

725
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,919
you encounter them during the year and

726
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,440
once you've got sort of a

727
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,559
regularity you then might look and see

728
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,640
if you have products that you could add

729
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:20,119
like an additional Mo of action to or

730
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,960
maybe attack a certain life stage so for

731
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:24,158
example ideally if you've got like a

732
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,759
fungus net there's an egg a larvae and

733
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,760
adult stage and in a pupil stage too if

734
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:31,640
you can attack every single life stage

735
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,038
and ideally with multiple modes of

736
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:37,080
action that's like the ideal and so if

737
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:39,000
you almost always get only fungus Nets

738
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:42,599
maybe you would spend a little bit of

739
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,839
extra um resources to uh increase that

740
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:47,480
robustness potentially or you might

741
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:49,278
realize that that's very expensive and

742
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,200
what you're doing now works fine and

743
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:53,319
it's very efficient and economical so

744
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,159
it's all context dependent I appreciate

745
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:56,319
the advice one other thing that comes to

746
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:57,519
mind that people are starting to use

747
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:01,879
these days and I want to get your input

748
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:03,319
on is UV light I think it's UVC light in

749
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,200
particular is what they're using to

750
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:09,480
shine onto both the soil as well as the

751
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,278
undersides of the leaves what's your

752
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,480
take on that is that an effective

753
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,880
solution for pest prevention or

754
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,399
elimination absolutely it's been used

755
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,480
for a long time um so UV light being

756
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:24,398
used as like a pesticidal also like for

757
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:27,120
insects for mites for fungi um it's been

758
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:28,959
around for a long time uh I used to know

759
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:30,558
some Dutch Growers use it in glass

760
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,558
houses on like a boom like you would use

761
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,200
like a boom sprayer in a large

762
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:38,119
greenhouse and they would just attach

763
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:40,440
lights to it um dosage is very important

764
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:42,239
because and also being very safe with

765
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,960
its uh use because you don't want those

766
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,278
lights to so UVB and UVC are detrimental

767
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,240
to your skin detrimental to your eyes

768
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:53,319
you don't want to hurt yourself uh there

769
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,599
was a famous um uh party that happened

770
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:57,398
recently for some like nft like monkey

771
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,439
coins or whatever those things are and

772
00:28:57,398 --> 00:29:01,119
they put UV lights that were harmful to

773
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,840
your eyes people went to the club and

774
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,359
they reported having like partial

775
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:07,079
blindness and things like this so you

776
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:08,558
got to be careful you know if you go to

777
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,879
a party you see UV lights there you

778
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:12,639
don't know what they used anyways my

779
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,480
point is that you should be concerned

780
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,480
about um the safety but if you use it

781
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,120
responsibly it's highly effective and

782
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,200
you don't even have to dose for very

783
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:25,038
long so it basically works because the

784
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,120
UV light gets through the cuticle of the

785
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,759
insects or the fungi and it basically

786
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,918
disrupts their DNA

787
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:32,759
and they die pretty quickly so that's

788
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:34,919
why it's really highly effective and I

789
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,798
think if uh more people were to

790
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:40,799
implement them it's important to know

791
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:42,599
your setup and also to know um the best

792
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:44,960
way of applying it because in my opinion

793
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:47,959
the best way to do that is at a level a

794
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,159
stable range where you know how far the

795
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,480
light is from the canopy and you also

796
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,039
know uh and you can be consistent in

797
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,960
your dosage of how long the lights are

798
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:58,879
on for which shouldn't be too long

799
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,000
typically yeah I've heard of as low as 5

800
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,360
minutes a day some people say 10 minutes

801
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,839
a day is that reasonable I think that's

802
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:08,199
even sort of um sort of long in some

803
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,959
cases it depends on the frequency though

804
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,480
um of the of the ultraviolet radiation I

805
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,200
think it also depends maybe even like if

806
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,880
you're doing it if you're just having

807
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,558
them on or if you're like moving them

808
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,080
around um to get like an even spread or

809
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:24,240
something like that but uh for example I

810
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,519
know ex I know situations where people

811
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,240
in research have used against pmu

812
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:32,200
petritis and they only need to apply for

813
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,038
a few minutes I know UVC light I believe

814
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,278
also comes in some air purification

815
00:30:34,038 --> 00:30:39,278
systems so I have one of the systems

816
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:42,119
where it uses UV light as well to help

817
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:44,359
destroy I don't know if it's the viruses

818
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:45,959
get caught in the air filter or what but

819
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:48,000
I thought that was pretty interesting

820
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,798
yeah it's a great way to use UV too uh

821
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,278
for air filtration that's part of that

822
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:54,720
biocurity

823
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:56,240
where um having like filters and just

824
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,759
understanding like where these organisms

825
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,759
are coming from because people will ask

826
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:02,200
me they're like my plan works really

827
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,398
well usually but I keep getting these

828
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,159
problems that keep coming in and for

829
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,000
people who are experienced and kind of

830
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,519
know what they're doing already usually

831
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
it's some sort of breakdown in your

832
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,960
information pipeline um you know

833
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,558
something that you thought was a true is

834
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,880
a false basically like maybe you thought

835
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:19,839
that you were secure but oh there's a

836
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,960
hole in your Greenhouse or maybe you

837
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:22,879
thought everything was fine but your

838
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,480
vents you know your filter isn't working

839
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,480
or you don't have a filter you forgot to

840
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,880
replace it like something is there's a

841
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,798
breakdown in the reality that you

842
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,600
thought you were existing in basically

843
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:35,879
so you have to go put on your Sherlock

844
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:38,678
Holmes cap and check around moving on

845
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,360
from IPM let's get into some other

846
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:43,080
things uh I know you wanted to talk

847
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:45,278
about mites insects maybe we can get

848
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:48,480
into fungi bacteria viruses let's start

849
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:50,079
with mites talk to us about mites and

850
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,480
solutions to eliminate them really just

851
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:53,960
kind of giving you the microphone here

852
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,360
and drop some knowledge bombs on us for

853
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,440
sure so I think the big one that most

854
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:00,240
people are dealing with like with the

855
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,038
not just medicinal plants but in general

856
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:07,079
are like two spot spidermite um I talked

857
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:10,398
about it extensively they feed on like

858
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:12,319
4,000 plus plants spidermites are really

859
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:14,278
good at adapting to different plants and

860
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:16,359
they can even have populations become

861
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:18,720
very specific on different species in as

862
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:20,558
much as a few Generations where they've

863
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,399
uh where they adapt their genes very

864
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:26,240
very quickly to the hostplant um so

865
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,479
spider mites are very common but there's

866
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,558
also a lot of solutions for them I like

867
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,440
to use things like wettable sulfur for

868
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,079
example that can be very helpful unless

869
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,278
it's harsh for a particular plant that

870
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,398
you're applying to so always be careful

871
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:41,159
always apply a little bit to see uh if

872
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,239
the plant has a a phytotoxic response or

873
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,480
something like this that's always

874
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,038
helpful for other products that are new

875
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,519
that you haven't applied before you can

876
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:51,558
also use bio controls I'm a huge fan of

877
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,759
using things like pimus MIT or

878
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:55,759
californicus mites or things like that I

879
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,519
also like to use them preventatively I

880
00:32:55,759 --> 00:33:00,919
think that's their most efficient use

881
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:03,359
case although it does require the um you

882
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:05,799
know the uh best practices and uh the

883
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:07,319
use cases knowing your quality control

884
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:09,079
knowing you're sourcing are you getting

885
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:12,439
them from a tertiary distributor or a

886
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:13,960
primary producer um how many are you

887
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,480
applying are you applying too many for

888
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:19,480
your location and maybe you're in a a

889
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,240
smaller area and maybe even the smallest

890
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,079
increment of the bio control you can get

891
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,759
is kind of Overkill already so you'll

892
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:27,798
have to make those choices yourself this

893
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:30,558
will be true for most bio controls um

894
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:33,359
rites are also a big deal uh obviously

895
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:36,200
in medicinal plants but um also in a lot

896
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:39,038
of other plants too I dealt with rose

897
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,919
Rite in uh like eight years ago with

898
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:45,000
Gerber daisies and roses and things and

899
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,799
that cost a lot of uh money and it also

900
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,359
costs a supplier like a million dollars

901
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:52,278
to like retrofit everything because it

902
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:53,638
it transfers a virus so the rites that

903
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:55,839
other people are dealing with in other

904
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:58,719
plants this is not necessarily the case

905
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,359
but in the Rose Rite that was the case

906
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,519
and anyways the way that you deal with

907
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:05,798
them is um you got to be very preventive

908
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,880
usually they're very small their damage

909
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:09,838
is very overt though so if you see

910
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,079
gnarling and curling then you know

911
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:14,039
you're looking at something that might

912
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:17,039
be a Rite other damage can look like

913
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:19,159
rites but um if you see this like sort

914
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,239
of crinkling damage that's typically a

915
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:24,320
Telltale sign broad mites are like that

916
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:26,199
too uh but if you are dealing with rites

917
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,720
one thing to note that I think a lot of

918
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:30,918
people don't realize is that rites are

919
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,279
very specialized so most of the time

920
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:34,918
you're only dealing with a specific

921
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,359
species so for example if you're if

922
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:38,358
you're growing coconuts so you're

923
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:40,319
growing a medicinal plant and you've got

924
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:43,398
tomatoes and you know there's a tomato

925
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,800
reite uh the Tomato reite probably won't

926
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:47,598
be able to feed on uh your other plants

927
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,639
if that makes sense so that's something

928
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,919
that I see people getting um confused

929
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,960
about online a lot and I have a video on

930
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:57,319
my YouTube channel that basically talks

931
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,519
about all kinds of rites where they come

932
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,640
from evolutionarily how did they adapt

933
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:03,519
the way they did and what you can do to

934
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:04,920
defeat defeat them same with spider

935
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:07,159
mites and a lot of these other pests as

936
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,760
well I have been fortunate enough not to

937
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:12,000
come across spidermites or russed mites

938
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,760
so fingers crossed that that never

939
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,960
happens I'm going to knock on wood right

940
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,480
here and hope that it it never happens

941
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,920
there because I heard that both of those

942
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:23,679
are very tough to combat particularly

943
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:26,599
the russed MIT are said to be more tough

944
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:28,598
to combat than the spiderm but spiderm

945
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:30,680
can be very difficult to combat that uh

946
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:33,119
from what I hear particularly when

947
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:34,480
you're in flowering cuz it's harder to

948
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,559
kind of you know you don't have the

949
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,838
sprays to really fall back on and uh

950
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:41,559
once they get out of control and start

951
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:42,880
webbing it's just game over from there

952
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:44,799
yeah they're really difficult I feel

953
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,760
like uh they represent two ends of a

954
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,640
spectrum of what kind of pests you can

955
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,680
deal with on the one hand you've got

956
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:53,559
spider mites super common in my opinion

957
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:55,318
less difficult to deal with although if

958
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:57,880
you let them get out of control they all

959
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:59,639
become very hard to diff uh to deal with

960
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,079
on the other hand you've got rites which

961
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:03,679
I feel like are a little bit less common

962
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,119
for people maybe it depends on where

963
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:08,000
you're at and but they're much more

964
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:09,920
extreme in their damage when you get

965
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,559
them and the Damage they cause is

966
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,519
typically like permanent afterwards you

967
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:17,480
get stunting you get the other problems

968
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:19,759
so uh you have different maybe threat

969
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:22,880
levels for different pests I want to get

970
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,680
into insects next but first I'd like if

971
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,079
you could explain the difference between

972
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:30,159
mites and insects yeah sure so

973
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,920
they last they last share a common

974
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,480
ancestor like over 500 million years ago

975
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,318
even though they look kind of similar

976
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,358
they're actually very different so mites

977
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:41,480
are like uh arachnids you see so like

978
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:43,960
spiders and their relatives in that

979
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,358
group they've got eight legs they

980
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,318
typically have eight legs but like rest

981
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,759
of mites only have four because they're

982
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:51,079
well they've lost a lot of genes over

983
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,760
time let's put it that way you can watch

984
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:55,200
the video if you'd like to learn more

985
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,040
but um mites

986
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:01,759
have they have an extensive

987
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:03,679
um you know various uh various

988
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,920
ecological regions they've gone into

989
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,679
they basically are in all kinds of

990
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,079
niches and the ones we're dealing with

991
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:11,000
are mostly

992
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,680
herbivorous most mice like spider mice

993
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,159
broad mice and romice are what you're

994
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:17,639
going to be dealing with with medicinal

995
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:19,639
plants generally and um the damage that

996
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:23,239
they cause is usually through feeding on

997
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:25,159
plant cells uh and usually they can be

998
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:27,639
kind of innocuous some mites are even

999
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:29,920
beneficial like in the soil whereas

1000
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:31,759
insects for example they are kind of

1001
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,440
they're a smaller group for one a

1002
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,960
taxonomic range

1003
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:40,079
smaller uh but there's actually maybe

1004
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,159
even more parasitic wasps and beetles

1005
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,119
than there are like basically any other

1006
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:47,598
organism on Earth so insects are

1007
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:49,599
incredibly adaptive um highly adaptable

1008
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,000
they basically are shrimp that learned

1009
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:55,079
how to live in not the ocean but the air

1010
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,838
uh by by evolving Wings they're the

1011
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,720
first animals on Earth to have wing

1012
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:02,119
flight so powered flight by the by their

1013
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:04,799
own wings and not by gliding and things

1014
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:06,760
like that and there's all kinds of

1015
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,480
insects the ones that you have to deal

1016
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:12,200
with typically are things like thrips

1017
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,039
and the hemeras or like aphids and other

1018
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:17,519
insects with like a piercing mouth part

1019
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:19,279
um you've got uh you've got insects that

1020
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:20,920
have chewing mouth Parts too like for

1021
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,040
example caterpillars which eventually

1022
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,440
become moths and butterflies which all

1023
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:27,559
butterflies are moths uh I could go on

1024
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,480
and on but um the the four biggest

1025
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:32,440
groups of insects that people deal with

1026
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:38,000
are or that there are actually on Earth

1027
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:40,119
are flies moths beetles and the hota

1028
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,480
which are wasp bees and and ants so

1029
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:45,480
they're all related and I bring these up

1030
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,838
because they're the the four biggest

1031
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,318
groups they're called the big four um

1032
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:53,599
and so you'll also notice that all of

1033
00:38:50,318 --> 00:38:57,480
these are insects that have the larva

1034
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,800
Pupa adult life stage development now

1035
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,400
might don't have that they have a

1036
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,079
different sort of Life stage but it's

1037
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,119
basically like the earliest insects had

1038
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:07,200
where they just start off as a little

1039
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,680
nymph that looks like the adult and they

1040
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:11,480
get bigger and bigger and bigger and

1041
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:13,759
they they become the adult anyways

1042
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,119
that's your uh that's your evolutionary

1043
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,520
nutshell now that's great explanation I

1044
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:20,280
think that's helpful for not only me but

1045
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:22,119
many of my audience as well knowing the

1046
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,599
difference between those two so talk to

1047
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:26,119
us a little bit more about the big four

1048
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:28,160
that you mentioned as far as insects and

1049
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:30,200
like Solutions some Solutions in order

1050
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:33,239
to eliminate them yeah so the big four

1051
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:35,358
again flies beetles wasp bees and ants

1052
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:39,239
and uh

1053
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:40,960
moths and I think caterpillars the saral

1054
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:43,159
MS are like the biggest issue that most

1055
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,240
people are dealing with I think are the

1056
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:46,399
strongest one that people uh encounter

1057
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:49,639
because there's so many different ones

1058
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,480
out there uh across the Earth you're

1059
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:53,639
probably going to deal with some kind of

1060
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,039
caterpillar that can feed on the plant

1061
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:57,400
that you're dealing with and I think

1062
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:59,838
that the best way to deal with

1063
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,800
caterpillars is to First understand that

1064
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:03,719
generally they're going to become

1065
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:08,318
they're going to become active in the

1066
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:11,118
spring and um maybe late spring time and

1067
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:13,838
you're going to have populations usually

1068
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:16,720
that were pupating either in debris or

1069
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:19,159
they were in soil or something like that

1070
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:22,039
and then they they overwinter and they

1071
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:23,399
come out as adults at least if you're in

1072
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:24,920
a place where it Winters if you're in a

1073
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,160
tropical area they're probably just

1074
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,280
constantly around and that's important

1075
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:33,239
because this first population they're

1076
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,680
going to be moving across your region so

1077
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:38,759
if you're in the USA uh maybe they start

1078
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:41,358
off in like Southwest USA and then they

1079
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:44,480
move South uh Northeast essentially a

1080
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:46,078
northeasterly movement as the uh

1081
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,880
temperature increases you get more of

1082
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,079
them like with the budworm moth um helik

1083
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,318
veraza the corn earworm that people deal

1084
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:57,960
with with uh medicinal plants and really

1085
00:40:54,318 --> 00:41:00,679
like 200 plus crops across earth um they

1086
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,559
start off in the spring and summer they

1087
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:05,519
they ramp up into late summer they

1088
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:08,318
become super active and they move across

1089
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:10,358
earth or ac across the us from the Corn

1090
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:12,039
Belt especially so there's a place in

1091
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:15,119
the USA where most of the Corn is

1092
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:17,239
produced various States um like in kind

1093
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,680
of in the Midwest and North Midwest area

1094
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:22,959
mostly so that place is like a powder

1095
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:26,078
keg and then the MS will uh disperse

1096
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,318
from that location to other parts of the

1097
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,200
USA so if you kind of know that there's

1098
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:33,000
this Rhythm that you can pay attention

1099
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:34,919
to you can avert it by for example

1100
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,318
germinating later in the year or getting

1101
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,159
plants that germinate later in the year

1102
00:41:37,318 --> 00:41:41,480
uh or earlier in the year some way that

1103
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:44,039
allows you to harvest before or after

1104
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,760
the peak where the bud worms are going

1105
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:48,079
to go after the flower that's one

1106
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,720
example there are many ones out there

1107
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,119
got it some really good info there and I

1108
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:53,318
know there's a lot more that can be said

1109
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,039
about mites and insects uh we could have

1110
00:41:53,318 --> 00:41:57,960
a whole whole episode on each one of

1111
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:00,279
those topics really but let's let's keep

1112
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,318
it brief let's move on to the next thing

1113
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,079
we have here on the list which is fungi

1114
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:06,559
talk to us about fungi they're all kinds

1115
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,280
of fungi right but I think that my

1116
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:12,440
favorite ones to talk about are the uh

1117
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,440
powy milw and the necrot Tres the like

1118
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,920
Bettis and things like that I like to

1119
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:20,159
bring these up because they represent

1120
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:23,358
two different Pathways to colonizing

1121
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:26,078
plants P milw are what we call

1122
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:28,558
biotopes so they require a living host

1123
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,760
to feed on one interest interesting

1124
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:33,000
thing about powdery mildew which you uh

1125
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:35,280
heard me talk about the soil Summit was

1126
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,599
that powdery mildew if you go back far

1127
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,839
enough they're related to fungi that

1128
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,519
broke down plant tissues um so they have

1129
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:45,599
the same genes that they use to break

1130
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:47,759
down the cellulose in plant cells so

1131
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,559
perhaps they evolved from these fungi

1132
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,800
that used to break down decaying plant

1133
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:53,440
matter and they became really good at

1134
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,880
breaking down living plant matter

1135
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,280
instead so they became parasites I think

1136
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,680
that's really interesting when it comes

1137
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,559
the soil food web and that kind of thing

1138
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:04,838
where what could be a beneficial can

1139
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:07,599
eventually become a parasite given

1140
00:43:04,838 --> 00:43:10,400
enough time and uh you know uh

1141
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,960
familiarity with the host so to speak

1142
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,400
and powdery mildew they um they are not

1143
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,880
systemic some people think they're

1144
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,480
systemic pathogen but things like

1145
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,119
petritis are or fusarium are whereas

1146
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:24,599
powder milw only exists on the epidermis

1147
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:28,000
of the plant so only kind of like skin

1148
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:29,160
deep but they um

1149
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,800
they uh they're really good at

1150
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:32,558
colonizing the plant once they've

1151
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,920
established so when you see different

1152
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:36,200
spots colonize um it's not because

1153
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,079
they're moving through the tissue is

1154
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:41,838
because they're recolonizing the host

1155
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:43,440
and powdery milw are not super

1156
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:45,960
detrimental to their plant host

1157
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,440
typically whereas things like petritis

1158
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:51,400
they get onto the plant they trick the

1159
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:54,159
plant to kill itself it tricks the cells

1160
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,280
to uh destroy themselves and they sop up

1161
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:57,679
the nutrients afterwards so they're a

1162
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,519
real threat

1163
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:02,039
and uh they can attack different parts

1164
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:04,199
of the plant petritis for example is

1165
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:06,719
commonly associated with the flower

1166
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:09,598
right uh with the rotting of floral

1167
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:11,358
tissue in particular you also get things

1168
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,720
like fusarium that will attack things

1169
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:15,639
like the roots or the stem and sometimes

1170
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:18,679
you have plants where everything looked

1171
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:20,879
fine but then like a few days later it

1172
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:22,440
suddenly starts to wilt um you don't

1173
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,400
know what's going on you check the roots

1174
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,960
and you see that there's um all kinds of

1175
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:30,358
like oozing you know tissue and

1176
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:33,039
dilapidated structures and it's because

1177
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:35,318
this fungus attacks the tissue and like

1178
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:37,239
immediately destroys the roots and once

1179
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:38,838
the roots are gone there's really not

1180
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:40,519
very much for the plant or if the stem

1181
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:42,119
is really damaged then there's not a lot

1182
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:44,039
of nutrient transfer it dies very

1183
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:45,358
quickly so you got to you got to know

1184
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:47,400
these two different kinds of fungies

1185
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:49,199
some of them are not a huge deal some of

1186
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,358
them are a huge deal and they can be a

1187
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:54,000
quick problem so having a plan knowing

1188
00:44:52,358 --> 00:44:56,199
that those things are even possible and

1189
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,159
then having something that you can apply

1190
00:44:56,199 --> 00:45:01,719
beforehand like a microbe or um or a

1191
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:03,480
compound or something like that and also

1192
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:05,358
just keeping your plants hygienic is

1193
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,920
also really helpful maybe chopping and

1194
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:09,318
dropping is not always the greatest when

1195
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:12,559
it comes to these uh pathogens that can

1196
00:45:09,318 --> 00:45:14,279
be uh on or in the tissues or if you are

1197
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:17,000
going to do something like that like

1198
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:20,079
compost it process it and then reapply

1199
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,960
it I had Bud rot before you know when

1200
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,519
you mentioned that it just brought up

1201
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:28,039
memories bad memories of course but

1202
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:31,119
Trisa had that I actually had indoors

1203
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:33,639
the oscillating fan died overnight and

1204
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:36,240
so uh there was just that stagnant air

1205
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:37,960
humidity rose right it ended up

1206
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:39,759
attacking four of my plants if I

1207
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,679
remember correctly four of the plants

1208
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:46,000
had buritis in it Bud rot and uh it was

1209
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:48,879
just really in the main Cola so uh these

1210
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,318
are plants where I had really huge Buds

1211
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,358
and it was really just this main Cola

1212
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:54,358
that kind of stuck up more there was Bud

1213
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:55,480
Rod right in the middle because of it

1214
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:58,358
and a lot of people was kind of

1215
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,119
surprised because you know obviously I

1216
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:02,920
corrected the problem right so this was

1217
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:04,599
late and flowering when the fan died I

1218
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,680
corrected the problem within I think 24

1219
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:08,440
to 48 hours right but correct me up

1220
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:10,519
wrong that is enough time in order for

1221
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,119
it to kind of establish from there and

1222
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:14,079
then I spent two more weeks growing the

1223
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:15,599
plants well that doesn't mean that since

1224
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,760
I have air circulation now that it's

1225
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,119
just going to stop growing right so

1226
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,280
it'll continue to spread right so I get

1227
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:24,760
to harvest and then realized oh my gosh

1228
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:27,640
I had Bud Rod it must have been from

1229
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:30,839
when my fan died two weeks ago so um

1230
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:32,838
that wasn't fun now I was able to still

1231
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:34,679
utilize the bottom buds that didn't have

1232
00:46:32,838 --> 00:46:35,960
Bud rot and I know some people are

1233
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:37,440
against that they say hey you got bud

1234
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,119
Rod one part of the plant throw away the

1235
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,039
entire plant other people are going to

1236
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,720
say hey just cut off that bud that's

1237
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:46,000
impacted the rest of the plant is fine

1238
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:47,558
what's your take on that yeah that's a

1239
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,480
good question because it is systemic

1240
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:51,119
like I said I think that if you're

1241
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,480
seeing like if you don't see the

1242
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,800
colonization of the the tissues itself

1243
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,480
so now you can't necessarily see some of

1244
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:00,440
these things cuz they're microsc opic

1245
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:03,159
right so I think that having a a

1246
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,519
cautious approach is definitely valid uh

1247
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:07,719
certainly you could do something like

1248
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:10,400
that generally though I think um at the

1249
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:11,719
very least like not at a homeg grow

1250
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,480
perspective when you're growing plants

1251
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:15,719
by yourselves like even if you have like

1252
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:18,639
produce like petritis will colonize the

1253
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:21,118
fruit tissue or the floral tissue um you

1254
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:22,799
know like you know maybe maybe discard

1255
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,760
the orange that has the fungus but maybe

1256
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,119
don't necessarily discard the orange or

1257
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:30,240
the or the fruit that has no signs of a

1258
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:33,800
of mosis essentially but if You' got

1259
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:36,879
like that moldy uh uh uh development

1260
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,720
that ferous oder maybe maybe cut that

1261
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,160
part out don't don't try your luck with

1262
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:44,078
that one I think that's totally valid um

1263
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:46,558
but from a commercial level you know you

1264
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,519
might be looking at different things uh

1265
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,480
you might be able to perceive through

1266
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:51,838
testing and other things if there is

1267
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,639
other stuff that you don't want people

1268
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:57,679
to be exposed to as well so it

1269
00:47:54,639 --> 00:48:00,358
definitely makes sense to to be cautious

1270
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:02,558
um and I think that also one other thing

1271
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:04,799
I like to say is that bud rot doesn't

1272
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,480
necessarily only colonize the floral

1273
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,720
tissue and in some cases in some plants

1274
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,960
uh it can be a folar pathogen or even a

1275
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:15,358
stem or root pathogen I don't wish Bud R

1276
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:17,880
upon anyone it is not fun at all it's

1277
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:19,400
it's the feeling of going all the way to

1278
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,480
the point where you're ready to harvest

1279
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,838
and realizing that you've got bud rot

1280
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,480
it's just a feeling that I don't want

1281
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:29,400
anybody to have such a waste

1282
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,960
it just feels so bad I totally agree

1283
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:34,358
with that let's get into bacteria next

1284
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,199
so yeah just open-ended question there

1285
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:38,880
talk to us what you know about bacteria

1286
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:41,439
and what we need to know basically with

1287
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:44,160
regards to IPM and also with regards to

1288
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,920
plant Health the most interesting thing

1289
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:48,399
for me is that the there's this like

1290
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,838
idea that there's like a fungal or

1291
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,160
bacterial dominance that you might be

1292
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:55,679
looking to accentuate and I think that

1293
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:58,480
that's not necessarily the a correct

1294
00:48:55,679 --> 00:49:00,358
dichotomy um there's bacteria that are

1295
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,920
beneficial those that are detrimental

1296
00:49:00,358 --> 00:49:04,920
and then those that even work with each

1297
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,920
other as well um it's hard to get a good

1298
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:10,920
snapshot of the microbes going going on

1299
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:15,079
in the uh soil microbiome but also even

1300
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:17,240
on the um phytol plane of the foliage um

1301
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:20,760
I think that it helps to Envision the

1302
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:22,399
plant's surface as like a hostile

1303
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:27,559
environment for the most part you got

1304
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:30,358
these Jagged tricomes and um sto and wax

1305
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:32,480
and secretions and things and I think

1306
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:35,119
that without getting into too much

1307
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,960
detail one of the best things people can

1308
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:40,000
do from an IPM perspective is try to

1309
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,559
apply some of these bacteria that have a

1310
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,400
pathogenic effect against parasites uh

1311
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,400
but not just insect semites but also

1312
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,480
like fungi there's bacteria that you can

1313
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,838
apply and even fungi as well that you

1314
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:55,119
can apply to the foliage and to um other

1315
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:58,078
tissues like the roots that will uh

1316
00:49:55,119 --> 00:50:01,000
either colonize the those tissues uh

1317
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,440
internally or just on the surface and

1318
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,719
they will create a disruptive

1319
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:07,760
environment where other microbes that

1320
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:10,159
you don't want are not able to uh

1321
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,480
colonize very well you can also combine

1322
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:14,239
this with so not just microbes or

1323
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,679
bacteria that

1324
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:18,318
parasitize like fungi and other bacteria

1325
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:20,118
but also those that produce

1326
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:22,400
antimicrobial compounds and that kind of

1327
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:24,079
a thing but the most important thing is

1328
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,760
to find things that will play nicely

1329
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:29,440
with each other and there's a lot more

1330
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:31,240
research to cover but um if we take a

1331
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,358
look at the Ecology of microbes and

1332
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:35,759
bacteria on different kinds of plants we

1333
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:37,239
can find what works maybe more generally

1334
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,400
and then apply those to other plants

1335
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:41,199
that kind of research is ongoing

1336
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,000
bacteria is super fascinating I mean

1337
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:46,078
once I learned that

1338
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,280
99.9% of the bacteria we haven't even

1339
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,839
discovered yet or researched yet it just

1340
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:52,880
blew my mind that there's so much that

1341
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:54,480
we don't know and so much more to

1342
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,400
uncover and we won't uncover It In Our

1343
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,719
Lifetime that's for sure and the next

1344
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,838
thing to talk about is is pretty

1345
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:02,078
interesting to me as well which is

1346
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:03,480
viruses so uh again want to hand the

1347
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,519
microphone over to you and just drop

1348
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,440
some knowledge bombs on us in regards to

1349
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:09,440
viruses what do we need to know here's

1350
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,480
the biggest knowledge bomb um I was

1351
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:15,039
reading a report recently that talked

1352
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:18,798
about the uh sort of evolution of

1353
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:22,798
viruses and basically they talked about

1354
00:51:18,798 --> 00:51:25,920
how it's it's it's possible that when

1355
00:51:22,798 --> 00:51:28,679
cellular Life as We Know It And even

1356
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,838
pre-cellular Life as we know it sort of

1357
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:32,960
developed things like viroids for

1358
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:35,558
example are not quite viruses right

1359
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:38,280
they're like strands of RNA and thought

1360
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:41,240
that there was a pre-dna world an RNA

1361
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:47,559
world and that vroid are basically like

1362
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:50,959
a reli of that era of life history and

1363
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:52,720
viruses though perhaps especially RNA

1364
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,639
viruses they may have been like the

1365
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:57,039
first things that

1366
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:58,920
became uh like

1367
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:01,159
what we now think of as the nucleus of

1368
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:05,318
cells it's possible that as like a

1369
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:07,960
genetic component viruses are basically

1370
00:52:05,318 --> 00:52:10,759
you know part of us and have been for

1371
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:15,000
the entirety of cellular life on

1372
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:16,359
Earth knowledge bomb but um so what I'm

1373
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,838
trying to say here is that we shouldn't

1374
00:52:16,358 --> 00:52:20,440
be surprised that um there are various

1375
00:52:18,838 --> 00:52:22,719
kinds of viruses out there some of them

1376
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:24,519
are detrimental obviously but actually a

1377
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:26,598
lot of them are either neutral or even

1378
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:30,159
beneficial for their hosts some of them

1379
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:34,280
them exists inside our genome uh as

1380
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:37,118
retroviruses some of them um can escape

1381
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:40,280
uh or genetic codes that escape from

1382
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:42,680
other cells and things like that um so

1383
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:45,240
that's a little bit high-minded but uh I

1384
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:46,879
think it shows uh contextually exactly

1385
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:50,199
what we're dealing with here these

1386
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:53,000
organisms or not organisms that are like

1387
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:54,838
quasi life and um they're around and

1388
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,119
they basically work like

1389
00:52:54,838 --> 00:53:00,880
molecular um

1390
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:03,280
uh additions basically um and so

1391
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,160
bringing it down to IPM though we have

1392
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,160
things like viroids that are huge pain

1393
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:10,318
for exactly that reason it's because

1394
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:13,719
things like hot PL and vroid you know

1395
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:16,318
they they're basically strog gentic code

1396
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:19,199
that our cells or in this case the plant

1397
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:22,239
cells they take and they go oh this is

1398
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:24,558
plant RNA let me replicate you and by

1399
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:27,358
replicating the RNA of the viroid and

1400
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:30,040
not everything else is supposed to do

1401
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:32,639
for the cell you get these weird things

1402
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:34,239
like stunting closis other kinds of

1403
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:36,920
weird damage because you have these

1404
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:38,838
Oddball genes that are just not being uh

1405
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:42,480
expressed in the plant which are very

1406
00:53:38,838 --> 00:53:44,679
important and so viruses also um they

1407
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,639
can do things weird like you've got

1408
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:48,960
these recombination viruses where their

1409
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:50,358
genome is split up into different chunks

1410
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,559
and they move between different plants

1411
00:53:50,358 --> 00:53:55,199
and then recombine with each other um

1412
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,640
it's very fascinating um and

1413
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:59,078
unfortunately there's not a whole a lot

1414
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:01,440
of conventional solutions for viruses

1415
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:03,039
because they're basically genetic code

1416
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,720
and it's very hard to Target genetic

1417
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:08,039
code without targeting the plants code

1418
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:10,558
too it's pretty scary you know once I

1419
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:13,358
heard particularly about hot plade vroid

1420
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:15,720
being identified at 73% of commercial

1421
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:17,239
facilities in the US it just kind of

1422
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:21,439
blew my mind and the fact that in

1423
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:23,279
California alone 90% of facilities uh

1424
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,880
medicinal plants tested positive for hot

1425
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,240
PL and viroids so I can only imagine the

1426
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,720
amount of people that are that have hot

1427
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:32,679
plade and vroid in their garden and

1428
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:34,798
don't know it and they are seeing

1429
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:37,118
deficiency seeing plant problems and

1430
00:54:34,798 --> 00:54:38,719
trying to figure it out but it's really

1431
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:41,160
a vroid which they really can't do

1432
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:43,798
anything about so it's really scary I

1433
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:47,000
know it comes into it can be within the

1434
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:49,599
seed it can be transferred in water as

1435
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,559
well next week the guest that's coming

1436
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,760
on this podcast is going to talk all

1437
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:55,240
about hot plade and viroids so you guys

1438
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,079
stay tuned for that one that's going to

1439
00:54:55,239 --> 00:54:58,919
be real in depth all about hot PL and

1440
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:00,920
vroid and I'm looking forward to that

1441
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,960
conversation now is there any other

1442
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:05,680
viruses or viroids besides hot PL and

1443
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:08,079
vroid that's kind of worthy of of

1444
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:10,078
mentioning and keeping an eye out for

1445
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,960
yeah so I want to say one thing about

1446
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:15,559
hot plon vroid uh in particular is that

1447
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,318
it was recently found that other plants

1448
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:19,519
like we call the we give viruses these

1449
00:55:17,318 --> 00:55:22,440
names typically the first host we find

1450
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:25,719
them in and a symptom that they have

1451
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:28,679
about them like tobacco mosaic virus

1452
00:55:25,719 --> 00:55:32,239
right for example example um so hop

1453
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:33,719
latent vroid right and what what's

1454
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:35,479
interesting though is that hopl virid

1455
00:55:33,719 --> 00:55:39,000
has been found in things like tomato

1456
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:41,159
sunflower cucumber and um its ability to

1457
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,760
transfer from parent Offspring through

1458
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:45,480
seed uh and other older research was

1459
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,599
kind of low in newer research it's

1460
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:50,960
showing really high transmission rates

1461
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:53,240
vertically from parent to offspring um

1462
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,720
so it can be not just in hop it could be

1463
00:55:53,239 --> 00:55:57,038
in other plants too that you might be

1464
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:58,598
growing in your garden it could in other

1465
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:01,319
commercial plants that are being sold

1466
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:02,838
right now they're not being tested um so

1467
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:05,199
that's just a thing to consider so I

1468
00:56:02,838 --> 00:56:07,719
would definitely check out that vroid

1469
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:09,798
video upcoming um there's a lot of

1470
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:12,798
information that we should be kept up on

1471
00:56:09,798 --> 00:56:14,838
other viroids though there's um um there

1472
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:18,318
are stunt viroids in other kinds of

1473
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:20,759
plants uh Citrus um gets a vroid for

1474
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:23,239
example um that's pretty common peanut

1475
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:25,319
for example um but there's also viroids

1476
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:28,159
that have been found in the human oral

1477
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:30,759
microbiome uh or Le virid like things

1478
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:34,598
recently it came out these so-called

1479
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:37,119
Obelisk like um uh viroids that were

1480
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:39,880
found in the bacteria in our own mouths

1481
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,880
and in all the continents on earth they

1482
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,318
uh they went through and they

1483
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:47,318
categorized the genetic structure of

1484
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:50,159
these obelisks and they found them in

1485
00:56:47,318 --> 00:56:52,558
human samples so we even have viroids in

1486
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:55,480
it around ourselves too it seems like

1487
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:57,720
and as our ability to sequence and look

1488
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,519
in finer and finer detail increases

1489
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:03,000
we'll probably be able to find more and

1490
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:05,519
more things like that um generally

1491
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,318
though I mean like uh there's a there's

1492
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:10,038
some viruses that are going around right

1493
00:57:07,318 --> 00:57:15,960
now in tomato they are a huge deal a

1494
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:18,760
ringspot virus for example um there are

1495
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:20,720
um I guess the another big one that

1496
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,520
people are dealing with a lot is be krop

1497
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:25,038
virus very common a lot of people know

1498
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:27,199
about it um it's spreading all

1499
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:30,640
throughout uh various medicinal plants

1500
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:32,798
in the USA and abroad um it's vectored

1501
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:36,558
by the Beet Leaf Hopper pretty much

1502
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:40,119
solely and we have found that uh viruses

1503
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:43,559
that are like 95 to 98% the same as like

1504
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:45,880
vir bctv we find in tomatoes and peppers

1505
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:47,519
in the area they're coming back very

1506
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:49,760
similar so it means that these beat Leaf

1507
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:51,318
Hoppers are going into crops and they're

1508
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,520
taking up the virus and then they're

1509
00:57:51,318 --> 00:57:55,519
moving into medicinal crops and other

1510
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:57,639
plants and also plants that are just

1511
00:57:55,519 --> 00:58:00,000
living around around in the environment

1512
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:02,279
and they act as reservoirs and so if you

1513
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,280
live in these areas like Nevada and

1514
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:08,960
Arizona and other places where bctv is

1515
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:11,000
very common um or Colorado then uh you

1516
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,960
should be aware of that and have some

1517
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,920
plans for finding the symptoms which is

1518
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:18,400
usually like a stunting in the leaves

1519
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,960
and a curling of the leaves and

1520
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,079
chlorosis as well but if you're suspect

1521
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,440
you should definitely get it tested uh

1522
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:27,280
to find out if you can cuz then you know

1523
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,200
that probably you won't be able to find

1524
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,039
a solution unfortunately and then you

1525
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:33,358
should use your resources for something

1526
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:34,760
else super interesting stuff yeah it's

1527
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:37,358
good that there is some testing out

1528
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:39,480
there now that you can get if you feel

1529
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:41,038
like you might have virus go out and get

1530
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,480
it tested there's some affordable

1531
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:45,359
options out there so that's good stuff

1532
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:47,639
so one of the questions I like to ask uh

1533
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:49,719
almost on every episode towards the end

1534
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:50,879
is really looking for advice like I

1535
00:58:49,719 --> 00:58:53,118
mentioned we have a lot of beginners

1536
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,960
that tune into this podcast what advice

1537
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:57,160
do you have for beginners who are

1538
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:01,358
battling pests for the first time I

1539
00:58:57,159 --> 00:59:04,358
think the number one advice for

1540
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:06,558
especially for beginners is to learn

1541
00:59:04,358 --> 00:59:09,078
what pests you might be able to deal

1542
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:11,039
with so not just for your particular

1543
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:13,280
region although that's very crucial and

1544
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:14,760
you can find information out from

1545
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,839
various kinds of research reports you

1546
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:19,280
can look up there are extension agents

1547
00:59:16,838 --> 00:59:21,599
for various places in the world that you

1548
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,960
can go to to find out what is a problem

1549
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:25,119
in your region for the plants that

1550
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,760
you're trying to grow and then also

1551
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:28,920
having a plan so if you already know

1552
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,680
some of those pests or you've

1553
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,318
encountered them already then learning

1554
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:34,919
about not only those but the ones that

1555
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:38,679
you might not have encountered yet is so

1556
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:41,039
important it's so useful it's like gold

1557
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:44,279
because you aren't going to be running

1558
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:45,799
around um panicking because you've never

1559
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,319
dealt with this problem before and you

1560
00:59:45,798 --> 00:59:49,798
don't know what to do and you've never

1561
00:59:47,318 --> 00:59:52,798
even looked into it so just having that

1562
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:54,280
it's just such a um just such a valuable

1563
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:56,280
thing in adversity to have that

1564
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,920
knowledge set in the beginning before

1565
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,920
you deal with a problem that's probably

1566
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,559
the number one advice I completely agree

1567
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:04,440
with that okay so let's wrap things up

1568
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,798
tell us how can the listeners find you

1569
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,679
and what do you have upcoming in the

1570
01:00:05,798 --> 01:00:10,038
future you can find me for professional

1581
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:39,039
community of about maybe 140 people now

1582
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:41,440
um for advice regarding IPM and that

1583
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:43,119
sort of a thing so that's also an an

1584
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:46,119
option as well if you're interested

1585

patreon.com/lenguin

1586
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:00,920
ever swarm concept it's basically um all

1587
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,200
you need to know about IPM some

1588
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:05,960
highlevel Theory out there and also some

1589
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:08,679
practical applications of a system of

1590
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:11,440
systems approach and a multi-domain uh

1591
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:13,838
holistic approach to Pest Management not

1592
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,318
just products on a list but how can you

1593
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:19,519
look at the ecosystem pests plants and

1594
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:21,440
all the various organisms therein and

1595
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:23,318
I'm very excited to work on it hopefully

1596
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,720
I'll be done sometime at the end of this

1597
01:01:23,318 --> 01:01:28,400
year or beginning of next year awesome

1598
01:01:25,719 --> 01:01:30,078
well Matthew once again this was loaded

1599
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,358
with information I appreciate you

1600
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:34,480
dropping those knowledge bombs on us I

1601
01:01:32,358 --> 01:01:36,519
learned so much and I have a feeling a

1602
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,559
lot of my audience has learned so much
