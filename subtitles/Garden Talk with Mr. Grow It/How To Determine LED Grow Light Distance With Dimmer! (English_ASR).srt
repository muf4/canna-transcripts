1
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,638
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,559
know me my name is chris aka mr growit

3
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,399
and today i got a topic video for you by

4
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,198
far one of the most common questions i

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,278
get here in 2021 is what should my light

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,039
distance be when using the dimmer on my

7
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,118
grow light and the answer to this can be

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,039
a little tricky since not all grow

9
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,800
lights are created equal if you dim down

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,240
to a certain percentage on one fixture

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,240
you're not going to get the same power

12
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,000
output as dimming down that same

13
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,519
percentage on another fixture but there

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,759
is a few things that you can do in order

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,359
to make an educated guess on what the

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,119
light distance should be when using the

17
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,558
dimmer at different levels and that's

18
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:41,759
what i'm going to get into today but

19
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,519
before we get to the video i want to

20
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,238
give a quick shout out to our sponsor of

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,000
today's video mars hydro

22
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:49,839
thanks to mars hydro for sponsoring this

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,759
video check out their multi-chamber

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,520
tents these grow tents are becoming more

25
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,280
and more popular since you can have

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,440
plants in the vegetation stage in one

27
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,960
chamber and then flowering plants on a

28
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,280
different light cycle in the other

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,000
chamber mars hydra also now has inline

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,840
fans they have forage and six-inch

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,079
versions using either a thermostat

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,760
controller or speed controller and then

33
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:13,679
one last thing to mention is that mars

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,799
hydro is now using samsung lm3o1h diodes

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,320
in their fc 6500 led grow light these

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,320
are arguably the best diodes on the

37
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,158
market today i will leave a link to the

38
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,319
website down in the description section

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,880
below and you can use coupon code mr

40
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,279
grow it for a discount on their products

41
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,280
okay now let's get into the topic today

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,280
which is using the dimmer and

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,439
determining what the grow light distance

44
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,599
should be from the top of the plants to

45
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,599
the fixture there's really three steps

46
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,000
to determine this number one the first

47
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,319
step would be to look at the grow lights

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,239
par chart now these days all good grow

49
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,839
lights do come with a par chart you can

50
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,438
find that on the grow light listing

51
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,118
we're gonna touch a little bit on what

52
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,879
par is on this video but i do have a

53
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,359
separate video that gets deeper into

54
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,640
part talking about exactly what par is

55
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,599
and also a couple different ways to

56
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,680
measure it ppf and ppfd so i won't get

57
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,679
too detailed in this video but on the

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,520
outro card of this video i'll link that

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,080
video so in case you guys want to watch

60
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,919
that and learn about ppf and ppfd more

61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080
in detail but really what par is in

62
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,519
layman's terms is really just a range of

63
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,920
light that the plant uses for

64
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,520
photosynthesis photosynthetically active

65
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,958
radiation is what it stands for so on

66
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,040
your grow light listing this should be a

67
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,800
part chart it should really be kind of a

68
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,639
square and there should be different

69
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,000
numbers and with many of these new grow

70
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,559
lights they're going to have different

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,840
charts for different light distances

72
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,280
back in the day a lot of companies used

73
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,920
to mislead consumers and they used to

74
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,840
just put the dead center

75
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,359
number and that's it so you know the

76
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,280
strongest point the dead center of the

77
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,959
footprint what that measurement was but

78
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,878
you wouldn't know any other measurements

79
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,120
on the footprint these days full part

80
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,878
charts are available again with any good

81
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,560
grow light on the market so that's the

82
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,959
first step is to look at those par

83
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,280
charts and get an idea of what the ppfd

84
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,439
numbers are for each of the light

85
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,080
distances that they list next step is to

86
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,680
understand the general par ranges for

87
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,200
plants now it depends on what plant

88
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,840
you're growing something like leafy

89
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,158
greens lettuce kale spinach they're

90
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,239
going to need a lot less light than some

91
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,598
other plants which require highlight for

92
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,800
the plant that we all know and love

93
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:14,959
general ranges are 200 to 400 ppfd for

94
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,280
seedlings clones and mother plants 400

95
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,319
to 600 ppfd for plants in the vegetation

96
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,759
stage and 600 to 900 ppfd for plants in

97
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,839
the flowering stage now if you're

98
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,439
supplementing co2 you can go higher than

99
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,878
those numbers again those are just

100
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,439
general ranges but if you are

101
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,280
supplementing co2 and giving your plants

102
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,000
more light your other conditions have to

103
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,840
be dialed in temperature humidity and of

104
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,840
course nutrition so you've looked at the

105
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,799
part charts on the grow light listings

106
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,039
and you're seeing the different

107
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,360
distances there and what the ppfd

108
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,519
numbers are at the different distances

109
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,200
and now you're aware of what the plant's

110
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,439
requirements are for the different

111
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,679
stages of growth in ppfd and then the

112
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,039
last step is to do the math so once i

113
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,200
tell you this step some of you are going

114
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,959
to be like uh oh yeah why didn't i think

115
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,039
of this and then others would be like oh

116
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,719
yeah that's common sense of course why

117
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,079
wouldn't you do that either way there's

118
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,000
a lot of people that don't know about

119
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,680
this so i figured i'd make a video and

120
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,120
then when i get that question about what

121
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,040
the light distance should be with the

122
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,120
dimmer i can simply forward people this

123
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,639
video so do the math for example if

124
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,039
you're looking at the part chart and at

125
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,519
the light distance of 12 inches dead

126
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,120
center ppfd is 1000 that's with the

127
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,120
dimmer at 100

128
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,959
well if you turn the dimmer down to

129
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,040
50 percent what's 50 of a thousand 500

130
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,319
so a rough estimate and again this isn't

131
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,919
going to be perfect they're going to be

132
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,000
a lot of variables if you're in a grow

133
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,839
tent and you have reflective walls they

134
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,600
could skew the numbers versus if you're

135
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,039
in an open space and you don't have

136
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,840
those reflective walls well then you're

137
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,520
probably going to get different

138
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,239
measurements again this is to give you a

139
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:45,279
general idea of what the par output is

140
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,400
so 12 inches 1000 ppfd at 100 turn it

141
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,719
down to 50 500 ppfd right half of that

142
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:53,279
1000. so what if you're at 12 inches

143
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,880
1000 ppfd dead center you turn the

144
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,079
dimmer down to 80

145
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:00,319
800 ppfd right so 80 of 1

146
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,680
800 ppfd and there may even be some

147
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,680
people that comment to this video and

148
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,079
say that's not correct if you dim it

149
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,400
down to 50 it's not going to be 50 of

150
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,399
the 100 value so i did actually put this

151
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,478
to the test just to prove it let's take

152
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:15,120
a look at the results right now

153
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,719
okay so the first one up is the es180

154
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,160
led grow light by the green sunshine

155
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,840
company at full power it pulls 200 watts

156
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,919
from the wall you can see that on my

157
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:27,439
kilowatt meter here and my part meter is

158
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:30,959
showing 485 ppfd so if you divide that

159
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:34,800
by two what we're looking for is 242.5

160
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:36,319
let's round up 243 ppfd is what it

161
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,879
should be at 50

162
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,800
so right now i'm dialing the dimmer down

163
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,360
i'm doing my best guess to estimate

164
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,520
where the 50 mark is i'm also using the

165
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,639
kilowatt meter as a guide closest i can

166
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:50,599
get to halfway is 98.5 watts and then

167
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,319
looking at the par meter that's showing

168
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:57,039
250 ppfd so that's very close only about

169
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,800
seven ppfd off so this example was

170
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,680
pretty solid let's move on to the next

171
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,720
one the sf 2000 led grill light by

172
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,280
spider farmer full power here it shows

173
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,240
202 watts and then my par meter is

174
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:13,038
showing a 515 ppfd

175
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,639
so if we dim it down to 50 we should see

176
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,839
about 258 ppfd you can see the dimmer is

177
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,960
set to 50

178
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:24,638
and it's showing 200 ppfds so we're a

179
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:26,799
little bit off there we're about 58 ppfd

180
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,240
off definitely still within the ballpark

181
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,639
so i wouldn't say it was wildly

182
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,519
different by any means and the 50 was

183
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,519
actually showing 72.3 watts so actually

184
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,599
a little bit less than half and just one

185
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,599
last thing i want to do is dial it up so

186
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,879
it is exactly 50

187
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,560
via watts so it was 202 watts full power

188
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,279
dimming it down the closest i could get

189
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,280
it was 99.3 watts and on the dimmer that

190
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,638
actually shows 60

191
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,839
and the ppfd is about 266. the light is

192
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,598
moving that's why you're seeing the

193
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,119
measurement go up and down a little bit

194
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:58,560
so yeah this kilowatt meter is actually

195
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,560
something that can help dial in that

196
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,280
halfway mark i think i spent around 20

197
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,720
bucks for this meter so not too bad

198
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,559
it's not going to be perfect i don't

199
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,680
know how many times i have to say this

200
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,800
because i just have a feeling that there

201
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,120
are going to be people in the comments

202
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,960
section that say this isn't perfect this

203
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,319
isn't exact right i'm telling you that

204
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,719
right now it's to give you a general

205
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,400
idea of what the power output is now you

206
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,560
could always go and buy a par meter and

207
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,318
take measurements that way this video is

208
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,560
really for the folks that don't have the

209
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,479
money to spend on a par meter they can

210
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,680
be very expensive i personally have the

211
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:32,560
apple gmq 500 par meter i think it runs

212
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,199
about 525 for that one it measures from

213
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,280
400 to 700 nanometers which is your

214
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,720
traditional power range you're gonna be

215
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,119
able to measure led grow lights as well

216
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,080
as hid grow lights with that par meter i

217
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,759
also have the apple gmq 620 which is an

218
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,878
extended range par meter measures from

219
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,439
340 nanometers up to 1040 nanometers so

220
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,000
it's actually going to go into uv as

221
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,478
well as go up into far red ir i think

222
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,038
this meter was about

223
00:07:55,478 --> 00:08:00,959
575 i believe 575 dollars so they're

224
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,878
pretty expensive now there are cheaper

225
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,478
par meters on the market some are more

226
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,720
accurate than others and now there's

227
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,159
also apps that you can use that you can

228
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,319
actually measure power directly from

229
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,759
your smartphone with those as well some

230
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,439
are more accurate than others i'm

231
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,759
actually about to release a garden talk

232
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,240
podcast episode with shane from micro

233
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,120
led and he talks all about measuring par

234
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,918
and he talks about some of the

235
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,680
alternatives to the apogee par meters so

236
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,519
stay tuned for that episode when that

237
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,360
episode is released i'll link it down in

238
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,038
the description section below and also

239
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,479
put it in the outro card as well so

240
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,080
we'll have that par video that i spoke

241
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,918
about and also have that episode with

242
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,919
shane from micro next to it so i hope

243
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,838
that makes sense i hope that helps some

244
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,598
of you that don't have the money to go

245
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,760
and buy a par meter you should now be

246
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,919
able to make an educated guess on what

247
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,439
the grow like distance should be when

248
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:46,799
using the dimmer that's pretty much it

249
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,640
for this video guys if you enjoyed it

250
