1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,509
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:05,878
know me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:08,789
and you watch a mattress Channel perfect

4
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:11,460
works sent me over there 1000 W Cree

5
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:13,379
Cobb plus LED grow light and in this

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,690
video I'm going to unbox a unit I will

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,550
test the power output and I'll do a heat

8
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:19,108
test on it I'm not gonna go over all of

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,580
the features that the scroll light has

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,439
but I will link it in the description

11
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:24,509
section below so you can learn more

12
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,539
about it first thing out the box here is

13
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:31,618
a wire hanging kit here's another wire

14
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:35,820
hanging kit next is a power cord and

15
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:38,100
lastly is the LED grow light for the

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,409
part test I'm going to use the appo gmq

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,250
500 power meter this meter measures from

18
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:46,709
389 nanometers to 692 nanometers and the

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,119
measurements are in ppfd I do these

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,250
videos just to give you a general idea

21
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,049
of what the power output is it's not

22
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,670
going to be on 2 percent accurate I take

23
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:55,799
measurements in grow tents which have

24
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,750
reflective walls that could increase the

25
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,459
numbers so just keep that in mind

26
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,259
the vegetative coverage area for this

27
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,210
grow light is full foot by 4 foot

28
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,429
according to the Amazon listing the

29
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,140
flower and coverage area is 4 foot by 3

30
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,790
foot however I was told that the

31
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,320
flowering coverage area was three foot

32
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,700
by 3 foot so when I show you the

33
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,709
measurements you'll see that I'm keeping

34
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,960
my power meter in a 3 foot by 3 foot

35
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:17,368
space I'm gonna take measurements at 3

36
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,438
different distances these are the

37
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:22,409
recommended distances listed on their

38
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:25,199
Amazon listing 18 inches 30 inches and

39
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,969
40 inches I've plugged al-led grill

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,320
light into my kilowatt meter and it

41
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:33,569
shows three point two six amps pulling

42
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,959
383 watts alright let's get into the

43
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:35,959
measurements

44
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:52,280

just reminder that there is a link to

61
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,499

62
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:33,810
section below and I'll leave it at that

63
