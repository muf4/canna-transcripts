1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,039
coming up on Garden talk feminized seeds

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,859
are seeds that are 98 to 99 female

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,379
plants so you pop them and you are more

4
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:16,019
than sure that will be females I never

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:20,160
start with seed plants I always start

6
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:23,239
with clones that are tested that are

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,820
very well known that are very very

8
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:29,278
valuable the most important thing on a

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,099
breeding project like I said is the

10
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:34,738
genetics that you breed with

11
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:37,558
and the health of the plants the veg

12
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:41,699
nutrients the high content of nitrogen

13
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:44,039
will help create and harvest a lot more

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,820
seeds than if you use a bloom nutrient

15
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:51,799
if you do this right from one plant you

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,799
can get like thousands of seeds

17
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,058

regular seeds I think they really like

111
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,699
the ability to grow plants from seed and

112
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,979
for it to always be female not have to

113
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,720
worry about male plants so in this

114
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:44,639
episode I like to have more of a

115

regards to getting started breeding and

117

coming from bodybuilding background so

125
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:15,299
I've been bodybuilding for the last 18

126
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,360
years of my life I started bodybuilding

127
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,579
when I was like 13 years old and right

128
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,340
when I started became a passion for me

129
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:25,139
and I got obsessed with bodybuilding and

130
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:27,060
I wanted to become a professional

131
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,400
bodybuilder from like when I was 14

132
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,339
years old so

133
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:35,038
um I follow my dream and at 20 years old

134
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:38,939
I came to us to compete in a

135
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:42,538
bodybuilding show and I stayed here uh

136
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:47,418
for the rest of the remaining time I

137
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:49,978
come here in 2008 and I reached my

138
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:54,120
lifetime goal to become a professional

139
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:57,418
bodybuilder at 30 years old after uh

140
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,879
almost 16 years of chasing this dream

141
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:02,879
and coming all the way from Eastern

142
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:05,038
Europe Romania to us was a huge

143
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:08,038
transition but uh

144
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:10,620
I always had that passion to to for

145
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:13,740
bodybuilding and I want to make it all

146
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:16,379
the way where I put my dream at so right

147
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,720
after I finish bodybuilding and I

148
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:20,939
reached my main goal to become a

149
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,979
professional bodybuilding kind of I

150
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:26,100
start to kind of get depressed because I

151
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:29,459
even had another thing to aim for you

152
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:32,340
know I reached my goal that I was trying

153
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:35,219
to get for the last 16 years now I'm

154
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:37,859
here and I'm kind of kind of lost I

155
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:42,419
don't know what to do anymore so that's

156
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:45,360
when I discovered growing and I

157
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:47,519
immediately got passionate about growing

158
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,139
you know I start with three little

159
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:54,959
clones back in 2019 and

160
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:57,180
it became a passion right away like

161
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:59,879
right away I was there every single

162
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,819
second opening my closet door to check

163
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:05,100
on the plants and doing research for

164
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:08,340
like hours and hours and hours and

165
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:11,160
losing nights uh watching YouTube videos

166
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:14,219
watching you and all the other like

167
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,979
people on YouTube uh on how to and

168
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,160
trying to learn how to grow and going

169
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:22,800
back into my little Growing Experience

170
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:26,280
and things evolved pretty fast for me

171
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,400
because I dive so deep into it like with

172
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,978
bodybuilding I put everything I had all

173
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:36,120
my focus and all my uh my time into

174
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:40,800
growing and I um I evolved pretty pretty

175
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:45,598
quick from my first grow in a closet in

176
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,579
uh in uh in soil with uh Flora not Flora

177
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:51,800
Flex with uh with with

178
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:51,800
um with salt nutrients

179
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:58,439
I I I get I got into my second grow

180
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,680
where I did deep water culture and I

181
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:06,000
grew one single plant in a five by five

182
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,639
space where I got massive results uh

183
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,639
from that plant I got a massive yield

184
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,978
and I got great results and that built

185
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:18,660
my confidence also I want to mention

186
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:21,120
that the plant was in my life while I

187
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,099
was doing bodybuilding it helped me

188
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,560
reach my goal to become a professional

189
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:29,000
bodybuilding by

190
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,500
um give me relief from pain because

191
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,259
bodybuilding is a very very demanding

192
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,240
sport where you have to lift a lot of

193
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:39,718
weight and you have all kinds of joint

194
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,778
pains or muscle pains so I used the

195
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:45,720
medicinal properties of the plant long

196
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:48,838
before to start growing so when I

197
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,720
started growing was like I really need

198
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,240
to learn everything about this and I

199
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,060
dived you've been to it and that's where

200
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,440
I am right now awesome and then how long

201
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:00,838
have you been breeding when did that

202
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,300
come in and what I like to ask I've had

203
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,760
a handful of breeders on this podcast in

204
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:09,299
the past small handful and I like to ask

205
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:12,419
them what makes you a reputable breeder

206
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:17,219
okay first of all I'm not considered

207
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:20,458
myself a breeder yet I aim to become one

208
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:23,100
of the best breeders in the game but at

209
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:26,579
this moment I'm not considering myself a

210
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,040
breeder I'm just learning and experience

211
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:33,180
and doing all kinds of projects to

212
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:36,240
perfect my uh my skills but I'm not

213
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:39,179
considering myself a breather yet I've

214
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,860
been breathing just for a little uh over

215
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:44,639
a year now

216
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:47,278
but like I said as with growing I'm

217
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:50,759
diving deep in and I'm doing a lot of

218
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:53,580
research I'm um I'm listening to a lot

219
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:57,059
of books about reading about plant

220
00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:00,420
health and everything like that so

221
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:03,139
um I'm trying to perfect my breathing uh

222
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:07,019
projects every single time I'm doing it

223
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:09,539
and uh what made me different it's the

224
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:12,778
passion that I put into the plant the

225
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:16,919
energy that I put into the plant and the

226
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:19,620
approach that I have of of breeding that

227
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:22,799
will get later on will get on later on

228
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:25,320
you know okay and then before we

229
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,838
actually met here we talked about what

230
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,580
the what the topic would be and I sent

231
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,920
you some questions in regards to

232
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,720
breeding and the first set of questions

233
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,299
I sent you was was inbreeding right

234
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,259
going from like F1 F2 F3 and you had

235
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:39,120
mentioned that you haven't really

236
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:42,240
ventured into that Avenue yet that you

237
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,259
specialized in feminized so that's kind

238
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,299
of what we're going to focus on today

239
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:47,039
but for those that don't know feminize

240
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:51,000
can you break it break it down for us

241
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,679
what is meant by feminized so in simple

242
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,519
words you take a

243
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:57,299
fell clone plant and you reverse it with

244
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:01,019
a

245
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:03,599
with a spray uh and you turn it into a

246
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:07,879
male and now you take the pollen from

247
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:11,159
these female slash male plant and you

248
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:14,458
pollinate another female plant and you

249
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:17,100
get five feminized seeds so feminized

250
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:22,559
seeds are seeds that are

251
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:24,839
uh 98 to 99 uh female plants so you pop

252
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,599
them and you are more than sure that

253
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:31,560
will be females uh the thing with the

254
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,440
feminite seeds they are not as stable as

255
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:37,799
the regular seeds that mean they can

256
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:41,399
harm if the genetics are not mixing

257
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:43,139
together well but what I'm what I'm

258
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,320
getting it is

259
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:48,419
if you pop regular seeds and you want

260
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:54,420
just female plants you have chances of

261
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:57,479
50 female 50 male so you are 50 50 but

262
00:11:54,419 --> 00:12:01,620
if you pop feminine seeds you have got

263
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:05,039
99 chances to get female plants and

264
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:08,519
probably the Herm present is less than

265
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:12,299
if it's a good project less than one or

266
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:15,539
two percent you know you pop uh ipok for

267
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:19,139
example my last run 33 seeds I didn't

268
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:22,319
have any harm and then I pop another 72

269
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:26,338
seeds and I have just two herbs so the

270
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,860
Herm percentage can vary uh from

271
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:31,320
cultivar to cultivar from genetic to

272
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:35,100
genetic you know how well the genetics

273
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,440
are combining themselves so either way I

274
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,659
consider feminizing seeds if you if you

275
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,079
try to grow female plants a more

276
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:45,419
Advantage where to go than regular seeds

277
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:47,159
got it and then kind of taking a step

278
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:49,740
back there's a lot of folks that are

279
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:51,659
just getting started with breeding you

280
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,299
know and they they're kind of limited on

281
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:57,059
the space that they have what would you

282
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:59,578
say is the smallest size grow space that

283
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:01,919
someone can do this type of breeding in

284
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:04,319
I mean you can do these types of

285
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:07,679
breeding in any kind of space even if

286
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,860
you have like a two by two tent or

287
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:14,219
whatever you have you get uh you get

288
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,320
your plan that you want to reverse and

289
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,720
you start spraying it with the reversal

290
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,440
spray and you need to have another plant

291
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,379
so the smallest project that you can get

292
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,899
done is just bring two plants you get

293
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:31,200
one plant that you reverse and a plant

294
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:34,620
that you will uh pollinate with so it

295
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:38,399
can be a two by four space even a uh

296
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:41,820
yeah two by four two feet two plants or

297
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,559
a two by two you can get this done in

298
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:48,120
any kind of space you don't need a lot

299
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:50,518
of space and if you do this right from

300
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,620
one plant you can get like thousands of

301
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,980
seeds so you don't need a lot of space

302
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:58,440
you need the minimum possible space that

303
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,079
you can grow two plants in it you know

304
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,880
okay and then it's far as tools and

305
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:04,739
equipment so I think a lot of folks that

306
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,600
are getting into breeding they already

307
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,339
know how to grow the plant regularly I

308
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,139
think a majority of them you know maybe

309
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,639
99 of people already know how to grow

310
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,959
the plant or at least they should know

311
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,159
how to grow the plant and they're just

312
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,979
getting into breeding are there any

313
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:19,980
other like separate tools and equipment

314
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:23,940
that they would need in order to breed

315
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:26,278
there is no apps like different tools or

316
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:30,480
things that you need in order to breed

317
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:33,659
all you need to do it is to to grow the

318
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,519
plants healthy and you just need to have

319
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:38,399
your reversal

320
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,399
um plan in place you know you need to

321
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,339
have the timing right and you need to

322
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:48,000
have to know how to grow super healthy

323
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:51,360
plants because uh my point of in my in

324
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,600
my breathing my main point is the

325
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,778
healthcare you keep the plants the

326
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:01,620
better you will you the better the the

327
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:03,659
genetics will will inter like will mix

328
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,480
with each other you know you need to

329
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:09,419
it's like humans when you try to when

330
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,420
you when humans try to make kids the

331
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:14,759
healthier the parents are the healthier

332
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:17,159
will transmit into the into the children

333
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:20,159
so that's what I'm trying to do with the

334
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:24,480
with the plants keep them as healthy as

335
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:27,719
possible uh during before and during the

336
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:31,139
breeding process so the offsprings the

337
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,839
seeds will be super healthy uh seeds

338
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:37,139
with the best genetics possible you know

339
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,600
that's so that's that's what's all come

340
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:41,820
come too so what would actually happen

341
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,680
if the plant did have like deficiencies

342
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,879
like say the plant was yellowing or

343
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:46,859
something like that towards the lower

344
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,198
part of the plant and it was pretty

345
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,180
minor and they went and they did they

346
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,078
started that reversal process with the

347
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:54,479
spray

348
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,039
is there like what are the downsides to

349
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,180
doing that versus starting with a

350
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,099
healthy plan I mean you got to mention

351
00:15:57,179 --> 00:16:01,739
that the the health would go down to The

352
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,620
Offspring right but uh are they going to

353
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:07,799
see any issues during the reversal

354
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:10,740
process I don't know exactly what to

355
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:13,159
tell them from now because uh they uh

356
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:16,680
there can happen a lot of things but

357
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:19,980
from my point of view you know when you

358
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:24,120
have mineral deficiencies in humans like

359
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:27,199
folic acid in a pregnant woman or a

360
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,879
Calcium deficiency in a pregnant woman

361
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:32,939
that will transmit into the kids you

362
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:35,159
know you have folic acid deficiency uh

363
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:38,100
the the kid can be born with birth

364
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,600
defects with uh Channel I don't know

365
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,199
exactly how it's called birth General

366
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:46,199
defect or if the mother have vitamin D

367
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:49,319
or calcium deficiencies the the the kid

368
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:51,659
can have different like bone uh mineral

369
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:55,940
deficiencies and like different you know

370
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:59,419
different uh problems later on life and

371
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:03,420
being into the bodybuilding and health

372
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:05,578
health side of the things with humans I

373
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:08,459
translate that into my plants as well

374
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:11,639
because it's kind of the same process so

375
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:14,699
I cannot tell exactly what will happen

376
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:18,419
but I can say that the healthier you

377
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:21,779
keep your plants the better you'll the

378
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:23,459
better genetics you can create uh on

379
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:26,399
your seeds you know the healthcare

380
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:28,380
genetic you can transmit into the seeds

381
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,780
Okay so if the plant were to have

382
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,900
deficiencies during that reversal

383
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:36,119
process like you mentioned would there

384
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,820
be potential mutant plants that happen

385
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:41,459
or like uh crazy characteristics that

386
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:44,399
come out of The Offspring because of the

387
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,298
uh it's very it's very possible to have

388
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,500
like

389
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:53,940
um mutant plants or I would say more

390
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:56,759
likely to have more harm her problems

391
00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:01,320
later on because the DNA of the plants

392
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:03,960
didn't mix and uh stain the right the

393
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:07,319
place that it's supposed to you know so

394
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:12,779
it can be more like a more harm chances

395
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:16,500
or more mutant plants or uh seeds not

396
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:18,960
germinating correctly later on so there

397
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:22,558
can be a lot of problems but I cannot

398
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,919
point exactly because uh the science is

399
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:28,500
not yet there yet on the plants what

400
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:32,160
will happen if uh this plant will have

401
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:34,679
magnesium deficiency or so on but what I

402
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,900
can say for sure is that the healthier

403
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:40,200
you can keep your plants during the

404
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,880
breeding projects the better you are uh

405
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,980
you are off with your with your

406
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,799
Offspring with your seeds and genetics

407
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:50,220
later on you know all right and then as

408
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,779
far as the seed to use to begin a lot of

409
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,339
people say that regular seeds is the

410
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:55,918
only thing you should use and that you

411
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:58,558
should not use feminized seeds for

412
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,440
breeding are there any risks with

413
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:04,079
starting with a feminized seed and using

414
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,038
that reversing that versus a regular

415
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:11,399
seed okay first of all uh I don't like

416
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:14,759
to start with uh with uh with seeds you

417
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:17,400
know with seed plants I start directly

418
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:21,240
with the genetics that are very very

419
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:23,460
well well known uh very well the

420
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,460
characteristics are that I'm looking for

421
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,419
you know I'm starting with with genetics

422
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,558
that

423
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:33,660
already good you know they are selected

424
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:36,480
they are breeder Cuts they are cuts that

425
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,640
are very valuable because

426
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,940
the whole

427
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,120
the whole thing boils down to the

428
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:48,840
genetics what genetics you can bring to

429
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:51,959
make a even better genetic right and

430
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:54,839
when you start from seed you have a huge

431
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,419
variation that you can you you can you

432
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:59,939
can pop a hundred seeds and you cannot

433
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:02,759
find one good plant on a hundred says

434
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:06,000
you know so that's that's the thing I

435
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:09,900
never start with uh with seed plants I

436
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,859
always start with clones that are tested

437
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,880
that are very well known that are very

438
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:17,279
very

439
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,280
um valuable you know they have the

440
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:23,579
characteristics that I'm looking for the

441
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:27,298
the THC the the medicinal properties

442
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:29,579
that I'm looking for the the color that

443
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:31,798
I'm looking for the Vigor that I'm

444
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:34,798
looking for you know so I never start

445
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:36,000
with seeds I'm starting with uh with the

446
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:39,480
Clones

447
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,960
and I'm trying to get the best genetics

448
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:46,259
that I have access to so anybody can

449
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,720
they can breathe but the main thing is

450
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:52,140
what genetics you start with you know

451
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,720
because not everybody have access to the

452
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,960
best genetics in the world so that's

453
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,940
that's that's one of my main focus

454
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,579
finding the best genetics and hunting

455
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:05,400
the seeds that I'm creating to find the

456
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:07,859
best genetics that I can bring into my

457
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,600
other other genetics you know so you

458
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:13,740
don't really worry about if that clone

459
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:16,259
came from a seed that was regular or if

460
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,359
that clone came from a plant that was

461
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:20,220
feminized started from a feminine as

462
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,199
long as that clone as long as you know

463
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,000
that the mother plant was a healthy

464
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,400
plant produce what you were looking for

465
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,900
within the genetics you'll use that

466
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,080
clone you'll grow it out and then you'll

467
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:33,960
reverse it exactly exactly I don't care

468
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:36,779
if it came from a feminazi seeds or a

469
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:40,558
regular seeds all I can is to be stable

470
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:43,558
to have a lot of value to bring a lot of

471
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:47,879
value to my breeding project you know uh

472
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:53,639
yield uh collar medicinal properties uh

473
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:56,700
uh the plant structure uh figure in

474
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,320
flower in veg and all those things you

475
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,200
know I don't care if it's come from

476
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:03,720
feminized or regular seeds all right and

477
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,038
then getting into the characteristics it

478
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,679
really depends on the breeder what the

479
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:10,740
breeder is looking for in the plant what

480
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:14,159
do you look for within a female plant to

481
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:17,038
use for breeding uh first of all I'm

482
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:20,760
looking like I said for that high value

483
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,319
uh genetics that has

484
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:25,259
um

485
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:27,839
what people are looking at the moment in

486
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:30,240
the market you know and people right now

487
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:33,178
in the marketing are looking talking for

488
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:37,019
high medicinal properties like high

489
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:39,080
percentage of medicinal properties THC

490
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:42,599
CBD and so forth

491
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:45,779
also people are looking for very good

492
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:50,058
bag appeal so color again it's a very

493
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:54,298
important thing uh purple uh color plant

494
00:22:50,058 --> 00:22:57,379
will be more appealing than a green uh

495
00:22:54,298 --> 00:23:01,558
green plant also I'm looking for

496
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:04,880
Frost the whole Frosty and how good the

497
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:10,019
bad look the structure of the bud

498
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:12,900
how how well the plant grow in veg how

499
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:16,319
much the plant yields and so forth you

500
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:18,960
know and also there are terpenes that

501
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:22,500
our people are looking for some people

502
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:25,200
are looking more for uh sweet candy

503
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:30,419
turbs and some people are looking more

504
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:32,580
for gas and OG kind of uh trains so it

505
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:35,940
all depends what what you're looking for

506
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:38,639
and there are different customers that

507
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:42,240
are looking for different things so I'm

508
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,059
trying to breed for everybody to have

509
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,859
something good for everybody you know

510
00:23:44,058 --> 00:23:49,259
understood yeah it's so subjective and

511
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:51,599
uh yeah it really depends on and again

512
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:54,119
with the breeder or the the Breeders

513
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:56,099
customers are looking for so yeah I

514
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:58,079
appreciate you explaining that one so

515
00:23:56,099 --> 00:24:00,658
let's get into the actual reversal

516
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,619
process using the sprays so there are a

517
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,440
couple different ways you can go about

518
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:07,439
it right there is colonosova there is

519
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:10,679
silver Theo sulfate for short STS

520
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,538
there's also gibberic acid and I know

521
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:14,580
you said you don't have experience with

522
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:16,919
the gibberic acid so we won't talk about

523
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:18,779
that but I believe you have experience

524
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:22,740
with those dsts and the colloidal silver

525
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:24,839
yeah so let's start with STS walk us

526
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:28,200
through the process how do you go about

527
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:31,439
doing the sprays when do you spray how

528
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,179
do you spray so on and so forth so the

529
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,120
only thing that I've used on my plants

530
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:40,320
is the SDS spray the abbreviation for uh

531
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:43,319
for the SDS spray so basically that come

532
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:46,500
in two bought two two bottles that you

533
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:49,460
need to mix up and create a spray that

534
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:53,339
you'll spray your plant your your your

535
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:58,079
reversal plant for three weeks for the

536
00:24:53,339 --> 00:25:00,599
first three weeks of flour so uh you

537
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:03,720
take your reversal plant you put it on

538
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:07,199
flour you put it on a 12 12 schedule

539
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:10,798
light schedule and right away you start

540
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,500
the process of spraying the plant you

541
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:16,918
can uh usually I spread between one and

542
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:21,058
two times a day for the first 15 to 20

543
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:24,020
days of flour and in 20 uh in a 15 to 20

544
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:27,720
days you should start seeing instead of

545
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:29,038
flour you should start see pollen sacks

546
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,140
forming

547
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:34,259
so that's when you know that the

548
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:37,140
reversal process was successful you

549
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:39,900
start seeing pollen sex you have started

550
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:42,480
seeing a male plant instead of a female

551
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:46,860
plant with flower plants

552
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:50,099
the main thing and what I've done wrong

553
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:53,278
in the past and I want to uh mention

554
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:55,980
right here it's the timing so

555
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:59,339
um I start my breeding projects a year

556
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:02,640
ago putting the reverse the plant that I

557
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:05,099
refers and all the other plants that I'm

558
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,620
trying to pollinate putting them into

559
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:09,418
flour in the same time

560
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:13,379
and uh

561
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:17,159
by the time that my plant was reversing

562
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:19,860
was a little bit too late in flower for

563
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:24,059
my for my flower plants to be pollinated

564
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:26,519
and create seeds so I want to mention

565
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:29,519
that the plant that you want to reverse

566
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:33,058
you need to put it in flour and start

567
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:35,519
spraying it uh at least two weeks

568
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:38,819
between two to three weeks

569
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:41,579
uh before you put all your flower plants

570
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:45,778
that you try to pollinate them so I

571
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:49,079
started reversing my plans uh today for

572
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:51,599
the next two weeks and then I start my

573
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:54,839
other female plants that I'm trying to

574
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:58,379
mix with this male plant reversal plant

575
00:26:54,839 --> 00:27:02,099
into flour and then I put them all in

576
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:06,059
the same tent and I'm kind of doing a

577
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:08,699
open pollination I put the reversal

578
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:11,460
plant in a corner of the tent and I'm

579
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:14,400
putting a fan blowing right on that

580
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:17,100
plant and when the time it's gone the

581
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:21,059
pawn sacks will open and the pollen will

582
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:23,639
go in the whole tent I'm also taking the

583
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:27,178
plant I'm trying to keep my reversal

584
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:29,880
plant in a smaller kind of pot because I

585
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:33,480
want to be able to take that plant and

586
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,278
shake it above the other plants when I'm

587
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,720
seeing a lot of pollen on the plant

588
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,659
because

589
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,120
just by having a flan blowing on the

590
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:44,640
plant sometimes is not enough you have

591
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:47,038
to actually when the time it come take

592
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,500
the plant and shake it above the other

593
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:53,759
plants so all the pollen will go on the

594
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:56,759
plants so by doing this a link two to

595
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:59,278
three weeks for the reversal plan to

596
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:02,640
start reversing you get the perfect

597
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:06,240
timing for the for the for the other

598
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:09,600
plants to flower and be ready to get the

599
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,720
pollen you know and uh that's how I got

600
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:15,899
the best results and the most seeds

601
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,480
because when I was putting the reversal

602
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:21,120
plant with the with the other flowering

603
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,298
plants the the female plants in the same

604
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:27,319
time in flower was not enough time to

605
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:30,599
pollinate and have the seeds made

606
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:32,099
matcher and be ready to harvest in time

607
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:35,178
you know

608
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:38,459
so that's basically the whole process

609
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:41,820
you just take your reversal plant you

610
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:44,880
spread for three weeks you bring you you

611
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:47,579
start the flowering process two weeks

612
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,278
later on the flowering plants and you

613
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:52,319
just pollinate that other plants the

614
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:55,859
most important thing on a breeding

615
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:58,740
project like I said is the genetics that

616
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:02,038
you breed with and the health of the

617
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:05,400
plants because as in humans

618
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:06,960
if you're trying to obtain if if you're

619
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:11,038
a kid you'll try to have your kid

620
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,620
playing NBA and you are a five five and

621
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:16,619
your wife it's a five five uh tall

622
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:19,859
person you don't have the genetics to

623
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:22,619
have your kid playing in NBA whatever

624
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:27,058
you do you know what I mean so genetics

625
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:30,000
are the the main part of this breeding

626
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:33,119
game you know finding the right genetics

627
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,859
to Bro to breed and then the health of

628
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,119
the plant all right so let me just make

629
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:37,678
sure I understand this correctly because

630
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:40,019
I've never done I've never created

631
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,960
feminine scenes before I do have my own

632
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:45,298
cross Brisco G cross with Pakistan

633
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,919
Valley but I'm doing inbreeding so I've

634
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:48,418
actually done eat inbreeding all the way

635
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:50,580
down to an F3

636
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:52,799
creating feminized seeds is a different

637
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:55,199
process so let me make sure I understand

638
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,240
what you had just mentioned there which

639
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,580
is the plant that you're going to spray

640
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,798
you'll flip to a 12 12 light cycle

641
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:04,259
flowering light cycle you'll spray the

642
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:07,619
plant for the first 14 days you'll

643
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:12,000
you'll apply that spray once more more

644
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:14,759
likely like 20 days 20 20 days 15 to 20

645
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,159
days but at the 14 day Mark that's when

646
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:19,558
you're taking your other plant from Veg

647
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:22,140
and putting it into flour exactly

648
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:24,599
exactly okay and so then that plant is

649
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:27,659
going to start to flower and you're

650
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:30,719
continuing to spray that other plant up

651
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:33,179
to the 20 day or 21 day Mark right yes

652
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,919
and then at that point the plant has

653
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:37,080
created pollen sacs or it's starting to

654
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:39,120
create pollen sacs and then the timing

655
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:40,859
should match up to where the plant that

656
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,898
you're going to pollinate is ready for

657
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:46,019
pollination and the plant that you've

658
00:30:42,898 --> 00:30:48,359
sprayed is releasing pollen and then you

659
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:50,940
take the plant that is releasing pollen

660
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:53,639
and you're actually you know letting the

661
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,720
oscillating fan blow pollen in to the

662
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,640
environment you're doing the open

663
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,860
pollination you're even taking the plant

664
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,360
grabbing it up and shaking it over the

665
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:02,879
other plant I've done the same thing on

666
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,199
the last run I did pollination uh pick

667
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,000
up the plant I had a two gallon

668
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,319
container is what I was in and shaking

669
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,839
it over there the plant to make sure

670
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:11,759
it's really well pollinated is that

671
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:13,918
pretty much what you had just mentioned

672
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,500
did I explained that correctly yes

673
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,960
that's that's pretty much what I was

674
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,538
mentioned uh I also want to mention that

675
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,360
when you spray your plant when you put

676
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:27,119
the plant that you reverse you don't

677
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:29,699
spread into the tent with the other

678
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:32,158
female plants because you run the risk

679
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,500
of spraying on the other plants and

680
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,799
reversing the other plants so I take my

681
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:40,679
plant and I spread separately from the

682
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:42,898
other plants and um when the plant is

683
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:48,298
all dry I put it back into the tent

684
00:31:42,898 --> 00:31:52,739
another thing uh these STD STS

685
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:53,579
this SDS spray it's a very very

686
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,319
um

687
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:57,019
it's very

688
00:31:55,319 --> 00:32:00,298
um how cold

689
00:31:57,019 --> 00:32:03,960
very sensitive to the light and

690
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:06,720
temperature so when you spray your plant

691
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,298
make sure you are not spraying it with

692
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,339
the lights on and in a very hot

693
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:13,619
environment you know I like to take my

694
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:17,038
plant that I reversed

695
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:20,579
let it sit outside of the tent or need a

696
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:23,038
bathtub for 10-15 minutes I spread then

697
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:25,259
I let it see to dry it up for 10-15

698
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,480
minutes and then I put it back into the

699
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:29,099
tent are you spraying just once a day

700
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:32,640
are you spraying multiple times a day

701
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:35,219
once a day usually but sometimes I'm

702
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:38,820
doing twice a day like especially at the

703
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:41,159
beginning or to make sure that the plant

704
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:43,918
is well spread and will reverse

705
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,080
correctly also I want to mention that

706
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:50,399
you better have

707
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:52,439
multiple plants reversing than just one

708
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:54,418
based on your space that you're

709
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,659
breathing for example I I like to

710
00:32:54,419 --> 00:33:01,080
breathe in five by five tens and I like

711
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:04,320
to have at least two plants that I

712
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:05,579
reverse same genetic but two plants that

713
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:09,178
I reverse

714
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:12,599
so I make sure that I have enough pollen

715
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:15,059
to pollinate the whole damn because it

716
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:17,939
you don't want to get to the point where

717
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:20,940
you reverse only one plant and you don't

718
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,679
have enough pollen to pollinate all your

719
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:26,600
other plants you better have extra

720
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:28,980
pollen or more pollen than not enough

721
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:32,219
another thing that I'm encouraging

722
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:35,759
encouraging people is like I said that

723
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:39,000
time time frame of two weeks you can

724
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:41,879
take one of the plants and do it to

725
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,159
start reversing it two weeks before but

726
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,740
you can have your other plans start

727
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,200
reversing three weeks before or you can

728
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:52,019
have three plants like one week before

729
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,000
the you put other in flour two weeks

730
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:58,380
before and three weeks so you make

731
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,500
because different uh genetics reverse

732
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:05,720
different and release pollen in

733
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:08,519
different times so you are if you never

734
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:11,179
reverse that plan before you don't know

735
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:14,519
exactly when the pollen sacks will open

736
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:17,519
for sure and how much Poland they will

737
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:21,239
produce so you better have more pollen

738
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:23,398
and more chances to to to pollinate all

739
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,500
your famous uh other plants than less

740
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:27,779
you know all right and then that plant

741
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,780
that you are reversing on the plants

742
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:33,780
that you are reversing how big are you

743
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,580
growing them generally and you mentioned

744
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,679
you like to for them to be in smaller

745
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:42,539
containers what size containers

746
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:46,260
uh I usually like uh if I do uh in one

747
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:50,519
gallon Parts I do one gallon pot cocoa

748
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:54,119
or I do uh the big I think they're

749
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:57,480
called Big Mama or whatever the eight by

750
00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:00,720
eight uh broccol cubes

751
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:03,420
so even I do in the big rockle cubes or

752
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:07,199
one gallon pots and when I'm trying to

753
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:10,200
pollinate I get a nice dry back so the

754
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:13,019
plant is super light and I just go and

755
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:13,858
uh shake it over the other plants

756
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:17,759
um

757
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:21,179
the plant I like to be at least like two

758
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,339
feet tall I I don't like huge plants

759
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:25,980
because when you have huge plants they

760
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:28,199
cannot sustain themselves anymore and

761
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:31,019
you get like like the buds will get

762
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:34,500
heavy and you they'll flop over I prefer

763
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:36,960
to have few different plants but smaller

764
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:40,139
ones that I can work better with you

765
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,900
know if I have uh two plants and are two

766
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:45,299
or three feet tall uh it's a lot easier

767
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,400
for me to pollinate the other plants

768
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:50,339
when the time come what do you use for a

769
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:54,180
fertilizer uh for fertilizer I use

770
00:35:50,338 --> 00:35:56,940
Athena AG nutrients it's a salt based

771
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:59,879
nutrients and uh

772
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:04,019
a lot of people ask me but Organics are

773
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:09,838
not better soil is not better uh and my

774
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:12,539
my answer is uh always do where you can

775
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:15,659
keep your plants the healthiest possible

776
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:19,079
if you can if you have your plants super

777
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:21,838
healthy in soil do it in soil but if you

778
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:24,060
never use soil or anything or whatever

779
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:26,400
works for you whatever can keep your

780
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:28,078
plants the healthy as possible that's

781
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,579
what you need to use it doesn't matter

782
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:34,800
if it's uh if it's organic or synthetic

783
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:37,019
nutrients because will give the same

784
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,480
input to the plants or will give the

785
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:42,059
same nutrients the the synthetic

786
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,240
nutrients the salt nutrients will give

787
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:48,779
the direct input the organic need to be

788
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:51,598
break down by uh organic matters and

789
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:54,300
give to the plants so for me organic is

790
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,000
a little bit more complicated than soil

791
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:59,579
it's a little bit more complicated and I

792
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,280
believe it's a whole science how you can

793
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:05,480
keep your plants healthy and create a

794
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:08,519
nice uh uh

795
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:12,539
microbiome into the medium that can feed

796
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:15,000
your plant and the salt nutrients are a

797
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:17,940
lot easier to control and keep your

798
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,099
plants healthy so my choice is uh salt

799
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:23,220
nutrients because I can control

800
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:26,338
everything to a tea I can control the AC

801
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:27,959
I can control the pH exactly where I

802
00:37:26,338 --> 00:37:30,119
want to be and I can keep my plants

803
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,639
super happy and healthy healthy

804
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:34,680
understood okay so you've got your

805
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:36,900
plants growing you've reversed a plant

806
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:38,578
you also brought your other plant in

807
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,160
that you're going to pollinate you've

808
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:43,079
done the pollination process what

809
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:45,179
happens to the reverse plant after that

810
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:46,980
are you collecting pollen at all or are

811
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,539
you just killing off that plant that you

812
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:52,679
reverse because you no longer need it

813
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:55,099
usually usually reverse it plants are

814
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:58,858
not producing

815
00:37:55,099 --> 00:38:03,420
as much Poland like a real male plant

816
00:37:58,858 --> 00:38:05,819
you know so usually it's not much Fallen

817
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:09,119
left after I pollinate the plants I

818
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:11,820
think the plants so hard that is no

819
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:14,039
pollen left into the plant by the time

820
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,838
it's finished so usually I don't make

821
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:18,239
sense I don't have nothing to collect I

822
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:20,759
just throw them away and it's an easy

823
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:22,919
process I can do it anytime I can take a

824
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,140
plant and reverse it take only three

825
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,200
weeks so no makes sense to keep it

826
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:31,139
around I just got it and uh I spread out

827
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:34,879
the other plants into the tent and I

828
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:37,799
continued the the breeding the seed

829
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:41,400
maturation of the plants you know so the

830
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,260
seeds are forming in the plants Buds and

831
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,358
uh I guess my next question would be how

832
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:48,480
long is that plant growing like how long

833
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:50,940
should the female plant grow and then be

834
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,099
harvested in order to maximize the yield

835
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,780
of seeds right because I imagine that if

836
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:57,838
you're harvesting too early you have a

837
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,519
lot of immature seeds do you just let

838
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:01,259
your plants grow and grow and grow and

839
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,358
grow until they're basically dead and

840
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:07,859
then Harvest or what's your process for

841
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:13,199
harvesting so uh usually my process is I

842
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:16,500
let my plants go as much as they want so

843
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:18,659
I watch my plants I don't even count how

844
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,539
many weeks I cannot tell you I do like

845
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:24,480
after I pollinate another five or six

846
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:29,820
weeks but usually it's a little longer

847
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:32,880
process than flowering plants for um

848
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:35,099
for bad you know for medicine for

849
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,338
medicine it's a little bit like probably

850
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:41,940
like uh a week to two weeks longer

851
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:44,940
process so I like to take my time and

852
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,500
watch the plants uh uh how deep it form

853
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:49,019
but

854
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:51,659
um definitely I don't like to see my

855
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:54,000
plants Dead all the way dead I'm

856
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:58,319
harvesting my plants and I like to see

857
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,119
my plants still green and vibrant so I

858
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,338
don't do any kind of flushing or

859
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:07,320
anything I like to keep my plants

860
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:10,519
healthy as long as I can and um

861
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:13,380
what I usually do I take a small bod

862
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:16,440
towards the end and I check the seeds

863
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:19,019
and see uh if the seeds are mature

864
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,559
enough or I need to let them go but like

865
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:25,619
I said leave them a longer longer it's

866
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:28,619
better than cut them short so let them

867
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:31,680
go for as long as they need check like

868
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:34,740
Bots for for to see how the seeds are

869
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:38,940
inside if they are still green give them

870
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:41,939
another week or so don't rush them and

871
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:44,539
um and that's how how you do it

872
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:47,820
um you need to learn to read your plans

873
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:50,759
and know when to take them down

874
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:53,579
but like I said it's a little longer

875
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:56,280
like usually two weeks longer uh if you

876
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:58,619
cut your plant like your your female

877
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,339
plant that you use for breeding if you

878
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:05,820
in if you cut it in flour for medicine

879
00:41:01,338 --> 00:41:09,358
uh at the day at week eight or nine let

880
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:12,480
the the seeded plant go for 10 or 11

881
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:14,639
weeks you know because you want May uh

882
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,858
match your seeds inside the pot you

883
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:20,159
don't want green seeds you want all the

884
00:41:16,858 --> 00:41:22,500
way matter seeds so you get the best

885
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:25,199
germination rate possible that makes

886
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:28,739
sense so when you do harvest the plant

887
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:30,719
the process of breaking up the buds and

888
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:31,979
kind of sorting out the seeds what do

889
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:33,719
you do for that are you just like

890
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,579
breaking it up by hand and then putting

891
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:39,299
it into like a seed cleaning machine or

892
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:42,180
what uh I do everything by hand so I

893
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:45,000
have a dream Bean where I break down or

894
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:47,759
I put all my seeded Bots and I start

895
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,300
breaking in down like into like like

896
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,700
like very fine material and seeds all

897
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:58,440
mixed together and then it's a process

898
00:41:53,699 --> 00:42:01,078
of shaking that that dream Bean where it

899
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,960
separates the seeds from all the the

900
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:07,260
green material you know and you then

901
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:09,000
take it by hand and you whatever however

902
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:11,880
you want to do it

903
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,358
um like I said I'm at the beginning of

904
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:19,079
my my road and I'm not doing like huge

905
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:21,480
breathing projects where I need uh uh

906
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:24,839
separating machines or anything like

907
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:28,199
that my process is all handmade I take

908
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:30,838
the seeds by hand I pack them by hand I

909
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:31,939
do everything by hand for the moment all

910
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:34,858
by myself

911
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:37,500
uh and pretty much that's it so

912
00:42:34,858 --> 00:42:40,019
everybody need to find their own methods

913
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:43,440
that work for them definitely it's a

914
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:48,300
very meticulous process taking all those

915
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:51,539
seeds uh by hand but uh it's all worth

916
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:54,180
it I in my opinion got it I do want to

917
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:55,980
go back to hermaphrodites so we talked

918
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:57,239
about a little bit earlier in the

919
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,760
episode but I want to get a little bit

920
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:01,919
deeper into it what do we need to know

921
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,839
about hermaphrodites I hear horror story

922
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,760
after horror story after Horror Story

923
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:07,799
that people are getting feminized seeds

924
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,359
they're planting them and they're

925
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,680
getting a whole bunch of hermaphrodites

926
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:12,119
so what do we need to know about

927
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:13,919
hermaphrodites you know what are the

928
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:16,920
chances they occur and how do you avoid

929
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:21,720
getting hermaphrodites so hermaphrodites

930
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:25,460
are uh plants that are female plants but

931
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:28,439
uh they start developing also male

932
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:32,400
characteristics so they start so they

933
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:35,760
are 99 female plants with uh with

934
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,160
flowers but they got uh pollen sacks few

935
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,099
pollen sacks and usually those falling

936
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,539
sacks come at the bottom of the of the

937
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:44,039
plant

938
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:47,599
um

939
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:50,940
with all the feminized seeds

940
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:55,740
especially if they are first generation

941
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:57,420
so you take uh uh so on uh genetic and

942
00:43:55,739 --> 00:44:00,239
you bring that to a different genetic

943
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:03,180
for the first time the chances of

944
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:06,479
hermaphrodites are a little bit higher

945
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:09,419
and there are chances of hermaphrodites

946
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,900
for sure but I think the main factor

947
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:14,519
with hermaphrodites is the way you treat

948
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,220
your plants

949
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:19,318
when when you grow them like the

950
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:22,858
environment uh where you keep your

951
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:24,838
plants in the light schedule and how you

952
00:44:22,858 --> 00:44:26,098
stress them because

953
00:44:24,838 --> 00:44:30,059
um

954
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:34,019
I I pop a ton of seeds from different

955
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:37,380
people my own seeds and I don't have a

956
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:40,380
bunch of of hermaphrodites because my

957
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:42,539
environment is on point it's it's uh

958
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:44,338
it's what it's supposed to be and I

959
00:44:42,539 --> 00:44:46,699
don't stress the plants in the first

960
00:44:44,338 --> 00:44:49,139
three for the weeks of flour because

961
00:44:46,699 --> 00:44:50,699
feminizing seeds get very easily

962
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:53,818
stressed in the first three weeks of

963
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:57,179
flour and the plant will be like oh I

964
00:44:53,818 --> 00:45:00,119
need to survive and put my generation go

965
00:44:57,179 --> 00:45:03,118
prepare to my generation so I pop a

966
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:06,000
pollen sack so I can pollinate the plant

967
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:08,700
and create seeds so I can reproduce you

968
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,679
know that's when a harsh environment you

969
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:12,659
have a harsh environment you know but

970
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:15,960
when you have a nice good environment

971
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:18,358
where the plants are thriving and they

972
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:21,000
are super healthy they don't really have

973
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:23,159
much reason to hermaphrodite you know

974
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,940
what I mean they don't have they don't

975
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:29,399
have a reason to hermaphrodite as if

976
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:32,519
they are stressed out so the main thing

977
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,559
with the hermaphrodites is keep your

978
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:37,039
plants

979
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:40,199
keep your plants as healthy as possible

980
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:43,318
bug free because bugs can stress the

981
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:46,559
plants as well feed them correctly don't

982
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:49,199
over feed them don't give them a ton of

983
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:51,779
light the the usual mistakes that I see

984
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:53,419
people doing it's too much light too

985
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:57,060
much nutrients

986
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:58,440
keeping the plants too wet you know uh

987
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:01,219
and um

988
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:04,460
that's that's how you get hermaphrodites

989
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:07,259
and uh like I said the the

990
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:09,659
hermaphrodites can happen even with a

991
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:12,780
good environment because it's the

992
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:16,440
genetic that cannot be sometimes is not

993
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:18,859
stable you know but uh that's that's

994
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,780
that's what it come about it's uh

995
00:46:18,858 --> 00:46:25,380
hermaphrodites happen because the plant

996
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:28,380
want to procreate and continue her genes

997
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:30,240
uh in a stress environment you know but

998
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:33,420
if you don't give a reason for the plant

999
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:35,459
to think that will die and she's all

1000
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:38,220
thriving and healthy she don't really

1001
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:40,019
have a reason to hermaphrodite on you I

1002
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:42,959
feel like there's a way that you can

1003
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:45,358
avoid getting hermaphrodites as if the

1004
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,280
breeder actually does testing or sends

1005
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:49,440
their seeds out to be tested first

1006
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,060
that's a common practice is people will

1007
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,679
take The Offspring and then they'll send

1008
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:55,440
them out to a group of people whether

1009
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:56,759
that be 5 10 15 people and have them

1010
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,380
grow it out and see if there are

1011
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,780
hermaphrodites or not then if every

1012
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,880
things all well off of that batch of

1013
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:04,740
seeds that they've gotten tested then

1014
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,420
they distribute it to the community in

1015
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:08,279
your opinion how many people should test

1016
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:11,639
the genetics before releasing them to

1017
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:14,519
the public it's all it's all based on

1018
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:17,159
how big of the of the breeding is if you

1019
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:19,199
have just a small tent you cannot send

1020
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:21,719
to a thousand people you know your your

1021
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:25,259
seeds because you'll have no more seeds

1022
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:29,519
you know but uh I like personally to

1023
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:31,380
test my genetics so I pop all my all the

1024
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:36,059
seeds that I create before I release

1025
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:39,059
them I I I I germinate them first to see

1026
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:41,639
the germination rate and also I like to

1027
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:43,920
hunt my own seeds and find my own

1028
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:46,440
Keepers because that's the main reason

1029
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:49,019
why I'm I'm breeding first of all to

1030
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:53,940
find my own genetics that I can later on

1031
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:56,940
bridge with so first of all I I'm the

1032
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:59,639
one to to do all the testing I'm the one

1033
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:02,760
who do the the German Financial red test

1034
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:05,159
and I'm the one who grow

1035
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:07,859
the plants first

1036
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:09,118
and then I got a couple of friends that

1037
00:48:07,858 --> 00:48:11,639
I trust

1038
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,800
they can give me feedback and I give

1039
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:16,618
them seeds and hey bro can you pop those

1040
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:19,140
seeds for me and give me feedback but

1041
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:22,559
like I said the number of people that

1042
00:48:19,139 --> 00:48:25,379
you give your seeds it's based on the

1043
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:28,858
how big your your project is you know

1044
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:30,599
how big your project is but uh like I

1045
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:33,659
said I like to be the first one who

1046
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:37,019
tells them and I have few people but uh

1047
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:38,279
yeah that's how how it goes I mean that

1048
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:40,440
makes sense you don't want to you know

1049
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,420
if your yield of seeds is 500 for

1050
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,818
example you don't want to send out 10

1051
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,980
packs to 20 people and also there's 200

1052
00:48:44,818 --> 00:48:48,838
seeds gone you know more almost half of

1053
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:51,719
your seeds are gone so I get what you

1054
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:54,179
mean by as far as scale and also also

1055
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:56,279
also it's very important to who you give

1056
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:59,159
your seeds to because you need to be

1057
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:01,500
very very trustful people that have very

1058
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:04,318
good growing skills because if you give

1059
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:07,079
to people that are not have the right

1060
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:09,779
growing skills they cannot give you the

1061
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:11,519
right feedback they will pop your seeds

1062
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,859
and they'll not germinate because they

1063
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:15,838
don't know how to germinate or they will

1064
00:49:13,858 --> 00:49:18,598
harm because they don't have the right

1065
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:21,539
environment you know what I mean so I

1066
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:24,059
like to keep my circle uh tight of the

1067
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:27,779
people that I've trust and give my

1068
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:30,358
sister to try and get the real feedback

1069
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:33,480
from them but the main test that has

1070
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:36,719
right now because like I said I'm not a

1071
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:40,519
big uh breeder I'm not considered that

1072
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:45,118
is even myself a breather yet

1073
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:49,259
it's it's me that's like if it if the

1074
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:52,079
seeds uh cross my standards then they

1075
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:54,540
are good to go for other people as well

1076
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:57,839
you know to send to other people so I

1077
00:49:54,539 --> 00:50:00,239
have very high standards and uh I like

1078
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:03,500
to try the seeds to grow them myself

1079
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:05,879
before before I send it to other people

1080
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:08,119
understood so after you've completed

1081
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,500
that run you've harvested the plants

1082
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:11,700
cleaning I want to get into that a

1083
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,380
little bit it's a common question that

1084
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:15,779
people have because this this pollen

1085
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:18,720
still within the tent right so what do

1086
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:20,940
you do for cleaning between runs to

1087
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:24,779
ensure that the pollen from the previous

1088
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:27,179
run is completely gone so uh I do the

1089
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:30,180
same thing with all my growth is nothing

1090
00:50:27,179 --> 00:50:33,358
specific that I'm doing with uh with uh

1091
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:36,299
with the breathing tents but I got a

1092
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:38,759
bottle uh like not like a spray bottle

1093
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:42,359
it's like a it's like a container like a

1094
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:46,260
two gallon container spray like electric

1095
00:50:42,358 --> 00:50:50,039
spray with battery and I mix

1096
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:53,640
um I mix Chlor like chlorine from

1097
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:57,599
Walmart I get the Chlor with water and I

1098
00:50:53,639 --> 00:51:00,838
mix like 10 20 Chlor and rest water and

1099
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:03,599
I spray the whole tent everything I

1100
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:06,058
spray everything with Chlor and then I I

1101
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,818
get my gloves on and I get

1102
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:11,220
um the paper towels and I wipe out

1103
00:51:08,818 --> 00:51:15,300
everything in the tent

1104
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:18,239
so simple and basic uh cleaning you know

1105
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,619
pretty straightforward there yes so

1106
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:21,058
we've gone through quite a bit here

1107
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:22,680
we're getting up towards the end of the

1108
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:24,540
episode one of the things I could ask

1109
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:27,299
towards the end is did we miss anything

1110
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:28,739
and also do you have any advice for

1111
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:32,460
beginners who are just getting started

1112
00:51:28,739 --> 00:51:35,039
with this process yes like I'm not

1113
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:38,039
afraid to share my whole experience with

1114
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:40,739
everybody like so like of the breeders

1115
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:43,980
in the game they try to act like there

1116
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:47,578
are secrets that people don't need to

1117
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:49,619
know because we are the only one who we

1118
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:52,619
need to make those seeds and so forth

1119
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:55,260
but I'm like to be an open book and help

1120
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:58,200
people in the community to make their

1121
00:51:55,260 --> 00:52:00,960
own seeds and I encourage everyone to

1122
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:03,358
try to reverse a plant and create their

1123
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,880
own seeds you know with their own

1124
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:08,818
genetic and like I said the main thing

1125
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:11,400
is the genetic that we breed with and

1126
00:52:08,818 --> 00:52:13,619
the the health of the plant but I want

1127
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:16,858
to touch down a little bit into the

1128
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:18,300
nutrition of the plants into creating

1129
00:52:16,858 --> 00:52:20,940
seeds because it's a little bit

1130
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:25,260
different than the nutrition of the

1131
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:28,318
plant when you create a flour for

1132
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:29,819
medicine purpose you know to for smoking

1133
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:33,838
or so on

1134
00:52:29,818 --> 00:52:38,219
um so when when I feed my plants uh for

1135
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:42,000
for seeds I'm not using blue nutrients

1136
00:52:38,219 --> 00:52:45,739
as I usually do with my plants that I'm

1137
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:50,219
growing for flour and I'm actually using

1138
00:52:45,739 --> 00:52:53,219
veg nutrients because the nitrogen into

1139
00:52:50,219 --> 00:52:57,480
the in the to the veg nutrients the high

1140
00:52:53,219 --> 00:53:00,358
content of nitrogen will help create and

1141
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:02,420
harvest a lot more seeds than if you use

1142
00:53:00,358 --> 00:53:05,578
a bloom nutrient with a lot of

1143
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:09,720
phosphorus as potassium so that's what

1144
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:12,780
I'm doing I'm always using new uh veg

1145
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:16,439
nutrients vegetative nutrients with a

1146
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:19,460
high nitrogen content and sometimes I'm

1147
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:24,119
using a nitrogen boost

1148
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:29,338
at the end of my uh of my of my uh

1149
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:32,818
of my plan cycle to measure those seeds

1150
00:53:29,338 --> 00:53:36,299
out so people when they they grow for

1151
00:53:32,818 --> 00:53:39,300
flower they use PK boost to boost their

1152
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:42,660
their flour you know grow bigger flour

1153
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:45,359
when you breed you try to use as much

1154
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:47,399
nitrogen as possible of course you don't

1155
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:50,400
want to burn your plants your nitrogen

1156
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:53,039
but you want to have a lot of nitrogen

1157
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,260
on that on those plants so they can

1158
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:57,779
create a lot of seeds

1159
00:53:55,260 --> 00:54:00,900
that's that that that is the point that

1160
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:03,359
I that that I wanted to make for the new

1161
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:06,300
breeders that they start bringing the

1162
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:09,420
timing of the reversal and feeding veg

1163
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:11,640
nutrients are uh very very important

1164
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,920
other than genetics that are the most

1165
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:15,480
important makes sense thanks for uh

1166
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,400
thanks for expanding on that one so

1167
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:19,440
wrapping things up how can the listeners

1168
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,818
find you and is there anything that you

1169
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,159
have upcoming in the future that you

1170
00:54:20,818 --> 00:54:26,460
want to talk about I have a lot of

1171
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:31,199
things uh coming up I'm trying to to

1172
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:34,980
like I said uh to become a very well

1173
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:38,338
known breather I want to take uh this

00:54:40,858 --> 00:54:46,500
long will will take for me I know will

1177
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:50,579
take some time but I'm very eager to to

1178
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:54,780
to to create the best seeds and the best

1179
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:58,140
genetics in the world and create as much

1180

through my seeds so I'm working all on a

1182
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:09,299
lot of projects at the moment

breeding account on Instagram it's grow

1188
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:27,419
more fire

1189
