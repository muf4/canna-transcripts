1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,040
coming up on garden talk the biggest

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,120
variable for me that i've noticed is the

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,280
phenotypes genetics genetic genetics but

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,719
the phenotype within the genetic has

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,399
been a big focus for me for the past

6
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:13,919
like maybe five years

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,839
sometimes you end up getting a bunch of

8
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,198
variations that are keepers i just was

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,719
over at a buddy's house today and he had

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,920
so many that they were dramatically

11
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,358
different enough that they should almost

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,840
have different names

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,320
make sure you label properly it's so

14
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,079
crucial so important you'll be so bummed

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,439
out when you're like oh man i didn't

16
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,678
label this funeral right and that was

17
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,600
the best one like it could be this or

18
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,439
it's this and it takes three more cycles

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,480
to find out they'll see somebody who's

20
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,839
just knocking out of the park they've

21
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,839
got to realize they got a very good

22
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,040
phenotype potentially good cut or

23
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,559
they've hunted the right one or they

24
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,479
just got lucky that happens sometimes

25
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,000
too but finding the right characteristic

26
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,319
expression within that particular

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,519
genetic i think is huge for any grower

28
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,520
to get the best results

29
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,000
what's up everybody if you that don't

30
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,359
know me my name is chris aka mr growit

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,319
and you're tuned into the garden talk

podcast this episode number 69. in this

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,599
episode i interview rob from cltv he is

back for a second time on this podcast

35
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,879
this time around he's going to get deep

36
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,798
into the process of phenol hunting

37
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,560
plants something he has a ton of

38
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,799

i was gonna say you're no stranger to

86
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,479
garden talk podcast right you're on

87
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,599
episode number one the very first

88
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,759
episode of this podcast was you

89
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:11,119
and we talked all about fertilizing

90
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:13,598
plants that one actually has over 261

91
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,759
000 views so it's like the the second

92
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,518
most viewed on youtube and of course

93
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,598
it's on all podcast platforms as well

94
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,280
but a ridiculous amount of people tuned

95
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,959
into that and there was a ridiculous

96
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,039
amount of people that had

97
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,039
real positive things to say about you

98
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,959
about that discussion and people want

99
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,598
you back for a part two so thanks for

100
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,560
coming back here dude get my lips dried

101
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:34,079
out with all that love though that's

102
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,519
pretty awesome man i really appreciate

103
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,599
that dude that is that's that's really

104
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,039
cool especially to see a conversation

105
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,359
like that that gets to the nitty gritty

106
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,439
of basics and then

107
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,519
you built so much more on the podcast

108
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,598
you know what i'm saying it went to

109
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,840
next level science so it's really cool

110
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,759
to see the inception to where it is now

111
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,158
yeah pretty incredible so today we're

112
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,919
going to get deep into pheno hunting

113
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,280
this is something that you have several

114
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,438
experience with

115
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,598
and you're very passionate about it too

116
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,519
so i'm really excited for this one but

117
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:04,798
first can you introduce yourself to

118
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,759
those that didn't catch the first

119
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,000
episode we did together yeah

120
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,399
if you don't know i'm rob from cltv from

121
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,280
the stash top buds rob blogs two

122
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,399
different channels um been a grower now

123
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,160
for about 14 years uh medical program

124
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,758
here as long as it's been available

125
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,880
since 2008.

126
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,240
so

127
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,680
let's say i've been growing legally for

128
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,879
14 years

129
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,120
definitely have some experience with

130
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,879
other plants but my main favorite is our

131
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,639
favorite herb and

132
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,439
overall since making content and i feel

133
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,960
like i

134
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,478
teaching people i've learned a lot as

135
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,198
well i've changed i've pivoted i've

136
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,039
grown with synthetics organics and the

137
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,360
biggest variable for me that i've

138
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,280
noticed as the phenotypes genetics

139
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,120
genetic genetics but the phenotype

140
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,719
within the genetic has been a big focus

141
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,879
for me for the past like

142
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,720
maybe five years once i really got got

143
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,079
away from the pick and mix and focused a

144
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,360
little bit more on

145
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,478
finding the variety within the single

146
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,800
cultivar

147
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,959
genetics are just so important i mean

148
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,400
that's like the emphasis on it sometimes

149
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,079
i don't think is enough between

150
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,918
particularly new growers like they don't

151
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,758
understand the importance of genetics

152
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,680
like you can have a dialed environment

153
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,439
you know lighting so on so for nutrition

154
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,519
can be dialed in but if you have bad

155
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:16,560
genetics i mean it's just it's not going

156
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,240
to come out anywhere near it would as if

157
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,759
you had good genetics

158
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,960
so um yeah phenotypes genotypes let's

159
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,680
get into it

160
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:29,120
let's dial it back for beginners though

161
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,720
like what is pheno hunting and why do it

162
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,399
no good question there's actually a lot

163
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,160
of debate kind of the bro science side

164
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,399
of female hunting people argue pheno or

165
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,800
geno hunting this is kind of a thing but

166
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,560
final hunting i feel is more of course

167
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,439
finding the characteristic expression

168
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,120
within the cultivar so i use the analogy

169
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,800
of let's say you have the same parents

170
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,478
and you've got brothers and sisters but

171
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,800
you all are a little unique but you all

172
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,159
maybe have the same gap like myself if

173
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,240
you don't know if you're just listening

174
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,600
or you all have you know hair color that

175
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,280
everybody's got red hair well it's a

176
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,439
genetic trait that's carried through but

177
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,239
there's still individuality between each

178
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,680
sibling so it's comparable when you see

179
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,120
a cultivar it's going to be similar

180
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,360
there and then plus the genetic

181
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,680
expression within your environment so

182
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,120
looking for the right cultivar when you

183
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,199
say you want to get a certain genetic it

184
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,560
may not even be that same genetic i for

185
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,478
example had a

186
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,600
i think it was agent orange

187
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,680
it orange something i can't remember

188
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,039
what it was but there was one cultivar

189
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,439
one version of it essentially one

190
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,439
phenotype that was very java coffee-like

191
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,120
and one that was very citrus and orange

192
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,038
i unfortunately was in the pickame

193
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,720
pick-and-mix phase of not knowing you

194
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,959
know different genetic expressions so i

195
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,280
got the java one and it was like this is

196
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,839
bunk i don't like this and it's like

197
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,918
well it was not the right phenotype and

198
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,679
that's really you know it took me about

199
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,758
nine years before i started really

200
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,360
realizing i'm like man i'm comparing

201
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,600
apples to oranges so to speak i'm

202
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,038
comparing my buddies totally different

203
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,800
cultivar essentially i mean it's the

204
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,318
same but it's different different

205
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,639
characteristic expressions that came

206
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,520
from it so that's when i really dove

207
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,199
into phenol hunting and i thought that

208
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,478
when you're looking for genetics you're

209
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,079
not looking for just genetics you're

210
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,318
looking for a particular phenotype

211
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,359
within that genetic so it's changed my

212
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,879
whole approach and i think a lot of

213
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,720
people when they look at one of their

214
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,759
buddy grows they'll see somebody who's

215
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,120
just knocking out of the park they've

216
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,120
got to realize they got a very good

217
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,319
phenotype potentially good cut or

218
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,918
they've hunted the right one or they

219
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,720
just got lucky that happens sometimes

220
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:18,560
too

221
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,160
but but finding the right characteristic

222
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,478
expression within that particular

223
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,240
genetic i think is huge for any grower

224
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:27,360
to get the best results

225
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,759
yeah so each seed is its own phenotype

226
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,680
right if you were to grow one plant and

227
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,400
then take clones of that plant that's

228
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,079
still the same phenotype so just a

229
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,598
couple things to mention there for for

230
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,359
those that don't know

231
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,918
but yeah there can be

232
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,598
so much variability depending on the

233
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,318
genetics depending on you know what

234
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,959
generation it is is it inbreeding that's

235
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,720
done how far down has it gone now we're

236
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,318
kind of getting to de breeding a little

237
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,560
bit we're not gonna really touch on that

238
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,639
topic deeply but

239
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,560
genetics there's variations that happen

240
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,639
with characteristics like you mentioned

241
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,800
and the environment definitely comes

242
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,560
into play heavily

243
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,319
when it comes to different phenotypes

244
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,800
and how they express themselves so do

245
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,680
you pheno hunt males plants female

246
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,879
plants or both currently just female

247
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,639
because i'm not doing any breeding i

248
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,120
don't have the capacity probably even

249
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,240
mental capacity to uh to do any breeding

250
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,160
i'm not on dr growit's level in terms of

251
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,319
even being a hobbyist and giving it a

252
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,800
shot mainly because right now i like to

253
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,039
just find different flower that i like

254
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,560
and while i can find that with breeding

255
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,479
there's some amazing breeders out there

256
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,759
that i'm gonna let them do their job and

257
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,759
then

258
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,958
you know maybe one day when i've got the

259
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,038
space i'll throw my hat in the ring but

260
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,278
for now i like what i got so i'm looking

261
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:44,000
for females usually only okay so females

262
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:47,519
only and you're starting from seed right

263
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and then how many seeds are you planting

264
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,440
for your final hunt it's funny i i

265
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,799
thought i was doing a decent amount

266
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,760
until we had matt mooney on from the

267
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,278
stash

268
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,559
and he's talking about doing a hundred

269
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:58,080
and he's like yeah you know i'm gonna do

270
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,439
a little bit she's probably 100 i'm like

271
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,120
up

272
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,600
a little bit oh

273
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,720
okay well i'm doing 10 on average is

274
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,600
normally what i've done the most i've

275
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,959
done is 20 at a time and at that point

276
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,480
it was because i heard that there was a

277
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,639
lot of different variations of the same

278
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,320
cultivar so i figured why not i'm

279
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,399
looking for one in particular i'll cut

280
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,360
the rest off i just want one

281
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,559
and

282
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,000
sometimes it doesn't happen it's like

283
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,199
getting a pack of baseball cards or

284
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,480
pokemon cards you're looking for a

285
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,160
particular one

286
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,680
you kind of get duds sometimes you end

287
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,600
up getting a bunch of variations that

288
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,120
are keepers i just was over at a buddy's

289
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,560
house today and he had so many that they

290
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,159
were dramatically different enough that

291
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,838
they should almost have different names

292
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,559
they're not even in the same family like

293
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,160
it's

294
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,000
it's crazy those are the type that i'm

295
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,278
concerned about when you recommend it to

296
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,519
somebody because they may not get that

297
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,958
same phenotype issue which is where the

298
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,759
argument of cuts like we talked on from

299
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,599
the stash again referring back of where

300
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,120
you can't secure that exact phenotype

301
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,959
unless you go about that process

302
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,360
differently you can do a major hunt find

303
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:55,359
a bunch and then keep that secured or

304
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,120
you have to find that cut it's not as

305
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,278
easy as some would think it would be

306
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,120
really nice if we could plant a hundred

307
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,120
seeds like you mentioned and

308
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,879
and hunt through those but the reality

309
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,120
of it you know a lot of folks are home

310
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,720
growers i have a plant count i'm sure

311
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,879
you have a plant count as well in your

312
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,480
state so we have a maximum number that

313
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,399
we're allowed to grow

314
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,720
legally so staying with that that's

315
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,559
certainly important and you can still

316
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,160
have a phenol hunt within the matter you

317
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,759
know you could do like five plants ten

318
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,838
plants like you can do a low number it

319
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,679
doesn't have to be a hundred plants in

320
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,800
order to do a true phenomenon like you

321
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,838
mentioned you might not find what you're

322
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:32,159
looking for right so you might plant 10

323
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,600
15 seeds whatever and then none of them

324
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,919
are actually what you're looking for in

325
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,240
that cultivar then you start over right

326
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,439
you just you you kill off those plants

327
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,120
or consume those plants whatever and

328
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,680
then you just plant new seeds and

329
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,799
continue your hunt that's perfectly fine

330
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,958
yeah i'm doing that right now with the

331
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,120
chill at og and depending luckily i know

332
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,559
the guy who having to breed it so worst

333
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,399
case condition

334
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,559
if i don't find the one i'm after growth

335
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,159
wise they're just on point they both

336
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,639
look like twins but one is hungrier than

337
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,399
the other and one of them is noticeably

338
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,559
more tracked out than the other but who

339
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,759
knows at the end you know but it's hard

340
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,759
because when you're limited on the

341
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,519
phenotypes you have you're literally

342
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,439
kind of stuck between the two options

343
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,278
but it's cool you know at some points

344
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,480
but when they're so similar that's where

345
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:14,320
it's like where do you decide like which

346
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,200
ones you keep you know they're like the

347
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,680
same

348
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,000
then it's a good sign but i do sometimes

349
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,879
like those genetic variations where you

350
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,360
have

351
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,200
one that leans this way more sour

352
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,600
more more funky and another one that may

353
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,879
be more deep gas or more sweet so that

354
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,800
way you've got a little bit of variety

355
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,799
but also grow very comparable so that

356
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,278
way your candy or canopy could be even

357
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,559
and you do it like that you see um

358
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,000
gorilla butter they've got white

359
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,919
truffles that's one that i have that's a

360
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,440
cut most people just know it as that

361
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,559
genetic but it's actually a named

362
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,240
phenotype

363
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,000
you know gorilla glue number four that

364
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,839
number four is a number four for a

365
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,440
reason you know what i'm saying the

366
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,680
phenotype usually the number is what

367
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,079
people did nowadays to identify these

368
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,078
particular characteristics i personally

369
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,078
think it's okay to rename a cut as long

370
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,919
as you give you know respect and you

371
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,838
mentioned that this is a cut of this

372
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,919
particular cultivar but it's getting to

373
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,680
the point now where the the phenotypes

374
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,120
are the more focused what pheno did this

375
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,120
person have what phenos at that

376
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,720
dispensary what pheno did they they

377
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,000
secure if you're just getting seeds you

378
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,440
don't really know you're just saying i

379
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,480
got these seeds we'll see if i get it in

380
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,360
this pack

381
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,959
you know

382
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,000
that's true that's very true so when

383
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:22,958
you're starting your pheno hunt

384
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,958
what medium are you using to begin and

385
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,518
then also i guess container size

386
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,759
container type you talk about that yeah

387
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,240
um so when i first get started i'm

388
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,078
usually using like a solo cup to get

389
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,000
started with cocoa i'm usually nine

390
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,000
times out of ten using royal gold's

391
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,399
tuper but they run out often where i'm

392
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,159
at locally so i'll use an alternative as

393
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,679
close as i can i'll use maybe coco loco

394
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,679
and cut it with a little bit of base

395
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,679
regular cocoa and if anything add a

396
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,759
little perlite for some aeration and

397
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,439
then i start really like low on my food

398
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,439
if any food at all to begin for

399
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,399
nutrients whether that be organic side

400
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,720
or

401
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,240
mineral base is low dose to get going so

402
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,480
that way i can get the

403
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,320
the stronger growing obviously seed but

404
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,759
not overpower and kill it and burn it

405
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,278
when it's young because again i want to

406
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:06,958
get the most natural best

407
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,320
characteristics and expressions from the

408
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,119
genetics so i know which one i want to

409
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,800
keep

410
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,879
from there i'll move up to a larger pot

411
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,879
usually either one gallon or a three to

412
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,879
five it depends if i'm using a cloth pot

413
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,078
sometimes i'll just go right into a five

414
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,759
it just uh

415
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:20,879
i guess more for a mess not necessarily

416
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,120
anything behind that i just don't like

417
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,278
making a big mess and then uh just plain

418
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,639
water with uh light nutrients usually

419
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:30,480
low on like

420
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,200
150 200 ppm very very low

421
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,920
so

422
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,000
using synthetic bottled nutrients or are

423
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,000
you talking organics yes for synthetic

424
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,919
bottled nutrients appreciate you pulling

425
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,480
that one out okay yeah it's interesting

426
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,240
that you mentioned cocoa as your medium

427
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,000
because

428
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,000
there are so many variables that can

429
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,159
happen just within like the soil for

430
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,519
example within the medium and you're

431
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,039
starting with coker starting with an

432
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,278
inert medium do you have anything

433
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,198
against starting in soil like that's

434
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,320
pre-charged with nutrients does that

435
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,159
kind of

436
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,920
i mean there's so many variables i

437
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:03,278
personally feel like if you're starting

438
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:04,559
in a soil that's already pre-charged

439
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,799
with nutrients you really don't know

440
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,559
what's in that mix

441
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,240
not every single one of those mixes can

442
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,679
buy it kind of be the same off for each

443
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,600
container i mean but when you're in

444
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,439
cocoa you're starting with an inert

445
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,800
medium you're mixing up your nutrients

446
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,560
that are the same ppm and you're

447
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,319
distributing them all to the to the

448
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:23,679
individual plants right so it's kind of

449
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,360
like more dialed in as far as feeding

450
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,039
what are your thoughts on like

451
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,120
phenomenal i mean certainly can still be

452
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,799
done within soil but like

453
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,839
what are your thoughts overall on that

454
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,919
avenue no i i that's a very very valid

455
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,600
question i think if you're looking to

456
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,679
scale or if you're in a caregiver

457
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,000
operation or looking to go craft or

458
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,838
commercial that should be a big focus

459
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,078
you want to get the best expression

460
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,680
period but if you already have an

461
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,679
established garden you want to integrate

462
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,599
what works for your established garden i

463
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,278
don't think changing everything to fit

464
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,320
one cultivar would make sense unless

465
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:55,838
this is the one that you need for

466
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,079
medicine and it's going to change your

467
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,320
life or your family's life maybe but

468
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,399
otherwise like if let's say you are a

469
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,920
firm believer using uh

470
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,919
you know build a soil and you're running

471
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,278
that and you don't want to change

472
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,439
because you're like well i've been using

473
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:11,198
this mix forever you know then make sure

474
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,800
it works with with what you have if that

475
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,399
genetic doesn't that phenotype doesn't

476
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:15,838
well then it's telling you it's not

477
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,679
meant to be in your garden that's that's

478
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,519
my belief at least personally but if

479
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,919
you're looking to take this as a

480
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,000
business or profession or a real serious

481
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,439
hobby then maybe you do want to start

482
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,480
totally clean

483
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,240
and

484
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,240
get the best version of that particular

485
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,320
cultivar the particular phenotype of the

486
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,440
cultivar doing it that way i don't

487
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,120
really think about it in that way but

488
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,199
that's that's a great point that you

489
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,759
made there that makes sense

490
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,519
so you've got your plants growing and

491
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,480
during a phenol hunt the plants are

492
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,560
going to start to show different

493
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,240
characteristics there are many different

494
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,559
characteristics that you can look for

495
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,480
when phenol hunting what characteristics

496
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:53,119
do you look for it's a good question as

497
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,759
well so only recently have i really

498
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,480
really focused on leaf to bud ratio

499
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,759
wasn't a big thing for me before um the

500
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,120
stacking of the nodes how tight the

501
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,120
nodes are in the leaf to bud ratio

502
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,198
because i'm a solo trimmer 90 of the

503
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,480
time and big shout out ac infinity

504
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,319
because i got the trim bowl from them i

505
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,839
can use that that'll help but for the

506
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,600
most part

507
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,440
i've had some cultivars that i let go in

508
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,519
the past you know a couple years 11

509
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,120
roses being one of them it was great

510
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,278
very very nice one

511
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,120
but i hated trimming it so that's like

512
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,039
my first factor is like

513
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,039
is this a squatty

514
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,879
leafy mess that's going to it's going to

515
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:29,278
be a lot of work to train it let alone

516
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,000
finish it that's like number one as i'm

517
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,439
looking then that speed of growth now it

518
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,440
depends because

519
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,160
prep example chill out og was slower

520
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,240
grower for me big wide but not tall and

521
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,799
lanky like my others but the the

522
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,480
stacking of the nodes i was like

523
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,879
like this growth here i can have these

524
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,320
big tall you know amazon women here that

525
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,159
have stretchy nodes or i have these

526
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,240
shorter ones that are compact with not

527
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:53,679
crazy leaves so it's another check in

528
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,159
the book where i'm like man that leaf to

529
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,758
bud with the node stacking really makes

530
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,919
a big difference it kind of trumps the

531
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,278
the speed of growth for me because again

532
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,198
i'm going to potentially get more yield

533
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:06,400
once it's in flowers and flower

534
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,838
so there's that i don't really focus a

535
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,079
whole lot on

536
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,678
like the leaf size or

537
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,678
anything in that sense but i do look a

538
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,600
little bit on some genetics i notice

539
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,000
will get those natural purple stems like

540
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,678
just reddish kind of purple stems i do

541
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,519
try to avoid those ones when i can it

542
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,120
just seems like they want more or less

543
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,720
they're a little finicky but some

544
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,159
cultivars lately especially i've been

545
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,759
noticing

546
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,160
they purple up as a plant and that's

547
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,160
kind of like in the genetic makeup of it

548
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,880
so i look at something that doesn't show

549
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,080
me the the tendencies of stress early on

550
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,320
something that's not going to show me

551
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,000
that it may need more down the road that

552
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,839
it's going to fit within my cycle

553
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,359
because i don't want to have especially

554
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,519
synthetic i don't want to have multiple

555
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:47,678
different containers or reservoirs with

556
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,440
different amounts of nutrients for a

557
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,798
couple different cultivars if half of my

558
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,519
room something and the other half is

559
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:55,599
that maybe but otherwise like if you're

560
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,918
not working in my mix already

561
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,279
he gots to go it's not gonna it's

562
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,480
that'll again kind of push everything

563
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,399
out because it's like man i really have

564
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,679
to work hard to make you last

565
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,360
versus i mean you got to put in work but

566
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,798
if i'm already putting work over here

567
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,519
and what's already established what i

568
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:08,798
like

569
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,639
i'm not going to throw the risk over

570
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:11,759
here with this final hunt to take

571
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,280
something in that's going to mess up my

572
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:14,960
whole cycle

573
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,720
and then once we're in the flower of

574
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,038
course i'm looking trichome production

575
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,798
i'm looking at um

576
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:23,038
i wouldn't say i'm i'm

577
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,639
huge on bud structure per se i don't

578
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,000
want fox tilly stuff but i do like some

579
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,640
stuff that's got some density i don't

580
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,400
like super airy you know fluffy

581
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,640
sativa-like so to speak in terms of

582
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,320
plant growth structure so i'm trying to

583
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,679
find something that that fits and has

584
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,599
that tightness to it but also has the

585
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,240
trichomes to look color is not a big

586
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,159
deal at all for me personally and purple

587
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,839
is just purple but when you get that

588
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,759
it's a nice perk to pick wow look at

589
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,720
this exotic stuff here change the game

590
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,519
you know

591
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,160
it's

592
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:52,720
it's not a huge deal but the number one

593
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,558
factor for me number number one

594
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,480
is those terps types of flavonoids

595
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,678
flavonoids find out later but the terps

596
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,079
if i'm smelling that and i don't smell

597
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,240
anything or if it smells like something

598
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,599
i don't like at all it's like i'm

599
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,279
getting rid of these clones right now

600
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,519
don't even want to do this not even keep

601
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,720
her around personally okay so you named

602
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,279
off a large handful of things that

603
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,000
relate to the morphology of the plant uh

604
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,160
and also the the chemotype as well you

605
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,558
talked about now how about

606
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,960
do you look at when the plant starts to

607
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,960
flower at all or the total flowering

608
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,840
time does that matter to you at all or

609
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,440
no total flowering time is one for me

610
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,599
only recently again i find that out with

611
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,759
the gmo where i was like i could wait 13

612
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:33,119
weeks worst case i pull these others

613
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,599
these two are still in here for a little

614
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,879
while and i'm good well if you grow them

615
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,798
like your others they're huge and take

616
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,880
up space and your canopy is wonky and

617
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,798
weird because of that setup depending on

618
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,520
your setup if you've got a 4x4 it might

619
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:47,519
be the whole tent if you've got a larger

620
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:50,240
space or an open space it's throwing

621
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,480
everything off and i can't stand that i

622
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,640
can't stand the something that's going

623
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,960
to be a staggered cultivar that doesn't

624
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,640
necessarily give me the results i want

625
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,919
so if i know it's going to be a long one

626
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,200
it usually doesn't even make it into the

627
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,200
grow

628
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,038
this one was just sheer ignorance me not

629
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,759
looking it up so yeah i don't

630
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,319
necessarily focus too heavy on that but

631
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,000
i guess at the in the same

632
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,240
same side like a late bloomer so to

633
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,919
speak something that's it doesn't get

634
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,519
going quicker that also is an issue for

635
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,600
me too sometimes because right now i'm

636
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,400
dealing with that with the um the white

637
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,759
truffles

638
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,360
it's like i have to grow that all

639
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,679
together otherwise it just seems like my

640
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,119
canopy fills out it stretches longer

641
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,480
than the others do it it keeps that

642
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,000
stretch going versus the others start

643
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,000
flowering quicker and i'm like man i've

644
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,038
got a canopy that slides down like a

645
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,400
mountain

646
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:36,000
they don't have to put it up on crates

647
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,360
or something to make it real even and

648
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,558
when you're using trellising or anything

649
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:40,798
for stability that could be a real

650
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,158
headache so i guess i do look at both

651
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:44,158
factors they're just not as crucial

652
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,039
other than the time of how long

653
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,840
it takes not doing 13 weeks anymore ever

654
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,519
okay and then going back to the smell

655
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,599
one of the common techniques that people

656
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,279
use when they're phenol hunting is the

657
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,240
stem rub technique so they take their

658
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,639
fingers

659
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,640
and they'll basically rub the stem and

660
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,559
then they'll smell their fingers and see

661
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,320
if they're it's what they like it's what

662
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:05,918
they're looking for do you do that

663
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,000
technique at all or are you doing

664
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,400
something else you know i have in the

665
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,679
past and usually if it's got a sharp

666
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,080
smell then usually there's sharp

667
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,919
terpenes but the distinct

668
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:17,918
distinctiveness of that terpene i don't

669
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,000
get from the stem rub i get either if

670
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,679
anything like a lime with chlorophyll

671
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,960
cucumber kind of smell but it's sharp

672
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,960
where i'm like

673
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,720
that's good it smells smells like flour

674
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,200
you know but not

675
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,519
like the gas or like the berry or

676
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,038
whatever the actual flower really gives

677
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:36,079
but when i smell one then it smells like

678
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,679
nothing it's like is

679
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:38,960
nothing there you know i literally don't

680
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,400
smell anything that's going to be

681
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,159
different for me because i just right

682
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,000
off the bat my assumption this could be

683
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,360
placebo my assumption is the flower is

684
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,440
going to be the same way

685
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,879
so then i it just drops down in my book

686
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,960
when i'm like in my phone i'll usually

687
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,799
document everything in google keep and

688
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,640
then i have evernote that i'll use for

689
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,079
like just backing up the specific

690
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,280
details i don't always have to add a lot

691
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:58,720
of stuff but if there's something like

692
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:59,918
that i'll be like this one smells like

693
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,319
cardboard

694
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,880
there's nothing here this is drywall

695
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,759
okay and then another common thing that

696
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,440
people do is they'll deliberately

697
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,038
stress their plants

698
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,038
at certain times throughout their grow

699
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,480
now they do it for for various reasons

700
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,960
right they could do a

701
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,120
a stress for feeding purposes to see how

702
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,880
well it handles nutrients they could do

703
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:22,959
stress to try to bring out more trichome

704
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,039
development are you doing any type of

705
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,960
precision stress throughout the grow at

706
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,319
all while you're female hunting so my

707
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,159
first run and i feel like you'll

708
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,240
probably ask me about this at a certain

709
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,840
point my first run when i'm doing a

710
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,839
final hunt i don't

711
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,038
do a whole lot to the plant sometimes

712
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,199
i'll

713
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:40,240
barely even low stress train or top it

714
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,919
you know what i'm saying just because i

715
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,519
want to see what it does naturally i've

716
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,038
had a few cultivars that grow like

717
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,158
christmas trees and i've had a few that

718
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,000
come out looking like they've been

719
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,320
topped like naturally top themselves i'm

720
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,720
like what how do i have so many goals on

721
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:54,879
this one i did nothing that for me shows

722
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,720
a lot of just natural characteristics

723
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,320
for the growth then after that i'm like

724
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,400
all right well what can i do to

725
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,158
manipulate this better should i

726
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,240
do more of an aggressive high stress

727
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,400
training or should i do like an actual

728
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,480
lower technique lower stress technique

729
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,559
and at that point it's usually the

730
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,000
second or third run before i even really

731
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:12,798
start to get to manipulation in that

732
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,960
area

733
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:16,480
now with with nutrient stress i usually

734
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,919
never do that because i've already i

735
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,679
have a perpetual growth so i'm already

736
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,038
running ones that i like in there so i'm

737
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,759
not going to just increase heavy on the

738
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:24,480
ppm they see just for the one

739
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:26,158
but

740
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,159
if i'm doing a full room like i did

741
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,080
recently with the uh the truffles which

742
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,000
is a particular pheno i had but it's do

743
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:33,678
i want to keep this genetic in my garden

744
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,119
i ended up going higher in everything

745
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,120
like even my light was more intense just

746
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,558
to see how it it turned out and it

747
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,639
handled the stress pretty well tons of

748
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,839
trichomes the fade was insane on it

749
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,120
looked better than any i've seen in

750
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,959
person personally of any of these

751
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,399
truffles and i can't take the credit for

752
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,200
it it just seems like that genetic can

753
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,679
take a little more and in its defense

754
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,000
will express more you know cool color

755
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,038
more trichomes more terpenes more things

756
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,798
like that

757
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:58,079
so i don't go too hard early but i give

758
00:23:56,798 --> 00:23:59,759
it some time to integrate it into my

759
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,678
garden before i really

760
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:02,798
you know hit it gotcha and then you did

761
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,880
touch upon

762
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:06,319
training a little bit

763
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,080
i know some folks what they'll do is

764
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,439
they'll go as far as you know in order

765
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,599
to testify the vigor of the plant

766
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,519
they'll actually snap branches to see

767
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,519
how the branches snap

768
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,038
do you do anything like that or no i

769
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:18,400
don't but i've got a buddy who does that

770
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,000
all the time he's very very very

771
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,919
aggressive with the plant to see he's

772
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,798
like see if he ends up getting seeds or

773
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,640
something

774
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:26,960
i'm like oh i'm trying to see if it

775
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,240
hermes which i guess like you know i get

776
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,519
where that comes in because what if an

777
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,759
accident happens once you have this in

778
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,200
production so to speak you really should

779
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,038
stress test it just like anything that

780
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,558
goes to market it gets a stress test if

781
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,319
you give it the most perfect environment

782
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,759
it's like yeah of course it does good

783
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,278
but you know

784
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:42,879
move it to somewhere more difficult and

785
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,038
it's not going to perform the same way

786
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,720
so giving a good stress test could help

787
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:48,240
me personally i don't i don't go that

788
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,839
hard with it i don't want to break them

789
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,798
my goal at the end is to have a decent

790
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,839
amount of high quality product and

791
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:56,400
if i'm

792
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,918
delaying the the flowering period or the

793
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,600
vegging period by doing some stuff like

794
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,440
that it's not beneficial to me

795
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,798
personally unless i have a lot of

796
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,880
you know clones from that particular

797
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:06,079
phenotype so that's usually the second

798
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,919
run where i'll get a little more well

799
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,439
second or third and i'm like oh let's

800
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,278
see what this does let's see if i top

801
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,200
this or bend this down or just crack

802
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:14,880
this over here just put a little tape

803
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,080
around it see if it recovers

804
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,159
you know and

805
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,079
it it's good to find out but then at

806
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,159
that point i've already kind of decided

807
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:23,839
what i've liked in terms of flavor so

808
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,000
then it's like is this that much better

809
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,439
of a grower that i can sacrifice a

810
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,240
little bit of the terpenes and a little

811
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,759
bit of the end result product for this

812
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,200
and i guess the mentality for me isn't

813
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:35,440
the same as for someone who's looking

814
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,558
for production for you know caregiver

815
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,159
caregiver side of hand but we'll just

816
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:40,960
say other reasons

817
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,320
wink wink if you're not watching but

818
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,600
some people may be focused heavier on

819
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:45,200
the yield and they could sacrifice a

820
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:46,879
little bit of the terpenes and more and

821
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,960
more people don't care as much about

822
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,559
terpenes which sounds crazy but i'm

823
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,079
realizing this people just like myself

824
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:53,839
who will drink corona or bud light or

825
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,199
miller light aren't chasing after the

826
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,278
flavor of beer as much as we are the

827
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,200
effect of beer as for somebody you know

828
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,278
same with flavor for for flour they may

829
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,120
not be looking for that crazy unique

830
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:05,200
terpene but they want something in the

831
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,798
ballpark a light undertone

832
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,880
so somebody may be looking at a

833
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:11,200
characteristic or treating it a certain

834
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,960
way for different variables than myself

835
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,640
that's a really good way to put it it

836
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,079
seems like more and more people are

837
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,400
caring less about biomass and more about

838
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:21,759
things like blood density

839
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,519
terpenes

840
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,119
and so on so forth i'm actually doing a

841
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,119
phenol hunt right now so for those that

842
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:30,079
don't know i have my own cross

843
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:32,239
it's briskero g male i cross with a

844
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:34,720
female of pakistan valley and that's

845
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,720
named chilo do g it's actually

846
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,880
inbreeding i'm going down to generation

847
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,880
f2 right now i'm working on that going

848
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,880
to an f3 but i don't do any training i

849
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,400
didn't do any training this run just

850
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,960
letting the plants grow naturally seeing

851
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,200
how its natural shape occurs right i was

852
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,798
looking particularly for that branching

853
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,960
to naturally come out

854
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,798
versus i mean i get some cultivars where

855
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,558
you just got that one cola coming

856
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:58,639
straight up and really not much side

857
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:01,200
branching but having that branching and

858
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,520
having a more even structure it's easier

859
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,519
to train in the future have that even

860
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:08,158
canopy even bud structure across all the

861
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,679
branches so on and so forth so yeah i'm

862
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,278
just like you where i don't really do

863
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,200
much training i just kind of look at the

864
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:15,679
plan naturally and see how is that

865
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,440
structure looking you know yeah 100 i

866
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,278
think that's where you can really decide

867
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,679
if this genetic just out of the gate is

868
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:23,359
a beast just like i mean anybody can be

869
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,640
an athlete if you train enough and you

870
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,719
work out enough and you take the right

871
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,759
supplements maybe even steroids if

872
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,919
you're weird like that but whatever you

873
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:31,200
want to do you can get to that point too

874
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,880
and some people are natural athletes

875
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,960
where they're just this ox and just a

876
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,559
tank and it's like man you're a lineman

877
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,480
like look at trey and look at me i

878
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:41,038
cannot defend you running down to the

879
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,599
the finish line like i may push one

880
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,519
person trey will debo somebody nadamikon

881
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:47,199
zoo style step on you walking through

882
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,200
boom boom you'll see that with plants

883
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,278
too you'll see some big hearty monsters

884
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,038
that are just these next level ones that

885
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:55,119
you don't have to do as much work to and

886
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,640
you're yielding like crazy and others

887
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:58,158
that you really have to manipulate to

888
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,440
get to that point

889
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,440
so you really want to see the natural

890
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,399
characteristics i feel in a female hunt

891
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,399
before you

892
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:06,558
you do that i agree

893
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,558
i do want to go back to lighting for a

894
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:09,918
few minutes here uh you touched upon it

895
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:11,278
a little bit some people are actually

896
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,720
going to push their plants with lighting

897
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,960
so they're trying to they're measuring

898
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,200
the ppfd they're measuring that par

899
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,720
and they're trying to increase it and

900
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,000
give it um the maximum amount as

901
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,440
possible and seeing how the plants are

902
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,119
going to react other people what they're

903
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,519
doing is they're

904
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,519
lowering the light level and they're

905
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,359
kind of making sure that the plant isn't

906
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:32,000
suffering you know what i mean that it's

907
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,839
it's it's coming across without having

908
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,079
issues that it's like a normal grow i

909
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:38,798
guess you could say nothing extreme are

910
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,639
you doing any sort of light manipulation

911
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:43,038
uh either stressing it with more light

912
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,960
or you just kind of having normal light

913
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:47,200
levels or reduce light levels when you

914
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,440
are phenomenal so kind of like i

915
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,200
mentioned uh before once i get

916
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,120
once i decide i like this flavor and i'm

917
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,480
gonna keep it around then maybe i'd

918
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:55,599
start doing more of that i'm doing it

919
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,120
right now with the white truffle and

920
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:58,798
that's not necessarily a phenotype it's

921
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,798
just a cultivar a phenotype of the

922
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,158
cultivar so

923
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:03,759
once i get further i do that but i

924
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,440
really like to just integrate it into my

925
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:06,720
garden so i don't want to push it like i

926
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,240
know i would never go that much higher

927
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,839
with my light so why do it i know i

928
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,079
would never add much more nutrients so

929
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,240
why do it like i wouldn't go and just

930
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,519
randomly break branches so i do it you

931
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,519
know what i'm saying like i want it to

932
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,278
fit into my garden or else it's not

933
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,440
gonna fit into my garden my flavor

934
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:22,880
choice is one thing i'm very blessed i

935
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,320
work with companies like franklin field

936
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,320
so they can grow some stuff that i may

937
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:27,439
not love i mean i love it but i mean i

938
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:29,439
love to grow

939
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,679
and then i can grow the stuff that fits

940
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,360
for my particular garden i notice right

941
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,519
now everything i have is

942
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,959
kind of lenkier got that sativa like

943
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,759
look other than the cell at og which is

944
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,880
squattier and thick tight colas already

945
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:43,200
and

946
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,399
so far like that would have to be a solo

947
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,080
run you know what i'm saying like the

948
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:47,119
cello would have to be like mono crop so

949
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:48,000
to speak where i'm just going to run

950
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,000
this

951
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,720
by itself so i could fill the room up

952
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,640
canopy's even train the same done right

953
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,720
versus these lanky ones that i have to

954
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,038
really manipulate and work to even fit

955
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,919
in the same space it's just

956
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:04,000
the cultivars don't match together so

957
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,520
my light intensity of what i would do to

958
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,839
increase it is going to be when i do

959
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,759
maybe the solo run by itself after i've

960
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,599
kind of run it through my personal crop

961
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,759
i see how i like it see it's doing good

962
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:15,199
move it to a four by four then push it a

963
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:16,960
little bit like man can i get maybe more

964
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,200
out of this can this handle more like

965
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,200
this may be that that random unicorn out

966
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,360
there that hits all the marks but then

967
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,240
also can take more so i can push it i've

968
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:28,079
got this uh x3 ultra from chiltek and

969
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,240
it's like let's see what we can do baby

970
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:31,839
let's see what we can do you know so i

971
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,240
imagine since you're doing different

972
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,599
stressors throughout multiple runs a

973
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,440
common technique that people do i

974
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:39,759
believe you do is you take clones at

975
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,000
some point so you'll grow the plants and

976
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:44,079
during the vegetation stage i don't know

977
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,720
how long you're vegging the plants for

978
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:47,918
but at some point you're taking clones

979
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,000
and then you're having those clones kind

980
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,480
of like on the side on standby and then

981
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,919
you're finishing up your phenohunt and

982
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,360
then you're i guess you're taking those

983
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,038
clones and then you're doing your next

984
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:58,558
run is that kind of how that's working

985
00:30:57,038 --> 00:30:59,839
yeah yeah the next clone would be like

986
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:01,200
my temporary mother which i usually

987
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,359
don't keep a mother plant around for a

988
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,480
while but just to secure that genetic

989
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:05,599
i'll have one that i'm like well i'm

990
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,880
just going to cut on you you're not

991
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,278
doing nothing just to make sure i keep

992
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,120
you like i don't want to sacrifice it by

993
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:13,519
mislabeling something or it gets lost in

994
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,678
the mix not happening so usually what

995
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,079
i'll do is about two three weeks before

996
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,360
i flip in the flour i'll do my you know

997
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:21,119
stripping of the bottom area and i'll

998
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:23,359
take most of those cuts sometimes a

999
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,639
couple from the tops but to make sure i

1000
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:26,879
got an adequate amount of time for

1001
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,320
recovery before i flip the flower now

1002
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,159
flipping a flower isn't necessarily

1003
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,480
being in flower just a light cycle so i

1004
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,960
still got that thyme that little window

1005
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,399
of vegging still so to speak so the

1006
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,399
plants really fully recovered by the

1007
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:39,518
time i go back in there now the next run

1008
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,918
of clones is already sitting in the

1009
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,240
cloner they're going and i'm growing

1010
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,480
them with less

1011
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,919
like a full intention i'm doing the

1012
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,679
manipulation to the plant i'm doing some

1013
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,360
training but knowing that hey i may not

1014
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,200
keep these four here depending if i

1015
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:55,278
don't like this pheno like i literally

1016
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,798
will go in there call the herd if i have

1017
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,720
to i don't want to have a room full of

1018
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:00,879
stuff i don't like i've got

1019
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,240
way more flower stuff i don't like than

1020
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,919
what i do so currently even still like

1021
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,240
don't even want to smoke it so it's to

1022
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,679
the point where you you really have to

1023
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,440
pick and choose when you're in a smaller

1024
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,360
space and you're final hunting like how

1025
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,038
many clones am i going to take because i

1026
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:17,038
may not keep all these clones i've done

1027
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:19,200
that before where i've got 10 of each

1028
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:21,119
and it was so stupid because i only

1029
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,640
wanted to keep one out of five of the

1030
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:25,278
phenotypes

1031
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,278
and so i had 50 when i was more i had

1032
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:29,359
more more patience at the time

1033
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,440
and it was a big mistake because my

1034
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:34,000
whole run was just stuff i didn't like

1035
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,679
man it was just as flat as it gets to

1036
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
80s booty just nothing so

1037
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,320
for me how i will run my stuff is three

1038
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,119
clones of each sometimes two and it'll

1039
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:47,839
be labeled as uh like chillado ga

1040
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,359
chiloto gb total gc and then i've got

1041
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:51,599
those added into my phone and i know

1042
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:53,678
that they're within row a

1043
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:56,079
one two three row b you know what i'm

1044
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,679
saying so that it's pretty easy to know

1045
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:59,199
what i've got and that way once it comes

1046
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,440
back through the larger plan that's in

1047
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,440
flower that's labeled chill at oga child

1048
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,038
gb i could choose the one i like and say

1049
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,278
i really didn't like this one over here

1050
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:08,640
so you're gone but you two i gotta we're

1051
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:10,000
gonna run you again i'm gonna i gotta

1052
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,600
see which and battle of the bands with

1053
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,960
you and see which is better because a

1054
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:14,719
lot of times for me i don't know to the

1055
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,720
second or third run

1056
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,720
like from going from from

1057
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,720
directly from the start yeah your plant

1058
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,079
may be hardier and you have the tap root

1059
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,839
and everything there you're doing great

1060
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:25,199
there but then from a clone

1061
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:27,278
i feel like i can really find like do i

1062
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,640
like this smoke is this what i want

1063
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:30,720
growth is a big thing but i'm a

1064
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,240
connoisseur so i want to know after a

1065
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,038
run or two how it's reacting to my

1066
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,319
garden how this next one was acclimated

1067
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:38,720
to my environment that's when you really

1068
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,798
see the the phenotype expressions i feel

1069
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,480
like is when your environment gets used

1070
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:44,960
to it when i first take in a cut it's

1071
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,558
like that runs pretty good i see it's

1072
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,880
good but the next one is like damn i

1073
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,398
don't know what i did but this is fire

1074
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,640
it's like i changed nothing it's just

1075
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:54,639
been here now i think it's getting used

1076
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,559
to my routine and the plant is

1077
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,080
acclimating to it how long are you

1078
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,079
typically keeping your plants in the

1079
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,359
vegetation stage when female hunting

1080
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,199
this one was longer than normal because

1081
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:06,000
i wanted to take a fair amount of cuts

1082
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,159
so i kept it in for about maybe nine

1083
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,159
weeks ballpark normally it's six to

1084
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,159
eight weeks at the most like at the very

1085
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,838
most because again the stretch that i

1086
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,599
normally get with the other cultivars i

1087
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:16,639
didn't know anything about the cellos in

1088
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,480
particular because that's what i'm doing

1089
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,240
the phenom hunt of right now i wasn't

1090
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,000
sure how they'd grow it's like are they

1091
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,598
going to be lanky is going to be tall

1092
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,039
then how fat and squatty they were to

1093
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,720
get going and then they morphed in a

1094
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:28,000
couple weeks i'm like

1095
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,678
all right so we're just going to see

1096
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,599
what you ladies do and get you going

1097
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,200
longer and then i had did a little bit

1098
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,480
of training to it to two of them that

1099
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,078
were just a little link here and i was

1100
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,760
like yeah it's

1101
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,960
i see how you grow you know what i'm

1102
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,240
saying like i'm going to train you and

1103
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,398
then there were dudes so i'm like no

1104
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,759
no if i was hunting for males they would

1105
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:48,719
have been prime candidates because they

1106
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,040
reeked like outside smells when i cut

1107
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,918
him down the garbage reeked so that was

1108
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:52,960
a

1109
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,158
probably a good breeder i probably

1110
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,838
should have got you some final in there

1111
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,760
but

1112
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:59,119
when you're looking for

1113
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,640
what's right for you sometimes you got

1114
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,920
to give it a little more time because if

1115
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:03,598
you want to take a fair amount of cuts

1116
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,760
you're going to be putting a plant in

1117
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,680
there that's not at its full

1118
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,160
potential because it's been hacked on

1119
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:12,799
and chopped out and worked you know

1120
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:15,199
yeah i get exactly what you mean

1121
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,440
so you've got your plants growing

1122
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,439
at what point you start to kill off

1123
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,200
plants are you letting them grow all the

1124
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,800
way through and killing them off are you

1125
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:24,960
like looking at the characteristics

1126
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,560
during each stage of growth and then

1127
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,000
killing off plants like for example

1128
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,000
killing off plants in the vegetation

1129
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,679
stage then maybe you're putting him into

1130
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,880
flower and then evaluating what they

1131
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:34,639
look like and then killing off plants

1132
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,640
and flowering so on and so forth how do

1133
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:39,039
you go about like killing off plants

1134
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:41,039
yeah because i'm more of a connoisseur

1135
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:42,639
than like i'm a grower but i'm a smoker

1136
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,880
more than anything i feel like i'm a

1137
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:47,679
gore because i'm such a smoker and so so

1138
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,119
picky but i do love to grow um i

1139
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:51,679
normally don't let it go until it's

1140
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,119
fully cured like i won't even consider

1141
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:54,719
cutting them they're they're gonna stick

1142
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,400
around until i know and then sometimes

1143
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,519
again that second run i'll let it go

1144
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,880
through again

1145
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:00,719
if i would have done this maybe i let it

1146
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,800
go a little longer you know i know it

1147
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:06,319
says you know 60 or 70 days but maybe 75

1148
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,480
baby would have would have brought up

1149
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,559
something more so i usually will wait

1150
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,838
you know i'm not gonna kill it there's

1151
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:13,838
been too many times i've had my great

1152
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:15,519
white buffalo so to speak the one that

1153
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,599
got away man and it's

1154
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:19,519
it's depressing there's this sour cush i

1155
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,760
always remember i'll never forget it so

1156
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:24,480
good and then uh holy grail cush that

1157
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,400
was another one i went through 10 packs

1158
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,760
of that one ten packs never found the

1159
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,440
same phenotype

1160
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,000
so it's like

1161
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,519
you can't let stuff go until you know

1162
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,519
and it's just it's man those are bars

1163
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:37,039
too but it's mandatory it's mandatory

1164
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:38,320
you gotta you gotta let it go through

1165
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:40,079
all the way to see because it could

1166
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,760
change in the last couple weeks that

1167
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,079
cure could change the game but if it's

1168
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,839
growing so poorly and it's going to ruin

1169
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,160
your production

1170
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,440
you may want to call herd just depends

1171
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:51,118
yeah because i mean there's good i know

1172
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,960
there's some female hunters that they're

1173
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,039
looking for that vigor and if they find

1174
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,519
like in the vegetation stage that it's

1175
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:59,599
just a overall weak plant they'll kill

1176
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:02,079
it off then i actually did a fetal

1177
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,440
hunting talk with northwest jay on this

1178
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,960
podcast as well i think it was like

1179
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,400
episode number five or episode six or

1180
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,000
something like that and he was talking

1181
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,440
about how he's never killed off a female

1182
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,519
plan he's always done the same thing you

1183
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,838
do which is let it grow all the way till

1184
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,519
the end harvest dry cure

1185
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:18,000
then consume and then kind of make his

1186
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:19,599
decision there so yeah that's

1187
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,639
a couple different ways to go about it

1188
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,240
for sure

1189
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,838
depends on who you are kind of what

1190
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:25,598
you're looking for within the plant on

1191
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:27,519
whether or not you're going to kill off

1192
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,440
plants at all or if you're just going to

1193
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,119
let them kind of grow through

1194
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,960
my next question which you kind of

1195
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,119
already touched on a little bit do you

1196
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,838
select just one

1197
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,519
pheno that is a keeper or multiple

1198
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,199
phenos and you kind of already mentioned

1199
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:43,519
that you know you go through the first

1200
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:46,000
run you'll have multiple keepers you'll

1201
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,199
put them through a next run as well are

1202
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,519
you going through these multiple rounds

1203
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,399
at what point you know that this is the

1204
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:52,239
one

1205
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,480
all other females that i've been working

1206
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,078
with are going to get killed off it's

1207
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,320
crazy man it's only been more recently

1208
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,640
with the new genetics like the last time

1209
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,599
i remember the last genetics that i

1210
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:02,879
popped

1211
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,440
that

1212
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,838
there was a clear winner and clear knot

1213
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,119
was tga sub cool where i was like i mean

1214
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:10,559
they're all good but this is like this

1215
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,400
is obviously the one they're talking

1216
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:13,759
about this is the vortex this is it you

1217
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,400
know what i'm saying like boom boom boom

1218
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,480
we're good as we're now it's like

1219
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,160
the stability of a lot of the genetics

1220
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,480
it's not always a bad thing but it's

1221
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:23,838
like there's so many variations that i

1222
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,920
find within these where i'm like man

1223
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:27,358
that's so different like it's nothing

1224
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,800
like this yet the plant looks the same

1225
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:31,519
but the flavor isn't even in the

1226
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,960
ballpark like this is gassy funky this

1227
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:34,480
is total lemon

1228
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,480
like how did they

1229
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,559
come in the same pack but they look the

1230
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,240
same so at that point it's like yeah i'm

1231
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:42,078
keeping them around but if it's like

1232
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:42,879
well this one just is a mild version of

1233
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,320
this

1234
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,400
like headbanger is a prime example

1235
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,200
headbanger was either

1236
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,039
kind of flat heavier yielder like it it

1237
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,719
looked the same but it yielded way

1238
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:55,119
better but the smell was just really

1239
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:57,279
mild same with the flavonoids and the

1240
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,838
other which was smaller yielder looked

1241
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,200
comparable in the structure but fire

1242
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:02,719
terps just

1243
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:04,078
so it was like well dead ass obvious

1244
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:06,719
which one am i going to keep as the

1245
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,680
connoisseur the one that as potent as

1246
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,959
can be that's that's my keeper so i

1247
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:12,799
think it does depend on the genetics

1248
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,480
you're dealing with these newer age ones

1249
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,240
that don't have the right cross or don't

1250
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,000
have the right testing

1251
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:20,879
you may find a few you may find like

1252
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,079
five six you know some of the older ones

1253
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,119
that have been tested and been around

1254
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,960
and been

1255
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,960
selected properly it seems like you find

1256
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,400
less dramatic shifts within those

1257
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,760
phenotypes so you won't need to keep as

1258
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,680
many there's no reason to have two that

1259
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,640
are really comparable what's the point

1260
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:34,559
you know

1261
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:35,759
i know what you mean i'm actually like i

1262
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:37,039
mentioned going through a phenol hunt

1263
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,320
right now and

1264
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:42,880
i'm looking really for a shorter plant

1265
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,880
because the brisker og side of things is

1266
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,559
very tall stretchy typical og very

1267
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,000
finicky once it gets those heavy buds

1268
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:49,920
it'll just be flopping all over the

1269
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,199
place while the pakistan valley is real

1270
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,240
short stout

1271
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:55,919
real nice bud stacking and uh kind of

1272
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:58,319
stays upright it doesn't really flop

1273
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,838
over like the like the brisker does so

1274
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,519
kind of keeping that plant short was one

1275
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:03,199
of the things i was looking at however

1276
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:04,880
in this grow i'm seeing that the ones

1277
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,358
that are a little bit taller

1278
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,599
are just packed on with trichomes so i'm

1279
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:11,119
like oh great i mean geez

1280
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,119
do i really want to go for the smaller

1281
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,880
one at this point or do i really want to

1282
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,680
look at the one you know keep the one

1283
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,880
that has the just covered in trichomes

1284
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:20,399
like there's no

1285
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,680
it's not much of a comparison now the

1286
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,838
other ones are starting to stack on

1287
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:25,039
trichomes here later on in flowering

1288
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,719
which i thought was pretty interesting

1289
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:28,639
but like right off the bat this

1290
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:30,959
particular female just stacked with

1291
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:31,920
trichomes and it really

1292
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,199
made me

1293
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,559
question whether or not i'm going to

1294
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:37,199
keep the shorter one out of the bunch

1295
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,799
just because it's it's shorter right

1296
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:40,399
because the trichome production i mean

1297
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,440
that's something that is more important

1298
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,639
for me

1299
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,400
of course when i'm gonna go through

1300
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:46,159
smoking them all consuming them all and

1301
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,599
so on and so forth but uh

1302
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:49,039
it was kind of interesting how things

1303
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,880
kind of flip-flopped a little bit for me

1304
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:53,679
as i'm going through the hunt yeah well

1305
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,240
like it that's the big thing too is

1306
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:58,000
as a connoisseur i kind of like the the

1307
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,078
fact that i can get two

1308
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,159
two holographics in my pokemon card so

1309
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,920
to speak in my pokemon pack as where

1310
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:05,199
before you each get in one you know so

1311
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,119
it's like saying with seeds we'll say

1312
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:09,919
that's my analogy for you nerds out

1313
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:12,318
there um is is you can have

1314
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,519
more really cool options in one pack

1315
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:15,279
we're spending that kind of money on

1316
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:16,480
these that's kind of cool man like

1317
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,599
people will be like oh which one did you

1318
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,760
get you get the one that lean more

1319
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,359
brisker or like that's that's cool then

1320
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,520
you'd eventually have a cut that's like

1321
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:25,358
oh this is the particular cut of this

1322
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,358
because there's two or three highly

1323
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,799
sought after phenotypes in here like i

1324
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:30,000
think that's really cool in my opinion

1325
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,400
versus like

1326
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,159
duh duh duh duh dank

1327
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,599
like that's what i'm more used to with a

1328
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,039
lot back in the day and while those are

1329
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,800
usually more

1330
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:40,079
stable so to speak that's what people

1331
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,599
will scream about

1332
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,160
as a kind of sewer man i like to have

1333
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,400
some variations i think it's cool yeah i

1334
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:48,239
agree with you so there are so many new

1335
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,079
growers that are coming onto the market

1336
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,039
today you know starting to grow i mean

1337
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,640
we've got

1338
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:54,000
rhode island that just legalized for

1339
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:55,679
example there's gonna be a whole bunch

1340
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,599
of people from rhode island coming on to

1341
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,759
grow and they're gonna start phenol

1342
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,280
hunting so we have a lot of beginner

1343
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,160
phenol huntings that are tuning into

1344
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,240
this podcast today what advice you have

1345
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,879
for someone who's new to fetal hunting

1346
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:11,598
labeling make sure you label properly

1347
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,599
it's so crucial so important you'll be

1348
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,039
so bummed out when you're like oh man i

1349
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,280
didn't label this funeral right and that

1350
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:18,960
was the best one like it could be this

1351
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,560
or it's this and it takes three more

1352
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,079
cycles to find out

1353
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:23,119
you gotta run them all again to be like

1354
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,039
ah

1355
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,240
i don't know well it cuts a cut like you

1356
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:27,199
won't know until part way through the

1357
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:29,039
growth and then you're seeing some

1358
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,358
characteristics but how familiar are you

1359
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:34,239
with that plant when you just ran it for

1360
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:36,960
a final you know i've lost some great

1361
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:38,959
great phenotypes great ones by being a

1362
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,159
[ __ ] and doing too much at once doing

1363
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,240
three hunts with 10 packs or 10 per pack

1364
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:45,598
each and so i'm documenting all these

1365
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:47,919
different phenotypes and just trying to

1366
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,000
find if it's male or female let alone

1367
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,599
the characteristics of what i want to

1368
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,880
keep or what i don't want to keep

1369
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,559
there's too many variables that come

1370
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,480
into play so if you don't properly

1371
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:58,480
document and and

1372
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,920
track things as you're wasting your time

1373
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,079
you just you just grow a lot of seeds

1374
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,358
that's all how do you physically label

1375
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,480
the plants there are different ways to

1376
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:06,000
do it some people have those like

1377
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,960
plastic tags that actually wrap around

1378
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,480
the branches some people just do the

1379
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,559
plant tags that you write on and stick

1380
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,480
within the soil what i'm doing this

1381
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,078
round is i took a sharpie and wrote on

1382
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,079
some painters tape and then stuck it to

1383
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,480
the side of my plastic grill pod

1384
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,480
how do you label your plants the ladder

1385
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,800
that's that's what i do oh ghetto good

1386
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,400
old-fashioned tape and well it sometimes

1387
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,800
leaves an ugly mark on your pot for me

1388
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,440
it's very easily visible to see i'm like

1389
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,280
boom boom boom all right boom and for me

1390
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,280
right now my left side is all chilled oh

1391
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,200
g's of my tent so i know these are

1392
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,040
chillato g's so i look for a b c you

1393
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:40,879
know easy there now i've only got a and

1394
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:42,960
b which worked out because those are the

1395
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,440
two i like the most and

1396
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,358
i don't have as much of an issue when i

1397
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,119
organize it properly in that sense now

1398
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,199
not only will it be visibly right there

1399
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,039
but i have it in my phone just in case

1400
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:54,559
humidity or some sort of thing happens

1401
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:56,639
the tape falls off

1402
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,239
whatever i just know that i mean they're

1403
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:00,078
in trellis so they're not moving they're

1404
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:01,439
being scrogged like not fully scrub

1405
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,200
these are just being trellised my other

1406
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,920
side's being more of a screen and green

1407
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,279
technique and i know left over here

1408
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,720
right over here it's like battle

1409
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,160
battleship you know battlefield

1410
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:12,399
battleship i know that in this

1411
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:14,159
coordinate over here this is this ship

1412
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,240
this one over here this is the ship

1413
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:17,920
meaning you know the chill at ogs so

1414
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:19,759
i've got my process down but when you're

1415
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,039
doing a bunch at once

1416
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,440
and you're moving stuff around and

1417
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:24,800
they're not all stationary like very

1418
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,559
visible i think honestly probably

1419
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,720
putting them right around the the stem

1420
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:29,838
or the branch itself for the some people

1421
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:31,838
on the branch the side like an apple

1422
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:32,960
tree or they'll do it around the the

1423
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:35,920
base

1424
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,199
of the i'm just pretty medicated we'll

1425
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,720
say i can't even think of the word the

1426
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:42,159
stem

1427
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:44,078
stock stock samsung stock

1428
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:46,559
and then you talked about

1429
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,240
documenting it and

1430
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,920
i'm sure you have some sort of you talk

1431
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:52,639
about the columns so is it like a

1432
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,000
spreadsheet that you have on your phone

1433
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:56,400
like google sheets or something like

1434
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,639
that or like what is your

1435
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,039
doc like tracking document look like so

1436
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:02,559
on uh evernote you can add tables

1437
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:04,000
evernote's a free program or you could

1438
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:05,519
do the premium version i have premium

1439
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,358
because i use it for business

1440
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:10,079
but you can have a table that you set up

1441
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:12,239
and then you could do a b c d e f g

1442
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,599
one two three four five six seven eight

1443
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:14,719
boom boom boom boom and lay them out

1444
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,760
like that so that's usually i'll do it

1445
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:17,279
visibly

1446
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,359
or visually like that so that way it's

1447
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,640
easy for me to just pop it and look doom

1448
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:23,119
good to go and that's linked to my

1449
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:25,679
google keep which says vino hunting i

1450
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,358
just click that opens up evernote

1451
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:29,519
boom it's right there and then that kind

1452
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:32,159
of correlates with my cloner so i can

1453
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,920
see the cloner set up there and then

1454
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:35,440
basically in that

1455
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,400
like the numbers and letters the first

1456
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,519
ones are always going to be the ones

1457
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,880
that are actually in those letters the

1458
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:40,639
other ones are going to be my grow text

1459
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,079
because i don't have abc

1460
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:44,719
in the grote i just know that it's laid

1461
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,400
out one two three four five six seven

1462
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:48,000
eight usually i do eight my four by

1463
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,119
eight then i'll do four in my four by

1464
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,960
four so these are in a b c d

1465
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,960
so it's pretty for me it's simple i used

1466
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,318
to do color coordinating and then i was

1467
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,519
doing way too much phenohunting and i

1468
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:59,440
couldn't get enough colors i'm like why

1469
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:02,159
can't we get like an auburn

1470
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,679
or like a lime green so i can you know

1471
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,078
differentiate all the stuff but it's

1472
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:08,239
it's not easy man it's not easy mine's

1473
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,400
pretty similar to what you imagine i use

1474
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:13,118
google sheets which another free program

1475
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,880
similar to microsoft excel

1476
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,519
and on the

1477
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,760
columns so up top i actually have the

1478
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:22,559
plant so whatever plant number it is for

1479
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,240
example and then on the rows going down

1480
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:26,000
would be the date

1481
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:27,358
and then uh and i'm just basically

1482
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,639
looking at the date and then scrolling

1483
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:30,239
across to whatever plant and then

1484
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:32,078
entering in my notes

1485
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:34,399
what are some of the things that you

1486
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,880
log like are you tracking you know

1487
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,400
feedings are you doing ph ppm are you

1488
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,039
doing transplant dates like what are you

1489
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,200
putting on that log i usually do feeding

1490
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:44,000
on there so like if i'm doing

1491
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,519
uh

1492
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,838
for a long time i'd do like three times

1493
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:49,838
a week i'd feed but in the past

1494
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:52,000
year i've been feeding every time i

1495
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:53,440
water other than one time it's like if

1496
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,280
it's i go in the room and it seems like

1497
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,440
really dry and then like the humidity

1498
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,599
fluctuates here in michigan often so at

1499
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,000
that point i'll change it but i notice

1500
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,440
that the plant if it's having any signs

1501
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,400
of stress that's when i'll market it's

1502
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,480
like all right well i'm switching to

1503
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,838
flowering nutrients let's mark it let's

1504
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,920
see how it's going to do

1505
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:11,358
oftentimes with those ones i don't have

1506
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,440
to put anything back there again unless

1507
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:14,639
it shows stress but at least have it

1508
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,159
marked so i can go back and say all

1509
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:17,838
right at this time and it shows the last

1510
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,799
time the document was edited or it was

1511
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:23,279
modified on evernote so i'm like this

1512
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,880
date did this here okay clearly that was

1513
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,880
the problem it's very obvious to see

1514
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,480
like you know i consume a lot of my

1515
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,280
products so sometimes i forget gotta go

1516
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,039
back and check awesome cool i think that

1517
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,800
gives a pretty good picture of how you

1518
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:36,480

1519

1520
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,599
