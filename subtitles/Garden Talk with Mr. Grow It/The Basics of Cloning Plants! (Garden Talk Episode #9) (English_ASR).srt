1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,919
i don't actually use water in my cloning

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,240
process because

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,000
i'm pretty assembly line with it when i

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,719
take clones it's

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,120
in in you know to where they're going

6
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:16,320
the only thing i do after my 45 degree

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:18,960
angle is a light light abrasion

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,240
actually upward on the kind of

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,278
surrounding stem

10
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:26,000
area from that 45 degree angle and even

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:29,198
with aeroponics if i wait too long and i

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,399
mess around and i have hydro plants

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,039
that transition into my cocoa blend with

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,799
peat

15
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,399
is a little bit of you know they get a

16
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,320
little wonky on me you know they might

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,280
shoot a yellow leaf or two they might

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,520
get a little

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,439
upset with me it's the quickest way if

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,239
you can get it dialed in if you

21
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,640
if it's not dialed in and you're having

22
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:48,479
fluctuation

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,600
and everything it can be a headache and

24
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,000
make you feel like you don't know what

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,000
you're doing

yeah so uh i'm trey

102
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,039
i'm passionate about family cannabis and

103
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:29,518
culinary

104
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:34,158
um so all subsets of my life come

105
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:37,439
from those passions and obviously

106
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:40,318
is why i have been dedicated to

107
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,000
cannabis lifestyle and canvas lifestyle

108
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,839
tv and all the things that have branched

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,120
off from that but really i've

110
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,080
always from my first interaction with

111
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,400
the plant i've

112
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,840
been like the plant not necessarily the

113
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,400
flower but the plant

114
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,400
have been

115
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,519
fascinated by it i guess you know it's

116
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,360
like the closest thing

117
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:06,480
to a hobby

118
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,920
that i have but for the longest time it

119
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,280
wasn't really you know something you

120
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:12,878
outwardly was like yeah my hobby is

121
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,840
growing cannabis you know

122
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,319
um it's cool to say that i've i think i

123
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,639
can

124
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,120
proudly say that we've been a part a

125
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,120
small part in that footstep of like

126
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,319
breaking the stigma and having it be

127
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,000
kind of

128
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:30,879
somewhat normalcy to you know have that

129
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,600
small at-home garden and just figure out

130
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,040
on how

131
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,960
different ways to tweak it and make it

132
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,800
better um

133
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,560
which is what i've been doing for the

134
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,000
past decade so

135
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,199
yeah i mean i that's me in a nutshell as

136
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,519
far as cannabis and

137
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,439
and you know obviously if any of you

138
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,240
have you know watched the channel you

139
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,199
know

140
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,759
um i have a good a great relationship

141
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,919
with

142
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,840
culinary which i've melded with cannabis

143
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,359
many many times over which i also feel

144
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,359
like is

145
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,400
another subset of those two passions of

146
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,400
mine so

147
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,758
and you also have a hydroponic store is

148
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:07,038
that right

149
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,080
yeah we uh north shore is hydroponic

150
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,199
and holland hydroponic outlet one in the

151
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,000
same

152
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,639
we're located in the west michigan area

153
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,478
west west

154
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,560
west coast area so

155
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:21,758
yeah we got four locations along along

156
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,639
like a 60-mile strip

157
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,479
so we've been helping people stores been

158
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,319
around 11 years i've been a part of it

159
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:32,240
for about seven

160
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,879
and that'll put you through the trenches

161
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,000
you know

162
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,399
of just like even if i wasn't growing

163
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,319
kind of the do's and don'ts and

164
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:45,599
the the wii's and won'ts you know so

165
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,839
that's been it's like an apprenticeship

166
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,360
almost in a sense again because you are

167
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,638
in a time that it wasn't as trendy as it

168
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,759
is now

169
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,519
um so i you know of course you you

170
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,520
have those instances where

171
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,319
you know people are kind of driven for

172
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,120
one sense or another uh

173
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,680
towards gardening and so you find that

174
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,199
kind of

175
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,519
ugly side of it but there's a really

176
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,840
great gardening community

177
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:19,279
out of it as well and i think what's

178
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,119
cool and i'm sure it's like that with

179
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,478
like the automotive community or

180
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,879
any niche uh interest right

181
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,758
is um you kind of have to work your way

182
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,560
into it

183
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,759
and and and your name is really all you

184
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,800
have to go by

185
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:38,080
is what the community says you

186
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,680
are good at or not so good at so

187
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:44,800
i haven't had too many bad reviews

188
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,360
in the sense of that community so

189
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,319
for me that's a sense of pride for sure

190
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,439
and

191
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,520
you know i think that's why people come

192
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,959
back to us because you can get you can

193
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,598
get gardening grow equipment from

194
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,159
anywhere

195
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,560
um but the knowledge that you seek for

196
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,199
your garden at the time of need

197
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,079
you know that's what makes you so much

198
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,439
of an influence

199
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,560
on not only youtube but just the growing

200
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,519
community

201
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,519
and you know that's what's going to kind

202
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,839
of speak volumes over time

203
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,560
that makes sense cool all right let's

204
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,038
get into the

205
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,319
topic today so let's talk all about

206
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,079
cloning

207
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,360
so i have a variety of people that watch

208
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,439
my channel right beginners

209
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,680
intermediate advanced i feel like it's

210
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,120
more geared towards

211
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,959
i feel like a majority of the audience

212
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,240
are beginner-like so

213
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,159
in this episode i really just want to

214
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,598
kind of cover the basics maybe we can

215
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,039
get into more advanced things in a

216
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,918
different episode

217
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,240
but let's cover the basics so um first

218
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:43,359
off

219
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,360
what is cloning well

220
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:51,038
it's essentially uh keeping around

221
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,919
whatever form of plant you have um

222
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,038
and essentially by cutting off a piece

223
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:57,439
of that plant and

224
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,399
and trying to have that established

225
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,160
roots or

226
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:04,478
you know a root zone so that you can um

227
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,280
keep keep whatever it is you got going

228
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:06,959
so

229
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:08,399
yeah i think that's in the simplest form

230
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,318
cutting off a branch

231
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,079
and rooting it is really what it comes

232
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,800
down to so

233
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,560
at what point do you clone i mean do you

234
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,160
take clones in early veg

235
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:23,199
late veg flower when do you take clones

236
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,400
um i would say

237
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,960
you know when i went that question i'm

238
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:29,198
like well like mid veg

239
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,478
that's not you know i'm not not papa

240
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,360
bear not mom and bear

241
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,240
or not baby bear a middle bear so um i

242
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,158
would say

243
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,360
i like to have a plant be well

244
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,799
established i guess

245
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,278
before i i i take a clone

246
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,958
so i would i would say i'm a mid veg not

247
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,360
early veg because

248
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,199
i feel like and they you know depending

249
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,800
on you know the resiliency of your plant

250
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,800
you may not need that long a time

251
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,639
and again depending on what kind of

252
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,759
plant you're cloning i'm sure

253
00:08:54,639 --> 00:09:01,278
everyone has a little bit different

254
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:04,240
of a sweet spot but for me i would and

255
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,278
i would say mid veg i usually do mid veg

256
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,200
as well

257
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,200
you can do it at any point right early

258
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,640
veg you can do it maybe like

259
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,720
i would say probably the earliest i

260
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,720
would ever take clowns is around day 20

261
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,560
25-ish you know i mean that would be

262
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,000
like real early to take clowns

263
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:22,319
for me you can definitely do it in

264
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,839
in late veg you can do it in flour as

265
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,440
well some people don't know that you can

266
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,920
actually take clones and flour it's

267
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,000
called

268
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,838
monster cropping and then you have to

269
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,159
actually go through the the re-vegging

270
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,320
process so it takes a little bit longer

271
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,759
to to get back into that re-vegging

272
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,600
process and take off but

273
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,519
you can certainly still take clones

274
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,120
while in the flower stage it's just

275
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,039
just not really ideal because it takes a

276
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,360
little bit longer than that so

277
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:50,399
yeah i saw that option not for me

278
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,959
not personally and we um just

279
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,039
uh touched on this actually on our live

280
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,518
i believe on tuesday

281
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,079
you know there's this if you you know it

282
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,159
can

283
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,680
again be whatever i know certain like

284
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,559
orchid strains

285
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,359
or even um there's a customer of mine

286
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,199
who

287
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,720
clones conifer trees and he gets like

288
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,560
six hundred dollars a clone and he'll

289
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,959
take like 600 clones and he'll only get

290
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,359
six

291
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,278
though you know that's like not the

292
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,039
greatest succession rate but

293
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:22,480
um i would say i just don't want to go

294
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,360
through that much time and effort and

295
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,759
energy unless

296
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,079
it's like the cream of the crop worth

297
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,679
that monster cropping and um

298
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:32,000
revenge time because the revenge time

299
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,679
can be quite a long time completely

300
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,679
agree it's situational right so some

301
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,719
people aren't going to have the space

302
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,239
um you know to have an 18 6 light cycle

303
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,360
a veg light cycle going and a flower

304
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,959
cycle so maybe they

305
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,240
they put all their plants in a flower

306
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,759
then they realize hey this fino is

307
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,360
awesome i want to keep it

308
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,879
so at that point maybe they you know

309
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,680
they cut clones at that point

310
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:53,120
um you know late flower to kind of keep

311
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,559
those genetics around so

312
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,159
yeah i agree with you it's definitely

313
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,399
situational for sure

314
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,000
so can the plant be showing deficiencies

315
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,320
when you clone it

316
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,240
well you you bring up a good adjective

317
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,440
there situational which i feel like is

318
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,680
going to be kind of

319
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,720
a couple of these answers for me um

320
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,199
which it is

321
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,000
you know again those those trench in the

322
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,800
trenches days

323
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,159
that i mentioned like just shown me like

324
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,159
really

325
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,319
and i guess that's great because we've

326
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,159
built a community and kind of a

327
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,760
existence on this but there's no one

328
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,759
answer right

329
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,078
um i i again if it's if it's a phenotype

330
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,439
or

331
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,439
a cultivar that is just

332
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,480
and i for whatever reason don't have any

333
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,120
other way to keep it around and it has

334
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,920
an issue

335
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,679
it's it's showing signs of stress it's

336
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,879
you know maybe has

337
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:44,879
some sort of pest issue

338
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,839
i'll clone it you know if it's coming to

339
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,399
kind of a tea in the road

340
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,160
if i had my you know perf if i had my

341
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,159
perfect situation

342
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,278
i would wait for it to be healthy to

343
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,240
bounce back

344
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,759
because obviously those issues are only

345
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,480
going to translate down into that

346
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,879
generation

347
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,600
and so it's going to be dang near

348
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,600
impossible to

349
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,800
kind of supersede those issues if they

350
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,800
are so severe

351
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,679
but you know if if a plant is showing me

352
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,199
signs of that

353
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,599
it's probably not something i'm keeping

354
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,120
around to be honest but again

355
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,240
depending on the situation um

356
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,039
yes but like initial answer

357
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,240
no yeah i think there's a i think that's

358
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,120
a common argument

359
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,278
is um if the plant is showing any type

360
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,320
of deficiencies it's showing a sign of

361
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:37,919
weakness

362
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,200
you don't want a clone i think general

363
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,439
knowledge is you don't want to actually

364
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,680
take clones at that point now

365
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,440
i've read quite a few books and one of

366
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,958
the things i have some notes here

367
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,000
one of the books that i've read i'm not

368
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,799
sure if you're familiar with it the

369
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,440
gross bible

370
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,319
jorge cevantes grow his bible so

371
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,680
actually in

372
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,120
that one quote clones

373
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,599
quickly develop a root system when the

374
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,078
stems have a high carbohydrate and low

375
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,040
nitrogen concentration so there is an

376
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:04,838
eye game out there that

377
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,719
if you're a little bit deficient in

378
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,279
nitrogen you're actually going to root

379
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,639
faster

380
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:10,078
which i thought was really interesting

381
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,519
now i've never put it to the test i

382
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,599
haven't done any side by sides or

383
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,600
anything like that but

384
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,519
you know for those people who think that

385
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,040
any sign of deficiencies

386
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,799
is a weakness and you shouldn't clone at

387
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,240
that point there is actually some

388
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,240
evidence out there or

389
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,759
people out there experts in our field

390
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,919
out there that are saying that

391
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,360
if it's a little bit deficient you know

392
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:30,479
particularly nitrogen

393
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,639
that's actually a good thing and

394
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,159
actually speed up rooting well

395
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,680
and i was going to say when sometimes

396
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,278
when you take a clone they will

397
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,958
obviously show signs of nitrogen

398
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:42,559
deficiency so almost

399
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:46,000
having a plant that might already be

400
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,399
established to that you know might do

401
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,360
well

402
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,360
you know because depending on you know

403
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,879
the length of time it takes your

404
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,959
plant to develop roots you know it

405
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,639
usually you're not hitting it with a

406
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,719
bunch of food it's not having a

407
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,079
bunch of access to resource necessarily

408
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,560
so you know

409
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,159
it's almost like you know a kid that's

410
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,078
been in the streets already

411
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,159
you know so it's like they're going to

412
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:13,120
survive a little bit better you know

413
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:16,319
i guess i've done no side by sides but i

414
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,159
have been in that situation where

415
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,240
actually a couple months ago i had i

416
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,879
didn't have to shut down the garden but

417
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,399
i had to revamp it and i had some

418
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:28,078
genetics that i wanted to keep around

419
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,639
but they were a little stressed because

420
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,120
i was

421
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,879
pretty focused on my greenhouse at the

422
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,039
time and so

423
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,399
you know i took those plants that

424
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,838
weren't so great and i

425
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,958
cloned them out just to keep the um

426
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,480
cultivars around and

427
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,518
they cloned so i i mean you know jorge

428
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,839
knows

429
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,839
quite a bit i i'm familiar with the

430
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,199
bible i've obviously referenced it a ton

431
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,279
i think it's like the bible i haven't

432
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:58,639
run it from like cover to cover but

433
00:14:55,278 --> 00:15:00,320
you know i've definitely referenced it

434
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,519
and that's interesting i mean you don't

435
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,278
think about these things

436
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,720
that you've done necessarily in the in

437
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,360
the garden until you

438
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,160
you know are talking about it so makes

439
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,480
sense

440
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,000
now for probably one of the most uh

441
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,680
beginner questions

442
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,278
very common beginner questions i guess

443
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:19,120
i'll say

444
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,120
can you clone an autoflower plan

445
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,720
oh yeah i went into my own conversation

446
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,360
with this question like

447
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,920
off camera well first of all

448
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,120
um autoflowers man i was gonna say

449
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,360
because i've never done autoflowers

450
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,959
because

451
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,839
that's my initial like nope don't do

452
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:40,638
that you know don't grow that here

453
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,519
um tough

454
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,600
man i have done them the ones that i've

455
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,879
grown i have not been very impressed

456
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,240
with they were just kind of there and

457
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,278
they did their thing

458
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,198
i have done a couple sun grown as well

459
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,278
um and where that's where i feel like

460
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:58,479
they have the most value

461
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:01,679
personally for the region in which i

462
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,278
uh grow as well as the type of gardener

463
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,879
that i am

464
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:09,278
um i've heard of people doing it

465
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,958
i haven't personally done it i don't

466
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:12,559
personally run autoflowers

467
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,919
i'm gonna try to get better with that

468
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,439
because they didn't they haven't

469
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,278
actually done anything to me personally

470
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,040
but it kind of feels like it because

471
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,720
when you dedicate time and energy to a

472
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,399
plan and it comes out like charlie brown

473
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,519
christmas tree you're like what the heck

474
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,120
is going on here but that's uh kind of

475
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,560
what i

476
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,480
you know i'm that's the type of guy i am

477
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,479
too like

478
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,600
i didn't do so well with him i will

479
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,680
probably

480
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,959
pick up that challenge again you know if

481
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,000
the situation

482
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:42,719
uh opens itself to it but

483
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,440
as far as me cloning autoflowers no i

484
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,440
have not

485
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,759
can you there has been people out there

486
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,480
that have successfully done so

487
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,680
i don't believe that that's what they

488
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,039
were

489
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:57,838
inceptionalized to do though they were

490
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,399
they were developed to do exactly the

491
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,079
opposite

492
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:04,798
of that to to to be planted to grow

493
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,000
to bloom and to die that is what they're

494
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,639
meant to do

495
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,439
how you tweak that cycle is very

496
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,799
pertinent

497
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,720
and i haven't gotten it down yet

498
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,240
personally so um

499
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,759
but there are gardeners out there i have

500
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,400
a couple customers that that's all they

501
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,000
grow and

502
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,839
and they love it and they're they're

503
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,558
doing pretty well from what i can see

504
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,279
so yeah i think technically you can um

505
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:25,759
you can

506
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,879
clone an autoflower plant now is it

507
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,480
ideal to do that

508
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,559
are you going to get a great result you

509
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,679
can get a high yield high yield from

510
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:32,798
doing that

511
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,000
probably not right because if you're

512
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,240
cutting a clone say you cut a clone

513
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,839
around day 25 right

514
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,679
typical autoflower is going to start

515
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:43,279
flowering around what day 30

516
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,960
day 40 or so it's on that a certain life

517
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,399
span right

518
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,759
it's not like you control the amount of

519
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,519
time it's in veg

520
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:52,960
by the light cycle like you do with

521
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:54,798
photo period plants right so

522
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,079
if you're cutting a clone around day 25

523
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:57,759
off an auto power plant

524
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,119
you can get it to root for sure you can

525
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,240
get it to root

526
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,759
now the thing is it's going to be

527
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,960
flowering pretty quickly because it's

528
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,279
not sensitive to that

529
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,640
it's not you know photoperiodism so you

530
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,720
might have a small plant

531
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,799
so then it's like well is it even worth

532
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,798
it to clone autos or not

533
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,079
so technically it's possible but yeah

534
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:15,038
you got to ask yourself is it is it

535
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,319
really worth the time

536
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,679
is it really worth you know the space

537
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:21,599
maybe it is for some people i'd love to

538
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,679
know for those who are viewing this have

539
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,038
you cloned an autoflower plant before

540
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,640
is that something that you practice let

541
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,000
me know let us know down in the comment

542
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,160
section below

543
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,759
i'd love to hear it i'm sure we'll hear

544
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,720
somebody that says oh yeah i clone all

545
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:35,519
the time

546
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,038
yeah yeah i mean there are those not

547
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,759
anomalies in the system but like i say

548
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:39,679
there's

549
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,519
gardeners out there that make things

550
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,798
happen that i don't see

551
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,440
in the the mass percentage or popularity

552
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,960
but it's

553
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,600
definitely you know done for sure

554
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,038
so when you do cut clones does the clone

555
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,798
need to be a certain size

556
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:56,558
do you have like do you cut a certain

557
00:18:54,798 --> 00:19:00,960
size of a clone

558
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:00,960
or what um

559
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:07,038
yes would be like my golden boy answer

560
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:13,279
but like do they vary

561
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,079
yes as you heard me mentioned a couple

562
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,000
minutes ago

563
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,678
i've taken whole plants and turned them

564
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,200
all into clones so that

565
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,038
you know the side the size

566
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,080
differentiation there is going

567
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:27,679
to vary um

568
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:30,480
ideally um when i clone i take

569
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,440
same size clones so that they all grow

570
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,360
evenly

571
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:38,960
um is my thought process behind that

572
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:41,918
or why i do it in that method

573
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,960
but it kind of varies too if i have

574
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,038
different

575
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,279
phenotypes or cultivars next to each

576
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:50,558
other in the same cloning bed

577
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:53,519
then they vary no matter what

578
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:54,639
size i take them at you know certain

579
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,759
genetics are going to

580
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:01,120
root faster and grow quicker

581
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:01,919
i had some plants that were in my

582
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,599
aeroponic clone

583
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,000
that pretty much turned into hydroponic

584
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:09,038
plants so it's um

585
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,480
it's not impossible uh to to have

586
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:12,720
success i would say

587
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,759
uh without keeping it the same size i

588
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,720
think it helps you

589
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:18,079
if you try to um just like in cooking

590
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,240
you know you want to cut things to the

591
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:23,359
same size so that they all cook evenly

592
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,839
when you have it more uh kind of rough

593
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,119
it's going to cook that same way so

594
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,279
that's a good answer i think for me

595
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,439
generally what i'll do is

596
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,359
you know roughly maybe six to eight

597
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,080
inches is what i'll cut

598
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,599
for a clone roughly now there are people

599
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,599
but people out there who have

600
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,038
cut off two foot branches and then clone

601
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:42,000
that i mean it's possible right you can

602
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,200
do that

603
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,558
i i have i have it depends on if i'm

604
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,679
breaking down a plant

605
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,079
if i you know just trying to to take an

606
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,919
even

607
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:53,759
i i try to be even about it but it's

608
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,480
situational again i'm going to

609
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,679
steal that word from you for this

610
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,279
episode but

611
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:04,640
yeah i i try to i usually will cut

612
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:07,200
like a decent size off of the plant

613
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,000
and then shorten that into a clone so i

614
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,558
go for fairly that same size but they

615
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,319
some of them vary you know got it now i

616
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,798
know you said that you've taken

617
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,918
clones from an entire plant before right

618
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:19,599
but generally

619
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,440
what part of the plant you take clones

620
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,519
from my

621
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,759
entryway into cloning was you know

622
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:29,279
bottom of the bottom of the canopy

623
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,000
you know or lower half of the plant and

624
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:34,240
so that's where

625
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,919
i try to start at but sometimes

626
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,159
i would say sometimes majority of the

627
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,038
time when i'm taking clones i'll look at

628
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,360
that plant and then

629
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:42,879
also start to like prune that plant so

630
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:44,719
if there are

631
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,640
certain branches that i'm going to

632
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,519
discard anyway they might become a clone

633
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,880
in the process

634
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,158
so there are those times but most of the

635
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,120
time it's because i'm

636
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,159
snipping you know clones off of that

637
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,199
branch already

638
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,760
so usually the lower half of the plant i

639
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,880
would say

640
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:05,119
is like my 80 go-to unless i'm

641
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,159
breaking down a whole plant got it yeah

642
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:07,678
so you can definitely

643
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,120
um you know just back up a minute you

644
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,640
can definitely take clones from any part

645
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,158
of the plant if you want

646
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,159
but i am going to actually quote jorge

647
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,320
cervantes again you know in his book he

648
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,679
has just this section on cloning and

649
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:18,879
i remember when i first read it i was

650
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,559
like wow i didn't know this i didn't

651
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,440
know this i didn't know this

652
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,960
and and one of the things was clones

653
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,279
from the lower branches

654
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,600
root the easiest because they contain

655
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,879
more of the proper hormones

656
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,558
so that's what it says in there so

657
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,080
basically the lower part of the plant is

658
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:35,359
apparently the easiest to root has the

659
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:37,279
newest hormones

660
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,599
middle part of the plant easier easier

661
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,960
to root next to oldest hormones and then

662
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,199
upper part of the plant

663
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,480
most difficult clones to root oldest

664
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,360
hormones that's coming straight out of

665
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,640
his book so

666
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,479
i thought it was interesting i figured

667
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,320
i'd bring that up i'm not sure if a lot

668
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,480
of people know that or not

669
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:55,439
um there is some stuff in his book

670
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,839
that's inaccurate so

671
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,798
i can't say that this is 100 accurate

672
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,918
but um

673
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:01,519
yeah that's what it says in there which

674
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,919
i thought was interesting right now

675
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:03,440
there's

676
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,200
there's so much information out there

677
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,400
and i i think too again

678
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,640
because i grew my i

679
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,960
in gardening terms i grew up off of

680
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,440
jorge cervantes and ed rosenstein

681
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,480
and guys who learned strictly off of

682
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,720
them

683
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,798
um but again that was a different time

684
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,038
that was you know almost two decades ago

685
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,798
so i think there's just been so much

686
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:28,240
more revelation and

687
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:30,798
information and science done um that

688
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,359
any plant you know that that cuts across

689
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,158
more than

690
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:35,599
just ones we may be talking about um

691
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,200
it's

692
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,759
there's a lot of things like you say

693
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,400
that can be inaccurate now or debunked

694
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:44,319
in a sense but um because that same

695
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,278
thing i've had clones root from the top

696
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,439
of the plant

697
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:48,839
did they take a little bit longer i mean

698
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,798
i didn't take a record of it but

699
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:52,959
probably so

700
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:54,960
interesting stuff now when you cut the

701
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,960
clones a common technique is to cut it

702
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,079
at a 45 degree angle

703
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:03,120
do you do that at all or i do

704
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:06,000
yes that's

705
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:08,079
you know when i go to take that longer

706
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,319
piece of the plant and i snip it down

707
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:14,158
that's when i make my 45 degree angle

708
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:16,240
and the benefit of that is the only

709
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,919
information bank i have is from my

710
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,319
mother

711
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,240
who ran a floral shot for many many

712
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,879
moons many many moons before i was a

713
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,240
thing

714
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,200
and where i get a lot of my

715
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,919
kind of green thumb from and every time

716
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,558
she would

717
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,320
bring for us flowers into the house

718
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:36,158
which she always had to have

719
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:39,119
she would always cut it at that same 45

720
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,200
degree angle you know every single stem

721
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:42,158
and i think you know it does expose

722
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,159
surface area

723
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,960
but how she explained it to me is there

724
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,679
a for for those plants that they were

725
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,880
able to

726
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,480
more readily uh drink or eat or like

727
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,320
go for resource in the base that they

728
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,919
were in

729
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,399
i think the same thing applies when

730
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,080
you're talking about taking a clone is

731
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,240
you wanting a fresh as

732
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,359
most as you can get it as close as you

733
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,278
can get a sterile

734
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:06,479
part to that plant to start that root

735
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,919
zone from

736
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,839
um so that's my two cents

737
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,520
now there's a common technique of

738
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:17,359
basically at the end of the clone

739
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:19,440
to split the end uh and it supposedly

740
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,759
gets more roots that way that's a common

741
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,519
thing

742
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,599
another thing would be to scrape off

743
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,000
like the inch or two

744
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,359
of the bottom of the clone again to kind

745
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,400
of help with surface area help with

746
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,599
rooting do you do any of those

747
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,600
techniques at all or

748
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:35,439
i do not and and i

749
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,759
and there's nothing wrong with it i

750
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,440
think people do

751
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:40,798
there's definitely gardeners out there

752
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,720
who get success

753
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:47,440
from doing that i

754
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,159
i wasn't ever taught that from my kind

755
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:53,120
of obi-wan

756
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:55,760
into into gardening um but also

757
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,319
i just i the time or two that i've done

758
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,158
it it's

759
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,240
so much stress on the clone that i

760
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,000
haven't seen good results come back from

761
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,359
it i haven't seen it

762
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,159
be beneficial to one my rooting time

763
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,278
or two just overall health of the plant

764
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,760
um

765
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:12,798
i have had a couple people help me clone

766
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,919
and when they

767
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:20,000
they've gone to do that and i'm like oh

768
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:23,600
it's like pretty nerve-wracking um but

769
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,278
no i i i the only thing i do after my 45

770
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,719
degree angle is a light

771
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:32,720
light abrasion um actually upward

772
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,759
on the um kind of surrounding stem

773
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,120
area from that 45 degree angle

774
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:42,798
and then i dip into my

775
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:46,000
rooting hormone a rooting compound and

776
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:49,519
um go from there so

777
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,759
uh yeah that's worked for me

778
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:56,720
it's it's i think it's just enough

779
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,640
ruffling on that edge to get that oh

780
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,880
crap we need energy here

781
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,799
which is what you're creating when you

782
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,520
when you take that clone

783
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,639
um but it's not so much that it's hard

784
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,278
for the plant or

785
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,960
for the potential plant to recover got

786
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:11,359
it yeah i usually i usually scrape the

787
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,400
bottom

788
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,918
inch or two at the very bottom um

789
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,278
you know the hopes that the roots would

790
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,799
be popping out of that place i've seen

791
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:20,159
them i've seen it happen before you know

792
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:21,359
as they ripped out you can see roots

793
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,278
coming out that way so

794
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:24,558
i think it's beneficial so that's that's

795
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:26,319
typically what i do

796
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:27,278
i don't think i've ever from when i can

797
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:29,038
remember i don't think i've ever done

798
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,798
the split at the end

799
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:32,640
um i don't think i've ever done it

800
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:34,319
before but maybe i have i don't know

801
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,080
well yeah every single plan i've grown

802
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,319
every single thing i've done

803
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:39,678
right exactly we didn't we weren't

804
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,759
recording every single

805
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,399
time that we did it we were just i mean

806
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,079
a lot of my early garden career was

807
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:47,678
throwing crap at the wall and hoping

808
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:51,119
that what it stuck

809
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,519
but it's um i think we can both agree

810
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:53,678
that

811
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,720
the scraping of the light abrasion is

812
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,640
beneficial

813
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,399
um how you go about that i guess i

814
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,240
wouldn't say i the only thing i would

815
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,079
say i don't do personally is like

816
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,880
completely scrape it down to kind of the

817
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:05,519
meat

818
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,120
which is what i think could be

819
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,759
translated from the question

820
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,359
um not that you can't do it you know

821
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,038
plants are pretty freaking resilient

822
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,158
it's kind of crazy what they go through

823
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:16,079
with what we put them through or

824
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,080
otherwise so you can

825
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:19,839
do it successfully i think as far as

826
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,158
like cutting into that

827
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,359
like upwardly and not just doing the

828
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,240
scrape or doing both

829
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:26,639
but i think favoring one or the other

830
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,159
you know

831
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,000
it's just a lot for the plant to recover

832
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,240
from nafta cut the clone

833
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,319
it's generally advised i mean just about

834
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,599
any resource you read online it's

835
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,000
advised to

836
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:40,000
immediately put that clone into water is

837
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,159
that something that you do

838
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,038
you know what are the reasons why to

839
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,720
potentially

840
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:49,038
dip it immediately into water um

841
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,480
i got the answer here if you need me to

842
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:53,200
give it to you

843
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,519
yeah go ahead and give it to me all

844
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,720
right

845
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,798
um so you want to prevent air from

846
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,000
getting into those hollow stems

847
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,839
it's called embolism so basically it's a

848
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,798
bubble of air that gets trapped in the

849
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,798
stem

850
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,079
when that happens fluid stops and then

851
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:09,679
the clone dies

852
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,199
so that's why it's generally advised to

853
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,440
just stick that clone directly into

854
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,480
water to prevent that air bubble

855
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,720
from getting into the actual hollow stem

856
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,200
so that's my understanding of it yeah i

857
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,319
mean learn something new every day

858
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,600
what i know is that again it's it's

859
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,000
keeping it sterile

860
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:29,519
i guess i didn't know exactly about the

861
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,159
the air bubble

862
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,839
effect but again to me it's a

863
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,880
contaminant factor

864
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:39,678
you know and i i understood that fact of

865
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,520
um like you're taking these clones you

866
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,320
want it to be sterile from the cut

867
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:46,319
all the way until it's in whatever

868
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:50,158
medium you're putting it into

869
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,960
and that can help one of the people who

870
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,278
was helping me

871
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,640
take the clones was making the cut

872
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:57,119
actually under water

873
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,038
and you know cutting it upward and

874
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:03,759
things like that and

875
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:06,158
i just no i ain't got time

876
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:06,960
i i have success without doing all that

877
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,240
the only

878
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,278
thing i would say i use water for is if

879
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,960
i'm

880
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,919
hey these need i need to take clones of

881
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,278
these

882
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:21,278
uh cultivars so let me take the branch

883
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:24,159
off and stick them in a solo cup of ph

884
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:26,960
water until i'm able to take the clone

885
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,360
that's when i will kind of soak my cuts

886
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,440
in

887
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,359
water i don't actually use water in my

888
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,679
cloning process because

889
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:35,439
i'm pretty assembly line with it when i

890
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,000
take clones it's

891
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,159
in to in you know to where they're going

892
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,079
i don't have like a

893
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,159
a span in time where i have to

894
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,678
necessarily worry about that

895
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,120
and i know some people instead of going

896
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,240
into water instead of dipping it

897
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,278
directly into water as

898
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,278
quickly as they can they'll goes

899
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:54,960
directly into a rooting hormone

900
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:56,720
right so what is a rooting hormone uh

901
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,038
that was what i was gonna look up but i

902
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:03,200
believe it's like

903
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:05,119
in burritic acid or

904
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,480
something along those lines i mean i

905
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:12,239
know the homie goblin he uses just like

906
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,440
um aloe vera um and i know there's a

907
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,440
couple of

908
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,200
of gardeners that practice that actually

909
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,120
i know there's some people who don't use

910
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,798
a rooting hormone at all

911
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:24,239
but what is it um look it up because i i

912
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,079
know i butchered that word but

913
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,720
it's some sort of acid in in a

914
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,398
gelatinous form more or less

915
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,798
yeah quite simply it's something that's

916
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:34,798
gonna help the the clone root faster

917
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:36,319
is really what it comes down to there

918
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:38,639
are several different types

919
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:40,000
um we won't get into two details a

920
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,840
little bit more advanced but

921
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,599
naa iba dpi

922
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,278
those are three different i usually use

923
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,278
the iba ones

924
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,038
then you've got the you know the liquid

925
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:53,038
solutions versus the gel solutions

926
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:55,278
versus the powder solutions

927
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:57,919
are there any ones in particular that

928
00:31:55,278 --> 00:32:01,440
you usually do

929
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,360
oh man uh

930
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,360
i guess what also what brand now in

931
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:06,158
particular i don't have a particular

932
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:08,719
brand

933
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,600
the reason i chuckle is because certain

934
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,278
customers are so dead set on like clonex

935
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,639
oh you don't got clonex and i'll have

936
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:16,558
root tech instead

937
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,159
you know just because sometimes the

938
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:22,158
inventory varies right

939
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,799
and um it's like lucky gym socks to me

940
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,039
i'm like it's

941
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,960
it's rooting gel what is the difference

942
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:28,558
you know like when you get a new clone

943
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,399
or you get easy

944
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:32,240
or yeah easy clones version which is a

945
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:34,158
rooting compound i've tried dyna i've

946
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,919
tried root tech i've tried cloning

947
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,360
i haven't i don't think i've actually

948
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,679
ever even used

949
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:41,678
clonex cloning gel i haven't because

950
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,840
it's purple and it weirds me out

951
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:48,960
but um yeah i mean i've had success with

952
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:50,000
all the ones i've mentioned um and i

953
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,319
don't

954
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,519
i don't see a difference personally you

955
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:55,119
know coming from

956
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,640
a guy who runs a hydroshot four days out

957
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:59,199
of the week i don't

958
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,480
there's no difference to me personally i

959
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,240
think the only thing i would add to that

960
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,880
is i usually use like the the liquid of

961
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,599
the gel

962
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,799
i feel like the powder um you know

963
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:10,000
sometimes it doesn't get

964
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:13,359
directly onto the bottom of the clone as

965
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,200
nicely as the the liquid of the gel does

966
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:16,319
see i feel like that's eluded me because

967
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,960
i've had customers come in you don't

968
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:21,759
have any rooting powder and i'm like

969
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,399
no like that's a dated in my opinion

970
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:25,839
form of

971
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:26,798
of taking clones i i don't even stock a

972
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,240
rooting powder

973
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:29,599
the the closest thing to a rooting

974
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,720
powder i have is great white you know

975
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:34,319
shout out to them

976
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:38,000
and because once i dip into my rooting

977
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:41,278
um rooting hormone

978
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,159
um i then will roll my my clones into

979
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:44,319
great white

980
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,200
so it almost creates like a paste on the

981
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:48,639
end of

982
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,240
um my clone which is also

983
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,759
why i don't use any water or anything i

984
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,000
feel like everything that gets sucked up

985
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:54,720
into

986
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,200
that little situation ship right there

987
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,240
uh

988
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,080
is you know a combination of that uh

989
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,679
rooting hormone and and great white

990
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:04,798
because great white is like

991
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,080
powdered sugar it cakes okay so there's

992
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,639
several different methods

993
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:10,319
for rooting right you can simply cut the

994
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,240
clone off the plant

995
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,639
directly stick it directly into the

996
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,078
medium which i've done in the past

997
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,000
of course using you know rooting

998
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,480
hormones or what you just talked about

999
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,679
you can stick it in rock wall you can

1000
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,240
use root riots

1001
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,679
aeroponics you can actually stick that

1002
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,878
clone directly into a cup of water and

1003
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,679
leave it in the cup of water and

1004
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:31,918
actually root in that water what method

1005
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,960
do you typically use

1006
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:36,719
well i haven't ever had

1007
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,398
roots come from just sticking it in

1008
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,039
water i know people who have but

1009
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:42,159
i have not had that amount of green

1010
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:45,358
thumb action

1011
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,358
personally but other than that i've done

1012
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:50,398
them all

1013
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:51,759
well except for grow dan i haven't

1014
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:53,918
personally done it but

1015
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,280
my brother who i garden with now he he

1016
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:58,559
uses them

1017
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,040
and they're just like any other soilless

1018
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:00,480
cube

1019
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:01,838
i i think there's a little bit of

1020
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,559
technique when you're talking about

1021
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:04,559
soaking them

1022
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,079
i started my cloning career in riots or

1023
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,519
soilless peak cubes

1024
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,519
i find those to be personally one of the

1025
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:18,960
more

1026
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:18,960
beginner friendly or

1027
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:23,920
less vulnerable ways to clone

1028
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,720
personally the only difference is kind

1029
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:31,599
of how i've graduated to how i do it

1030
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:33,439
used to just

1031
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,519
take them out of the bag take the clones

1032
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,599
stick them in there and go

1033
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,920
now i will typically soak them in a

1034
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,480
solution that has some form of great

1035
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,320
white or orca

1036
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:49,599
in it because like i mentioned i do the

1037
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,680
dip and roll in my aeroponic cloning

1038
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,599
um that does not work so well when you

1039
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:55,279
go to shove something into a peak cube

1040
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,880
with a hole that's really tiny

1041
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,440
so i just make sure that the great white

1042
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:03,280
is just already absorbed into the

1043
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:06,400
puck or the peak cube

1044
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:09,440
and then go from there

1045
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,440
aeroponic cloning

1046
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,000
when she works she's a beaut when she

1047
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:17,118
doesn't it can really be

1048
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,519
a punch to the gut um that's uh

1049
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,240
my other like binary relationship with

1050
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:25,679
any kind of

1051
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:26,319
hydroponics it's like it can be great

1052
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:31,199
and

1053
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:34,240
if it's bad it can be very bad um but

1054
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:36,000
if you can get it good it is like one of

1055
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:39,118
the most streamlined ways to clone

1056
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,400
i think that they're happy that way

1057
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,519
when you're talking about the other

1058
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,838
spectrum just like taking it off of the

1059
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:46,719
plant and sticking it into like some

1060
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,838
sort of dirt

1061
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:51,519
i've done that too um

1062
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:53,039
i've done that when i'm like if you make

1063
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:55,838
it you make it

1064
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,320
bye you know that's that's kind of how

1065
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,559
i've

1066
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,599
how i've done that form of cloning

1067
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:01,679
personally

1068
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,519
um but i know a lot of gardeners who

1069
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:07,039
that's just how they do it

1070
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:09,119
um again a plant is so resilient it

1071
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,119
you know you can have success with it in

1072
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,920
any of those forms of that i've talked

1073
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,280
about or

1074
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,119
you know drop in the comments maybe

1075
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,440
other ways that you've cloned i know

1076
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,240
customers who clone on the plant you

1077
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,838
know um

1078
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,078
so it's there's a lot of different forms

1079
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:24,159
but

1080
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,680
you know going back to just sticking it

1081
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,960
in the in the

1082
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:30,799
dirt just like cutting it when you're

1083
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,639
making that cut up the plant it's a lot

1084
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,960
for your plant to overcome so

1085
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:36,159
your your root time your root

1086
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,480
development time

1087
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:40,000
i just have found personally to be so

1088
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,000
far extrapolated from

1089
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,199
kind of the more primitive way of going

1090
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,280
about it

1091
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:49,039
that that's not how i practice

1092
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,800
my gardening because it would just be so

1093
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:52,800
stunning and and not

1094
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,839
consistent and not perpetual and that's

1095
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,839
the whole reason that i

1096
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,759
got into cloning is so that i could keep

1097
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:58,559
certain cultivars or phenotypes around

1098
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,720
that i could

1099
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,960
keep the garden perpetual and keep

1100
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:06,319
growing and keep hunting and

1101
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,358
and flowering so um

1102
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,838
i think aeroponics are have been the

1103
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:14,719
best in that sense the most streamlined

1104
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:16,639
um i have had certain phenotypes that

1105
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:21,118
just do not take to that well

1106
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:23,759
so you have to venture into other areas

1107
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,240
whether it be sticking it straight in or

1108
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,800
or

1109
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:32,159
using uh soilless cubes

1110
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,440
so it's situational

1111
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,559
can we get like five cents every time

1112
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,440
you say that um but

1113
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:41,440
yeah so i i think you know when you're

1114
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,240
talking about preference aeroponics for

1115
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,480
me

1116
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:45,439
and right next to that you know tried

1117
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,559
and true for me is

1118
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,519
is gonna be the soilless peak cube um

1119
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:53,440
i've had people see or seen people have

1120
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:54,719
really great success in the grow dance i

1121
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,159
just always used to call those things

1122
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:57,199
black magic because it didn't make any

1123
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:58,719
sense to me

1124
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,559
because they were not always as popular

1125
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:01,199
as they are now with instagram and

1126
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,320
everything

1127
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:06,078
but um i think what's nice with those is

1128
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,519
it allows you the ability to go into any

1129
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,039
kind of medium

1130
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:10,719
so that's the other thing is like when

1131
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:13,599
you start a

1132
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:14,000
clone in a peak cube you can go in the

1133
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,000
soil

1134
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:21,199
fairly well going into hydro okay

1135
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,039
with grow it and i've seen them

1136
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,519
that that transfer shock be a little

1137
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:26,880
less and even with aeroponics if i wait

1138
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:30,159
too long and i

1139
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,358
mess around and i have hydro plants

1140
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,000
that transition into my cocoa blend with

1141
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:35,759
pete

1142
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,440
is a little bit of you know they get a

1143
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,280
little wonky on me you know they might

1144
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,240
shoot a yellow leaf or two they might

1145
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,359
get a little

1146
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:46,639
upset with me um versus

1147
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:49,119
having that transition be more mild so

1148
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:50,358
again it's it's genetic plant dependent

1149
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,358
but

1150
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:54,559
gardener-dependent but yeah

1151
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:57,440
all right so digging a little bit deep

1152
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:59,519
into aeroponics what should the ph of

1153
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,320
the water be and do you actually use a

1154
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:02,800
solution

1155
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,640
like you mentioned clonex earlier i'd

1156
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,240
use anything in the aeroponic machine as

1157
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:10,719
far as solution

1158
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:14,479
solution uh for me it's just

1159
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:17,519
a little a little bit of orca

1160
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,400
and not really not when i when i when i

1161
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:21,358
initially set up my my cloner as time

1162
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,200
goes on

1163
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:28,318
i'll add um clear as i'll add

1164
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:28,639
a little bit of clonex solution um i

1165
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:31,599
just

1166
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:33,199
i had some i had some issues with my

1167
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,599
with my 32 site and

1168
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:36,639
and i never used to you have to use

1169
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,800
clonex

1170
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:43,358
but my plants or my clones have

1171
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,720
just seemed to again maybe because it's

1172
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,480
having that little bit of food in there

1173
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:49,439
giving them a little bit of energy

1174
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,119
to use for what they're doing but that

1175
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,960
has seemed to help me if i add that a

1176
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,880
little bit later on along with

1177
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,318
some sort of beneficial microbial in

1178
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,358
there usually

1179
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:00,800
some liquid form again i i used to do

1180
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:01,838
great white in there i used to have a

1181
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,240
whole

1182
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:05,279
not concoction but i i felt the need to

1183
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:07,358
dial it back

1184
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,519
you know simplify it because i wasn't

1185
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:09,920
seeing the same success results that i

1186
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:12,880
was

1187
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,720
from you know blending i had like kalen

1188
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,880
and great white and

1189
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:18,559
this and that in there and like while

1190
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,200
all those things do help your root

1191
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,279
process

1192
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,480
like they have a time and a place so

1193
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,160
i've just found

1194
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,000
that that has helped me like to

1195
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:27,440
gradually add it not make a big old

1196
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,559
solution that i'm running

1197
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,519
from jump so is it a specific ph that

1198
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:34,960
you do or

1199
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:37,599
no um yes sorry uh

1200
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,000
i i try to stay around six i used to

1201
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,359
have this like

1202
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,559
battle where i wanted to be at 5.8 but

1203
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,440
six is good got it and then i know for

1204
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:49,279
aeroponics

1205
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,119
some people just have the sprayers on 24

1206
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,960
7. some people put it on a timer so it

1207
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,960
comes on every so often

1208
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,000
what do you do for that personally i've

1209
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,358
never put my

1210
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,719
my aeroponic cloner on a timer i do know

1211
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:06,159
a couple of grower buddies who

1212
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:06,959
uh one of them he has it on a timer he

1213
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:09,679
sees

1214
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,519
he doesn't see good results if he

1215
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:14,078
doesn't have it on a timer so he stays

1216
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,960
with that method pretty consistently

1217
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,680
another buddy uh put his on a timer

1218
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,358
thinking

1219
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:21,118
okay i'm gonna this is the cheat code

1220
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:23,679
right and he just

1221
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,640
it wasn't really successful for him uh

1222
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:28,559
so he ended up

1223
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:31,358
kind of taking that element out um

1224
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:31,759
yeah i i just keep them running i i just

1225
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:34,480
those

1226
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,079
those pumps in there don't like i

1227
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,000
personally i don't i haven't seen them

1228
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,400
like to go on and off and off and on i

1229
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,358
even when i'm not using my clone or have

1230
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,559
it running

1231
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:45,679
uh it's got just a solution of um highly

1232
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:48,159
concentrated

1233
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:49,919
hydrogen peroxide in water but so it's

1234
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:50,799
just cleaning itself constantly but i

1235
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,280
don't let those

1236
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,720
pumps dry up or dry out because and

1237
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,160
obviously if the pump's coming on it's

1238
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:59,039
not going to dry out but

1239
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:59,838
those things are just so so finicky so

1240
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:02,000
okay now

1241
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:03,039
typically what light cycle do you place

1242
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,400
to clones under

1243
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:12,559
18 6 24 24 0

1244
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:14,000
12 12. um

1245
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:15,759
i think people do that right are there

1246
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,960
people out there that put it on 12 12

1247
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,960
i think they do it for a short period of

1248
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,358
time and then they they switch to 18 six

1249
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,480
i believe or veterans oh okay okay i

1250
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:24,078
think yeah

1251
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,079
let us know in the comments if you do it

1252
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,039
right right no i i'm 18

1253
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,480
and six the only kind of like light

1254
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,440
schedule they're on is when

1255
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,800
they i'm that first week i kind of tuck

1256
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,440
them away from the light

1257
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,560
because i just don't feel that they need

1258
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,240
direct light

1259
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:45,119
you know um i have a small

1260
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:45,519
uh chiltek led mini so like it's perfect

1261
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,000
for

1262
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:48,800
cloning and i turn it down but i even

1263
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,039
like [ __ ] the

1264
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,318
cloner away from it just so that it's

1265
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:54,559
not

1266
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:56,239
directly in that light you know

1267
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,000
obviously season's depending because

1268
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:58,639
like temperature and things play a role

1269
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,480
but

1270
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:04,000
um i've just found that they

1271
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,760
it's almost like you know you take that

1272
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,159
first week to sleep from recovery or

1273
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,079
whatever

1274
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:09,679
you know like they don't need it right

1275
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,599
up under there and then once they

1276
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:12,719
you can see that they're you know i

1277
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,480
throw them under there and give them a

1278
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:15,279
decent amount of light on that 18 and

1279
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,519
six so

1280
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,000
yeah i usually do 18 6 too and that was

1281
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,440
my next question is how much light

1282
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,519
do you typically give the clones and

1283
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,200
then you know talking about spectrum is

1284
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,440
there a certain spectrum that you like

1285
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:30,159
to give your clones in particular

1286
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,880
yeah i i i was running under their mini

1287
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:34,000
red

1288
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:37,599
and i mean i had results i there wasn't

1289
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:41,119
a single problem but just the

1290
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:44,960
the the you know whatever we

1291
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:47,599
excuse me uh plant guru in me

1292
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,199
was like there's a reason why you have

1293
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,359
veg and bloom spectrums

1294
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:52,318
you know as a guy who runs a hydrostar

1295
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:54,000
i'm just like okay

1296
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:55,679
you know so what's up with your guys's

1297
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,039
blue speck so

1298
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:00,799
because i just i feel like if you're

1299
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:02,800
if they're more established plants you

1300
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,079
can play around with different spectrums

1301
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,160
and even like

1302
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,200
uh infiltrating some more red spectrums

1303
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:09,598
right because

1304
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,318
as spring like the almost time that

1305
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,200
we're in now

1306
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:15,039
comes around you get a bit more of those

1307
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:16,318
coming in than you do from winter you

1308
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:19,119
know even or

1309
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:20,559
for instance right um so i don't think

1310
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,760
it's the worst thing in like

1311
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:24,639
uh mid to late veg but early veg i like

1312
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,839
to have that

1313
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:29,759
that blue green springy spectrum

1314
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:31,358
so got it yeah when it talks about how

1315
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,240
much light typically

1316
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:35,920
you know if we're talking par in ppfd in

1317
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:36,799
particular i usually aim for like 200 to

1318
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,480
400

1319
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,880
ppfd for my clones a little bit less

1320
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,240
than that

1321
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,318
actually get away with with the rooting

1322
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,279
process as well now as far as the actual

1323
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:47,279
spectrum

1324
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,359
i do like to give it a blue i mean we

1325
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,640
know that blue inhibits cell division

1326
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:51,920
that's going to lead to tighter node

1327
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:54,159
spacing

1328
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,960
that is something where you generally

1329
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:56,639
hear that

1330
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,000
for the veg stage you want more blue in

1331
00:45:56,639 --> 00:45:59,358
the spectrum for

1332
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,440
the flowering stage more red in the

1333
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:03,119
spectrum i typically do go up more on

1334
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,760
the blue side of things when i'm

1335
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,440
when i have clones underneath it now as

1336
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,800
far as the environment let's get into

1337
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,800
that a little bit

1338
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,800
um in your environment what do you

1339
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,800
typically aim for the temperature

1340
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,000
and the humidity to be when rooting

1341
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,280
clones

1342
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,079
so for like when i'm rooting my soil

1343
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,760
cubes

1344
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,680
it's a little bit different for me than

1345
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,839
when you're when when i'm running my

1346
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:26,879
rooting in my aeroponic corner just

1347
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:28,799
because when i'm

1348
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,640
rooting with the soil cubes i keep them

1349
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,519
underneath the humidity dome

1350
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:34,480
almost the entirety that they're rooting

1351
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:36,639
so that

1352
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,719
environment that they're directly in is

1353
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:39,358
probably closer to you know the tropical

1354
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:43,039
environment

1355
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:44,159
80 degrees and you know 70 degrees or 60

1356
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:46,079
degrees humidity

1357
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:47,759
so because i'm spraying it every day i'm

1358
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,960
i'm keeping it very moist in there so

1359
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,400
they don't have to search

1360
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:55,519
for uh water of any sort

1361
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:59,519
uh and then with my aeroponic

1362
00:46:55,519 --> 00:47:02,719
and with any clone i should say like

1363
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:04,400
the the environment should should should

1364
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:06,399
match that to a degree

1365
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,000
dialed down you don't necessarily have

1366
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,800
to keep i don't keep a dome

1367
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,239
over my aeroponic loner i i do know

1368
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,440
gardeners who do

1369
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:16,879
um i don't personally but i then want to

1370
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,358
keep that area very

1371
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,119
inoculated to that germination like

1372
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:24,239
environment where it's

1373
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:27,280
you know 70 78 degrees

1374
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:28,318
and pretty humid because those little

1375
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,559
ones love

1376
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:32,159
that type of like just you know

1377
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,480
encapsulated environment

1378
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:36,318
you know to do what they need to do so

1379
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,119
temperature i usually aim for is between

1380
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:40,480
like 75 and 82 degrees fahrenheit is

1381
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,760
what i usually aim for when i'm when i'm

1382
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,119
rooting clones

1383
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,280
uh humidity you know above 65 percent um

1384
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,760
you know up to up to 90 for the like the

1385
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,000
first day or so for the first 24 hours i

1386
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,200
mean if it's 90 95 percent

1387
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,480
for the first 24 48 hours um i've

1388
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:56,960
actually had pretty good luck doing that

1389
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,880
as well

1390
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,358
and as i read in books as well as a

1391
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,720
technique uh but yeah kind of above the

1392
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:05,920
65

1393
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:07,838
is kind of what i've had best luck on

1394
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,920
now some people i know they monitor also

1395
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:13,358
the the temperature of the medium

1396
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,039
i like i mentioned briefly earlier is

1397
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:16,558
cutting a clone stick it directly into

1398
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:18,079
the medium that's kind of my primary way

1399
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,680
of doing things it's just

1400
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,359
easy for me i don't have an aeroponic

1401
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:23,838
clone or anything um

1402
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:25,519
what i usually aim for for a soil level

1403
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:29,119
temperature or soil temperature

1404
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:31,199
is between 72 and 82 degrees fahrenheit

1405
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,160
i have tried to probably the biggest

1406
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,639
fail

1407
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:35,598
um is whenever i try to clone and all of

1408
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:38,000
a sudden the temperature is

1409
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:40,559
too low when it's in like the soil the

1410
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,599
medium temperature is like in the 60s

1411
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,160
it just it doesn't root anywhere near as

1412
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,160
fast

1413
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:47,598
like you'll keep the plant somewhat

1414
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:49,118
alive but

1415
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,720
it's just not going to ruin and you'll

1416
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,760
see deficiencies at least that's been my

1417
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:54,399
experience

1418
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,480
doing that so i know you said you mostly

1419
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,800
do the aeroponic side of things

1420
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:03,838
is there a specific water temperature

1421
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,200
that you go by well i was gonna say it

1422
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:08,078
but i didn't want to

1423
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:10,000
jump into your question too far but um

1424
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,720
the temperature above

1425
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,880
shouldn't drastically be different from

1426
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:17,838
below

1427
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,480
if your below temperature is drastically

1428
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:20,558
below

1429
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,760
above then you know you have these weird

1430
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,599
plants that try to

1431
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,280
you know shoot their roots upward

1432
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,519
because the roots want

1433
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,160
you know again that inoculated warm

1434
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:33,039
environment so for my aeroponic cloner

1435
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:34,318
i try to stay in that like 70 to 72

1436
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:37,039
degree

1437
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:37,440
water temperature anything lower than

1438
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:40,800
that

1439
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,400
i have slowed root growth i i have no

1440
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,079
root growth dependent and that's why

1441
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,639
it's hard like to use the aeroponic

1442
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,720
cloner

1443
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:47,679
successfully in a hundred percent

1444
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:51,519
capacity

1445
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:54,239
and like the dry uh hot

1446
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:55,280
because you have the heat on winter you

1447
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:58,479
know or cold

1448
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,319
dry winter and then you know in summer

1449
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,400
i usually have great success clothing

1450
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:04,079
but you don't necessarily need

1451
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,440
to to be doing that much in the

1452
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,079
summertime so

1453
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,440
um it's kind of a give or take but i

1454
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,680
would say

1455
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,720
you know i use you know water bottles to

1456
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:14,719
regulate in the

1457
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:16,399
in the summertime when that pump creates

1458
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:18,399
too much uh

1459
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,160
warmth in the same sense you have to

1460
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,200
stay kind of regulated to get

1461
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:24,000
those roots exactly how you want them to

1462
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:25,679
be in the time

1463
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,679
that you want to be when you're talking

1464
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:29,199
aeroponics and

1465
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:31,279
you know sounds like you're having the

1466
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:34,000
same um

1467
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,559
you know having to regulate with soil

1468
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,599
and with

1469
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:40,319
the root cubes

1470
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,680
for i don't pay attention to temperature

1471
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:43,759
too much but i just

1472
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:45,199
stress to myself and my customers that

1473
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,839
you keep them moist because once they

1474
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:48,558
dry out

1475
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:50,159
it's just so hard to recover from that

1476
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,720
yeah this then that's what the seedling

1477
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:53,838
mats

1478
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:54,879
are very helpful um you gotta be be

1479
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:57,358
careful because i've

1480
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,400
placed my uh cups directly onto the

1481
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:01,039
seedling

1482
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,639
mats and just fried my roots right it's

1483
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:04,800
just it becomes too hot

1484
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,960
there is a temperature monitor on some

1485
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,119
of these seedling mats

1486
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,960
so you can get more accurate as far as

1487
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,240
what it is but

1488
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,400
your seedling mat if you have one

1489
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:15,118
without the the temperature monitor on

1490
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,000
it

1491
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,800
you know placing towels in between that

1492
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,199
can help

1493
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,880
so you don't fry your roots because it

1494
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:23,519
won't root if the temperature is too hot

1495
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,880
right

1496
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:28,559
i put a i screwed myself in an aeroponic

1497
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,318
because it was cold and it was on a

1498
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:33,359
metal surface

1499
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:33,920
and we insulated but it was still too

1500
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:36,960
warm

1501
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,720
so um while

1502
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,199
it would have been too cold without it

1503
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:44,159
it was too warm with it and we got

1504
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:45,838
root sludge and it was not good so makes

1505
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:46,399
sense so it is definitely important for

1506
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:48,000
sure

1507
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,800
so generally speaking how long does it

1508
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,119
take for a clone to root situational no

1509
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,000
no

1510
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,000
no no um

1511
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,679
depending on cultivar the only that's

1512
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,719
the only reason why i say that that was

1513
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:01,039
my only

1514
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:03,039
i don't know it depends uh when i seen

1515
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:04,880
that question

1516
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:07,519
just probably personally because right

1517
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:11,358
now i'm having an issue with my wi-fi

1518
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:13,119
um she just

1519
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:14,960
does taking her sweet time i tell you

1520
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:18,640
what whereas i have

1521
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,838
other uh cultivars genetics that just

1522
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:21,440
you know they're almost like too quick

1523
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:22,000
you're like well dang i needed like two

1524
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,800
weeks

1525
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,480
before you were ready you know so it's

1526
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,280
seven days like i'm not ready you know

1527
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,920
so um i think that's pretty typical

1528
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,760
seven to

1529
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,039
seven to 14 days some people like to say

1530
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,040
seven to ten

1531
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:36,159
and it really depends on what a root is

1532
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:38,079
to you because like

1533
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:40,078
certain people will think that what i

1534
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,640
call like the color flowering

1535
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,680
of the root or the stem uh where it's

1536
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:45,920
just about

1537
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:47,118
just about to shoot out those roots

1538
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,680
they'll call those roots

1539
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:52,240
i call roots roots so i mean that just

1540
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:54,078
depends on who you are

1541
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:56,318
because even once i see roots come out i

1542
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:59,200
wanted to be well developed

1543
00:52:56,318 --> 00:53:00,880
before i transplant them so that makes

1544
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:02,399
sense i think the method also will will

1545
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,119
determine how long it takes to root

1546
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,720
right if you're

1547
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,240
sticking it directly in the medium i

1548
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:08,799
don't think i've had roots

1549
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:09,759
any sooner than 10 days i mean 14 days

1550
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,280
is typical

1551
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:14,240
for when you can tell the plant has

1552
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,359
rooted and now new growth is starting um

1553
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:17,199
you know sticking it directly into the

1554
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,519
medium now with an aeroponic loaner i

1555
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:19,279
mean

1556
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:20,719
can't you get something some people get

1557
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,680
roots in like six days or something like

1558
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:24,719
that six

1559
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:26,480
yeah i've heard four days

1560
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:28,159
so it's like i don't know i'm like i

1561
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,869
don't know what kind again black magic

1562
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:31,838
you're using

1563
00:53:28,869 --> 00:53:33,440
[Laughter]

1564
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:34,960
but i mean they could just have a really

1565
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,519
good environment

1566
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,199
i mean it just can can come down to that

1567
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:40,079
it's not nothing they're doing it's just

1568
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,719
you know

1569
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,839
the the the genetic or phenotype they

1570
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:46,558
have is just a

1571
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:48,639
quick rooter and a quick cloner and they

1572
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,160
have the perfect environment or

1573
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:52,480
you know maybe they just are really that

1574
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:54,399
good but yeah aeroponics

1575
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,079
that's why i say it's the quickest way

1576
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,760
if you can get it dialed in

1577
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:59,680
if you if it's not dialed in and you're

1578
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,440
having fluctuation

1579
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:02,639
and everything it can be a headache and

1580
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,519
make you feel like you don't know what

1581
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,078
you're doing

1582
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:07,280
so for sure well i think we covered a

1583
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:09,039
