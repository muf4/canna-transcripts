1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,560
coming up on Garden talk once you end up

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,160
with branches that are too skinny that

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,279
are in the middle still cuz some

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,759
genetics like to do that you want to

5
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:12,039
lollipop those as much as possible

6
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:13,759
you're going to get more production

7
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:15,558
vertically some people don't find it to

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,359
be a pretty looking sight but if you do

9
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:18,960
it just right lollipop and maintenance

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,720
your plants you'll get more production

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,039
that way vertical and it's all about a

12
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,559
leveled canopy and that's where topping

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,000
will help you out you just making sure

14
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,038
you're nothing you're not letting

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
anything

16
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,880
get like this you don't you don't want

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,519
something low and something High my

18
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:36,920
first trellis is simply to train the

19
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,320
plant the second trellis is to support

20
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,840
the middle branches and the third trus

21
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,399
is to uh support the upper part of the

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,199
branches it's nice to be able to create

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,079
that beautiful art and train a plant the

24
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:51,679
way you see them being trained but not

25
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,679
put that much physical labor into

26
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,599
it what's up everybody if you that don't

coming on appreciate it today we're

92
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,000
going to talk about maximizing yield

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,959
with plant training so there are so many

94
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,158
different ways to train plants and if

95
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,719
you do things right you can absolutely

96
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,519
increase the overall yield but before we

97
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,000
get deep into that let's do an

98
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:40,000
introduction can you tell us a little

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,639
bit about yourself and how you got into

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,158
gardening yeah so um I I was really

101
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,559
active as a kid and I used to like

102
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,199
really be into sports and uh the one

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,199
that took its toll on me the most was

104
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:53,839
basketball after a few like wear and

105
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:55,318
tear on my ankles I um I said I found

106
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,719
that this medicine helped me deal with

107
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:01,560
the pain a lot better than um you know

108
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:03,560
other things so after while I um you

109
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,519
know I started to take advantage of the

110
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,479
the

111
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:10,039
opportunity uh in 2010 they started uh

112
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,639
um well they didn't start that's when I

113
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:16,560
heard about it the

114
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:18,680
program um the medical plant program LIC

115
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,680
so that's when I got my started getting

116
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,199
my hands dirty that's awesome so before

117
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,639
we get deep into training plants one of

118
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,600
the things you had mention when I sent

119
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,160
you over the initial list of questions

120
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,479
is you had mentioned that the plant

121
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,240
needs to be healthy and you wanted to

122
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:34,079
talk about plant Health First talk to us

123
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,079
about plant Health why is that so

124
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:40,719
important before you start training

125
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:43,038
plants so um you know before before we

126
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,520
talk about uh plant training I'd like to

127
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:47,000
obviously talk about um plant health

128
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,198
because without a healthy plant you

129
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,560
really can't do anything um although

130
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,720
like a lot of people that are starting

131
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,038
off I realize people pop seeds and they

132
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,919
have really healthy plants cuz they

133
00:04:55,038 --> 00:05:00,439
haven't gotten any viruses or any kind

134
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:02,560
of um bugs yet but so people that

135
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:05,079
probably for the most part have a clone

136
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,639
where maybe there's a virus in there or

137
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:10,240
some kind of uh pathogens or or even

138
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,000
even like it's good to start off with

139
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,038
bugs and make sure you don't have bugs

140
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and why your plant sick and most

141
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:20,478
importantly the worst one is when you're

142
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,079
uh when your when your stems get purple

143
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,839
it's really hard to train your plants so

144
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:26,599
like if you have purple stems in

145
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:28,799
vegetation not in flower because those

146
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,439
are two different things usually if you

147
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,079
put the light Too Close flower you'll

148
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:35,800
get like uh the the the the plant itself

149
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:37,719
will try to what they call uh like shade

150
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,439
itself so it turns purple and that's

151
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,639
fine in flower but in vegetation if that

152
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:45,519
happens and it's coming from a

153
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,160
deficiency then you have to try to

154
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,959
correct it and that's where you start

155
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,000
digging I I like to start off making

156
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,879
sure I don't have bugs that I can't see

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,639
but usually I'm really dig you know like

158
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:59,800
very Vigilant on um in my garden making

159
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,038
sure I don't have that and once I find

160
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,240
out if I find out I have like something

161
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:06,918
in my root roots or anything like that I

162
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:13,079
usually start off with like

163
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:16,839
um I'll start off with 3 G per gallon of

164
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:18,399
uh peroxide I use um sanidate which is

165
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:20,679
more concentrated so it's probably a

166
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,560
more concentrated dosage than you would

167
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,319
get out of

168
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,038
peroxide with that said though uh I'll

169
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,639
I'll also use um a little bit of dish

170
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:33,360
soap and um that seems to like really

171
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,960
help me out like in the root system but

172
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,479
what happens is I wipe out a lot of my

173
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:41,598
um my built up colonies of like microbes

174
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:43,359
microfungi whatever is in there that I

175
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:45,560
took me so long to build up then I have

176
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,479
to kind of like reinoculate and get

177
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,639
everything back in the output like

178
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:54,199
usually I like to use uh amino acids

179
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,918
fobic acid and uh humic acid all at the

180
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,439
same time which is you know it's in the

181
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:00,000
recharge so that's kind of like a little

182
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,439
bit of a cheat code but if I want to get

183
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,160
more of it I'll just get it separately

184
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:05,680
and I'll add it in there all in the same

185
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,759
day I'll put microbes everything right

186
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,840
back

187
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:12,000
in and um after I see that I don't have

188
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:16,159
any bugs or anything what I'll do is the

189
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,240
next step I'll take is I'll actually add

190
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,080
magnesium and if you're if you're

191
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,199
already using Epsom salt and you're

192
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,800
already using a magnesium I I recommend

193
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,400
to use a little more

194
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:31,240
magnesium and I also recommend to use uh

195
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:33,839
phosphorus sep SE in raw form usually

196
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,478
like if you if you buy like a product

197
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,638
like raw for example uh raw mpk they'll

198
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:41,199
already have it in the uh you know they

199
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,360
have it in raw form so you could just go

200
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,759
buy it it's just real easy to have it in

201
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,680
raw form add a little more of those two

202
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,919
things which is uh the Magnesium I

203
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,759
mentioned and the phosphorus and that

204
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:56,680
kind of covers you um and you know for

205
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,560
the sake of having purple stems along

206
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,199
with the fact that you do have to make

207
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,680
sure that your environment is correct

208
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,120
once you get your environment correct

209
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,840
and go over those two three things that

210
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,918
I just mentioned that's like my process

211
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,638
of elimination when it comes to purple

212
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:13,318
stems what exactly is the issue with

213
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,680
purple stems though you hear people say

214
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,120
it's zinc you hear some people say it's

215
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,879
phosphorus you hear some people say it's

216
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,158
magnesium you hear people say that it's

217
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,720
for cold

218
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:23,719
temperatures is it one of the things and

219
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,720
not the other or is it a combination of

220
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,919
things or what my answer to that is

221
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,120
usually when I start to spot purple

222
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:36,158
stems it'll be like after I transplant

223
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:39,719
it and um maybe like left the lights at

224
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:42,918
and all the way 100%

225
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,760
intensity um I'll notice the purple St

226
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:46,199
that's almost me creating it but if I

227
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,679
could be on top of it and I could like

228
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,640
lower my my percentage to around 30 40%

229
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:54,278
for the first 5 days uh it kind of helps

230
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:57,039
me ease my way into the the process cuz

231
00:08:54,278 --> 00:09:00,078
I notice more purple stems with

232
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,078
LEDs and um I think it has a lot to do

233
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:02,879
with the fact that the lights are

234
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:04,719
flickering at a faster rate than your

235
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,399
traditional

236
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,000
HPS now with all that said there's other

237
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:11,679
ways to create purple stems um like if

238
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,720
it gets too cold obviously you're going

239
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:17,239
to get purple stems and you know I I

240
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,120
really talk about it a lot when I'm

241
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,879
around other Growers and and they they

242
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,600
they like they like man what's your your

243
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,159
problem with purple stems but if you

244
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,959
have purple stems you just can't train

245
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:28,600
your plants if you're if that's what

246
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,239
you're trying to do is train your plants

247
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,399
yeah the stems become more harder and

248
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,000
less like malleable and you can't really

249
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:38,000
bend them as well I mean I totally agree

250
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,078
with you on that one and it seems like

251
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
it doesn't girth up like your branches

252
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:44,439
don't thicken up after they they if you

253
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,519
can correct the problem you'll start to

254
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,519
see these green lines coming through and

255
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,159
then the green lines almost like uh come

256
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,759
out and then push out the

257
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:56,199
purple and eventually you'll see purple

258
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,559
lines if you corrected the problem you

259
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,640
know like if you did a good job at

260
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:01,000
correcting it and you got it on time but

261
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:02,799
there's been times where I've where I've

262
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,240
gotten purple stems and like the plants

263
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,479
almost never recovered from it and

264
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,278
there's been times where you just go

265
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,120
into flower and they almost like fix

266
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:13,519
themselves right away because sometimes

267
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,159
they say don't put a you know like a a

268
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,360
sick plant in the

269
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:18,879
flower and which I don't I don't

270
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,320
recommend to do it but there's been

271
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,120
times where my plant's been sick and

272
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,560
just the 12 hours of resting and maybe

273
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,159
something in the formula because they're

274
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,319
get more phosphorus right away it just

275
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:32,439
corrects

276
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,600
it you know I don't recommend it but I I

277
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,519
actually recommend to get your

278
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,040
environment under

279
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,839
control you get you go through them

280
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,120
three things that I brought up and and

281
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,639
and that's a good way to kind of go

282
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,480
about correcting the the purple stems

283
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,600
okay so say the plant is healthy someone

284
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,720
is ready for training let's start with

285
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,040
one of the most common methods of

286
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,759
training which is low stress training

287
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:56,958
talk to us what is low stress training

288
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:59,319
when do you do low low stress training

289
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:01,879
and how do you do low stress training

290
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:05,399
order to maximize yield so one thing I

291
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:08,679
do want to be clear on is that um you

292
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,639
don't need to necessarily do these these

293
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:13,638
these uh practices that we're talking

294
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,360
about and like to it's not the only way

295
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,320
to get maximum production if you have

296
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,440
like a tent and the law says you can

297
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,720
grow 12 plants then you could

298
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:27,560
just basically what we're trying to do

299
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:29,560
is create what a a a sea of green and it

300
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:31,078
doesn't matter how you do it or how I do

301
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:33,599
it it just matters that I fill it and I

302
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:36,519
make it look the same

303
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,519
so basically this this strategy that

304
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:40,159
we're

305
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,320
um that that I'm practicing is for like

306
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:47,319
micro Growers where they've they've kind

307
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:49,040
of set certain laws and in that they

308
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,519
kind of uh they made it to where you

309
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:54,679
can't really mass-produce it you so so

310
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:57,000
like some people micro grows will make

311
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:59,278
the best out of the 24 some people even

312
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,679
the 12 plants they have so that's why

313
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:06,559
people do this and and with that said

314
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:07,958
um so what happens is when you when you

315
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,359
when you only have so many plants to

316
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:12,159
work with you got a 4x4 you got a you

317
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,839
know 6x6 and you're trying to train

318
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,439
plants and you only have four because

319
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:20,279
that's what you want to

320
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,760
do what happens is when you all the oxin

321
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:23,559
which are the hormones of that plant are

322
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,639
at the top of the plant and when you

323
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:28,039
pull these plants out and if you do it

324
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:31,560
properly with the right pruning the

325
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:33,519
middle branches are going to grow up and

326
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:35,000
when people are scrogging which is the

327
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,320
difference is that that's not what

328
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,320
they're looking to do they're looking to

329
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,639
kind of do more branches to where um

330
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,519
you're kind of focusing a little

331
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,560
different when you're when you're doing

332
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:48,639
the LST grow and you're trying to grow a

333
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:52,518
perfect Bush of a

334
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:55,480
plant so um to uh to to kind of shed a

335
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,799
little more light on that LST is when

336
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,399
you um when you pull the main branch

337
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:02,679
down or a couple main branch anes you

338
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,559
distribute the the plant energy towards

339
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:08,879
the middle of the plant and it um like I

340
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,559
said with the rate lollipopping and and

341
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,958
defoliation you can get colas in the

342
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,559
middle cuz that's basically what a lot

343
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,958
of people want to do they don't want to

344
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:19,319
end up with the smaller buds but um very

345
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:22,679
important another thing I like to

346
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:27,000
mention is it's important

347
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:29,239
to not train the skinnier not so thick

348
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,799
branches that are in the middle but but

349
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,399
to train only the big thick branches

350
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:37,399
that were kind of like the ones that

351
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:38,879
were too tall you move those out and um

352
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,360
once you end up with branches that are

353
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,879
too skinny that are in the middle still

354
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,320
cuz some genetics like to do that you

355
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:51,360
want to lollipop those as much as

356
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,800
possible and leave it alone and if not

357
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,600
if if it shows you it has enough

358
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,399
potential to do something that maybe top

359
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,320
it but really lollipopping is like one

360
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,399
of the things that's more important than

361
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,560
anything when it comes to Growing

362
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,360
because um if I if you gave me one style

363
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:07,359
to grow right now and I only had one way

364
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,278
to do it it' just be a bunch of plants

365
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,839
and I lollipop them it's so it really

366
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:13,919
comes down to plant maintenance and uh

367
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,759
plant Health we'll get into lollipopping

368
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,838
in a little bit here that is uh one of

369
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,839
the questions on the list here a little

370
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,160
bit later I think one of the biggest

371
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,440
mistakes that new Growers make that are

372
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,879
just starting to train is pulling that

373
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,759
initial Branch down and you mentioned

374
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,120
you talked about like the hormones and

375
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:33,800
if you don't actually pull that Branch

376
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,600
down so it's lower than the other

377
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:37,198
branches then that main branch that you

378
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,800
just pulled down is going to still

379
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,439
continue to dominate and uh you know

380
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:43,519
sometimes when the plant is Young you

381
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,440
can't actually pull that Branch all the

382
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,480
way down to be lower sometimes you just

383
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,279
need to do a slight Bend to begin but

384
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,920
eventually you want to get that main top

385
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:52,679
down lower than some of the other

386
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:55,399
branches so the plant will then Focus

387
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:57,838
its growth on those other branches it

388
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:00,879
happens time and time again with with me

389
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,560
it can be tricky it's not always easy to

390
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:06,519
do but I fig I'd mention that one yeah

391
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:09,319
I'd like to also add to that and uh

392
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:12,078
where I would want to add is on top of

393
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,278
what you said um sometimes you tie a

394
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:17,599
branch down and it's not tied um you

395
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,759
know good enough and now this branch is

396
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,639
is like coming up and now it's just it

397
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,079
almost like it just doesn't look right

398
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:24,959
if you could really hold that Branch

399
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:28,318
there that's that's very important to be

400
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:30,359
able to really firmly whatever trellis

401
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:31,958
unit you have if you could just firmly

402
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,318
hold it there and not allow it to come

403
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:36,239
back up cuz it's just it's not what you

404
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:39,599
were what you were aiming for when you

405
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,839
started everything so speaking of I

406
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,759
started using the training Clips in

407
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,160
order to then train them on train them

408
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,318
later and I noticed that uh a good

409
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:50,759
friend of mine you know he he he

410
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:52,159
basically told me this would happen

411
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:54,159
years ago and I never tried it but I

412
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:57,759
wanted to do it for for

413
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:59,600
R&amp;D and uh when I put the clips on it

414
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,600
took them off did everything

415
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,920
right I went to open them up again I

416
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,920
went to basically train the the plant

417
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:10,719
again and it snapped so I noticed that

418
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:12,879
um you know when you do that you're

419
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,680
creating that that Barky area where it

420
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:18,318
gets like a knuckle sometimes and even

421
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:20,239
almost like a super crop style and when

422
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:23,078
you go to train it again it's impossible

423
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,240
so just kind of talking from like my

424
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:28,318
experience and and and basically how far

425
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,839
I've gotten so far I realized that uh

426
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:33,799
it's not a good idea to to get that that

427
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,279
bark on there at that shorter area if

428
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:38,240
you're not aiming for a small little

429
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:39,679
plant if you're aiming to get like a

430
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,959
bigger plant and you want to be able to

431
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,278
train it or manipulate it um you can

432
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:48,399
never retrain it after you already got

433
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:50,720
that knuckle on it so it just makes it

434
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,480
that much harder so going back to the

435
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,839
LST it's it's all right to low stress

436
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,319
train and kind of pull the plant around

437
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:00,160
and do what you want to do with it but

438
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:01,838
um your once you once you put the

439
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,240
training clip or you do any kind of

440
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,279
tying down and creating that little

441
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,798
knuckle at the bottom training Clips

442
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:11,160
there's some people who probably don't

443
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:12,519
know what that is can you just clarify

444
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,400
what exactly you mean by the training

445
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:15,720
Clips are they just the standard garden

446
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,240
clips so you talking about the ones that

447
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,000
actually attach to the actual stem yeah

448
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,038
I just started like kind of like doing

449
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,919
research with them cuz I wanted to

450
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:27,240
implement it in my garden um and I don't

451
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,600
know the exact name of them but they're

452
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,359
the ones that everybody's 3D printing

453
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:32,079
now you you put it in there and it just

454
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:33,399
kind of is in there you know there's

455
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,639
Different Strokes with different folks

456
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,320
it depends who you are and what you're

457
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,880
trying to do that's a perfect um

458
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:40,639
strategy for somebody that's not going

459
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,640
to train the plant

460
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,240
again cuz like you know I as far as my

461
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,600
my uh product testing went that's that's

462
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,319
what I tried to do and um it just it

463
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:54,480
didn't didn't work the way I wanted it

464
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:56,200
to I've never used those trading clips

465
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,319
that you mentioned whether it goes

466
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,038
directly on the branches usually I'm

467
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:03,000
actually clipping it onto the side of

468
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:05,839
the grow pot just a regular Garden clip

469
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,480
and then using uh just regular Garden

470
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:11,439
ties like two bucks at your local

471
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,880
gardening store and using those to tie

472
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,798
down the branches to the side of the

473
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,960
growt definitely a different technique

474
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:17,918
there there's so many different ways to

475
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,279
go about it are you tying the branches

476
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,320
down to the side of the grow POD at all

477
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,359
or you just using the training Clips so

478
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,639
that wasn't that like I said that was um

479
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,279
just kind of like a a trial that I did

480
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,000
just to see how everything would work

481
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:34,359
out um obviously you know I use the

482
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,839
umbrellas and uh what I do it's a custom

483
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:39,879
trellis that I design that um it's not

484
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,480
it's not very given it doesn't give it

485
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,080
doesn't give back and once you open it

486
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,839
it's firm it holds and whatever I'm

487
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:50,480
trying to train stays the way I want it

488
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:53,279
to to go so um basically I was just

489
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,440
trying to like see if I could um trade

490
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,879
my plants a little lower at a lower

491
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,519
point because if you could get away with

492
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,440
using the way I thought of if I could

493
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:03,038
tie two or three branches down and it

494
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,200
make a difference a little

495
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:06,919
shorter I just wanted to see what that

496
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,960
would do and you know I just didn't I

497
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:12,600
didn't like the way it worked out for

498
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,919
me now with with that said um when it

499
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:17,079
comes to training a plant tying the

500
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:19,919
plant down like you just said uh couple

501
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:22,879
of my friends found that they they like

502
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,000
using like kind of like a more firm

503
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,520
trellis because of the fact that

504
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,240
sometimes when you when you pull a

505
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:30,960
branch down you'll have it down you know

506
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,200
and a recalibrate it's like what I like

507
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,919
to call it when it recalibrates comes

508
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,240
back up towards the

509
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,799
light sometimes these taller plants the

510
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,240
like branches just go like this way on

511
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:45,240
you for no reason and it's just not as

512
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,839
uh organized that's why I

513
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,159
um I still got to get you to try one of

514
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,359
my trist units Yeah you mentioned

515
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:53,480
umbrella and I'm sure that sparked a lot

516
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,759
of people's interest I'm sure there's a

517
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,519
lot of people that haven't even heard of

518
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:58,119
it can you talk to us about uh it's

519
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:00,079
actually your product right you created

520
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:03,439
this it looks like an umbrella it's a

521
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:07,199
trellis net talk to us about that so

522
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,200
yeah I got uh 5 years ago just I kept um

523
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,679
basically uh kind of like lollipop in my

524
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,240
plant speaking I know we're going to get

525
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,798
there but um so when I was training uh

526
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,159
this plant called Gorilla Glue that

527
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,639
everybody had in like 2015 you know

528
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:22,760
that's when I got it and um I kind of

529
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:25,280
like been growing it ever since

530
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:27,079
um so what was happening is this plant

531
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,200
grew perfect and when I would lollipop

532
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:30,519
it it just it looked like the reflection

533
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,880
of an umbrella

534
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:36,839
so um basically I I um I just didn't

535
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,000
want to do like your traditional PVC

536
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:43,720
when you're not using it usually like

537
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,519
you can't really uh detach or retract it

538
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,038
or anything like that it wasn't easy to

539
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:50,798
store cuz like I tried it a couple times

540
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:53,200
and I didn't like how it would just be

541
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:56,359
not easy to store basically

542
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,200
so I want to do something different and

543
00:20:56,359 --> 00:21:01,000
I seen this umbrella reflection coming

544
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,600
out of the you know what I was looking

545
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,119
at and that's when I decided to pull the

546
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:08,798
trigger on it and you know 5 years later

547
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:11,519
now I I've really really

548
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:13,278
um I really got it to the point where

549
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,720
it's it's a really good formula I wait

550
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:17,400
till my plants are about 10 in tall and

551
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,360
what happens is I'll top it right around

552
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,919
there the branches will come out and

553
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:24,000
I'll have two perfect branches and

554
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,038
because this genetic called uh wiie

555
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,679
Pebbles that capulator the breeder

556
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:29,038
actually made it's an exclusive genetic

557
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,200
nobody really got

558
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:34,839
has access to it but uh I got it that's

559
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,840
a whole another story and

560
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:39,918
um these this plant grows very very

561
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:43,199
vertical it just grows very stretchy it

562
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,320
grows like a like a like a solid diesel

563
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,679
that I grew in the past like really tall

564
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:50,119
and um I would get I would hand it out

565
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:52,278
to people and they'd be like I give up I

566
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:53,959
don't want this plant anymore that's it

567
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:56,480
and I be like what're like I can't get

568
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,558
it to produce I mean you top this plant

569
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,240
and it just instead of like it like the

570
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:02,440
will glue we would top it and the

571
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,919
branches would just kind of like grow

572
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,558
like that and it just be like this

573
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,600
perfect Bush after you top it this plant

574
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,759
you would top it and then you just have

575
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:13,240
another Branch right on the side of it

576
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:14,919
it wouldn't even and then it just be the

577
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,679
same amount of branches it had just all

578
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:21,080
going up and and it wouldn't really fill

579
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,600
anything in so um I didn't understand

580
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:24,199
what anybody was talking about cuz I was

581
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:27,359
working on this product when I got this

582
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,640
genetic so when I hand out my product to

583
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,599
people and they're like oh this produce

584
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,000
me so much more flour and this that and

585
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,240
the other and I wish I would have got it

586
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,159
earlier and like I wish I would have you

587
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,679
know just listen to you two years ago

588
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,480
I'm like relax you got it that's all

589
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,880
that

590
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,839
matters point is they're like this

591
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,039
actually makes more production like I

592
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:46,720
really get more production out of it but

593
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,359
like I said I've been using it so long I

594
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,798
don't realize anything anymore I just

595
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:53,719
keep you know using my

596
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:55,200
formula so after 10 in once once the

597
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,600
plant gets really stretchy because it's

598
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,400
a stretchy plant and I'm actually

599
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:02,399
forcing this plant to look bushy so what

600
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,880
happens is you get those two branches

601
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,880
then the other two are going to follow

602
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,240
and even in some cases if you don't get

603
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,919
the trellis on it early enough it's very

604
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,839
forgiving cuz what'll happen is um first

605
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:17,600
off it's a it's a portable trellis it's

606
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:21,798
just it's basically uh designed just for

607
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:24,399
the the single plant and what happens is

608
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:25,440
if if you don't get the trellis on it

609
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,200
early enough and you don't startop

610
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,360
training it early enough you can go

611
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,679
ahead and let it just get tall and kind

612
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:34,519
of out of control on you and then when

613
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,919
you get this trellis on it if you if

614
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:38,278
you've train trained the branches

615
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,200
outward and there's still like a a foot

616
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:42,880
or two of like this plant just going up

617
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,519
again now I decided where if the plant

618
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,320
is healthy again back to the healthy

619
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:48,038
part because if it's not healthy there's

620
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:49,240
no way you're going to pull this off if

621
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:51,839
you got purple

622
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,319
stems once this Branch goes back up I

623
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:57,558
then pull it back down and all the

624
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:59,399
satellites that were going off of it now

625
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:01,240
all like just kind kind of

626
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,640
like Get

627
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,120
recalibrated and literally the energy

628
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,400
leaves that that that the upper po of

629
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:10,278
this this branch that I pull over the

630
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,400
energy like you go back like a week or

631
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:14,640
two later and that thing's done it just

632
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,880
kind of goes up like 6 or seven Ines and

633
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,320
that's all you're getting out of it but

634
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,720
then you could get

635
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:23,240
nine eight eight eight to even 10

636
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,079
branches just going off of that one that

637
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:28,480
are like it just it puts that main

638
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:31,720
branch to shame what like the way the

639
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,480
oxin get distributed to the all the way

640
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,399
the the branches furthest away from the

641
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,640
one you just pulled is going to be the

642
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:40,639
thickest brus and then they're all going

643
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,720
to be just gorgeous branches going up

644
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,480
and you can just create your own canopy

645
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,759
when when you uh when you're in control

646
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,000
of of your Ghana like that and you know

647
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,798
when it's an art and you're trying to

648
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,119
grow craft flower you know it's it just

649
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:56,918
it's it's it's a beautiful thing to

650
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:59,038
watch it feels like an art and it gives

651
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:02,038
you more time to

652
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,119
you know clean broom you know mop your

653
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:05,599
your garden make sure it's clean because

654
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:07,599
you're more efficient you're you're not

655
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:09,038
spending time grabbing a piece of rope

656
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:10,959
tying it down grabbing a piece of rope

657
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:13,359
tying it down that's okay for the guy

658
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,960
with four plants in a in a tent but when

659
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,678
you're a micro grow and you got you're

660
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,360
like basically a caregiver for a few

661
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:22,200
people and you're you're growing on a

662
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:24,119
larger scale then even if it's a

663
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,960
basement you know what I mean like it's

664
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:28,759
it's nice to be able

665
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,759
to create that beautiful art and train a

666
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:32,440
plant the way you see them being trained

667
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:33,319
but not put that much physical labor

668
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,798
into

669
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:37,678
it that's what that's what basically why

670
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:38,918
I did it it looks like an interesting

671
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,640
concept and definitely something I want

672
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:43,840
to try out in the future uh because I do

673
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,240
find myself growing those tall plants

674
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:50,639
and not wanting to tie down as much

675
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,319
these days as I used to and I I think

676
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,679
just putting that umbrella chalice in

677
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,918
and being able to spread it out it seems

678
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:57,038
like it would be a little bit easier

679
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,559
than doing all those ties like you

680
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:02,079
mentioned now my my question is I do

681
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:03,759
want to I do want to butt in on that I

682
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:05,960
if you could hold your thought on that

683
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,480
so I I you're saying that you don't like

684
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,159
training your plants and basically what

685
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,960
happens is they go vertical and I love

686
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:14,640
vertical growth like that's actually

687
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,679
where I get my production from is once I

688
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,240
plant um train the plants to grow

689
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,559
horizontal um I Then I then pretty much

690
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,159
just leave them alone

691
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:26,558
and really it just it just looks like a

692
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,520
bunch of small plants on the side of

693
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:30,038
each other so there's nothing wrong

694
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:32,119
we're growing plants that just go

695
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:34,519
straight up if that's if that's what

696
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:36,119
you're happy with and you know how to

697
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:38,079
you have the right light that penetrates

698
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:41,079
down to that lower canopy you're going

699
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:42,759
to get more production vertically and uh

700
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:45,278
some people don't find it to be a pretty

701
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:47,200
looking site but if you do it just right

702
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,640
lollipop improving your maintenance your

703
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,600
plants you'll get um you get more

704
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,200
production that way vertical yeah I

705
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:54,519
sorry I wasn't bashing it or anything

706
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,720
like that of just it's just people get

707
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:58,879
really uh you know when it comes to

708
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,600
Growing it's people want to fight with

709
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,120
you and like that's why I like I like uh

710
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,439
platforms like yours and it' be awesome

711
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:09,558
if I can come on like other platforms

712
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,600
and just have like a a nice civil debate

713
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:13,398
with people on um these conversations

714
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,639
and nobody has to punch nobody in the

715
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:17,038
face yeah exactly but what I was saying

716
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,919
is basically like just the time

717
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:21,158
consuming that it takes to to tie down

718
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:23,960
plants so not so much disliking the

719
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:26,039
shape but more so like the time spend to

720
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,360
to tie things out but I still do it um

721
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:29,679
anyways back to my question was about

722
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:31,639
the umbrella's trellis I just want to

723
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,440
know like what are the dimensions of it

724
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,799
like are you like when you put the

725
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,798
trellis in are you just shoving it down

726
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:39,960
into the soil like a steak like you

727
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:41,798
typically do with a steak how far down

728
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,360
does it go into the soil like how does

729
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:47,599
that work so um basically I I basically

730
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:51,639
been working on two different bases or

731
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:53,719
STS um and what it is is one is I kind

732
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,880
of make them custom to whoever like say

733
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,360
like you reach out to me you're like

734
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,159
look I got this situation going on and a

735
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,240
lot of times I will consult with people

736
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:01,600
and try to tell them what are you trying

737
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,000
to do how many plants are you trying to

738
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:07,319
have and you do want to commit to this

739
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,798
style because um you know once you buy

740
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:12,240
these you're kind of committed to that

741
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:14,359
style so what I do is uh I have

742
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,440
umbrellas all the way from 2 feet all

743
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:19,719
the way to like

744
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:22,600
4T and I recently started making them

745
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,640
Square uh the stands go in the soil and

746
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:26,240
they made about 13 in out they they're

747
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,759
really made to go into like 20 gallon

748
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,519
pots the ones I make for myself and

749
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:33,038
and local Growers but I make them

750
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,240
smaller for anybody for whatever they're

751
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:38,278
trying to do and um I make them like a

752
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,399
little shorter than the pot so that like

753
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:44,679
there's like 4 in of give so that uh so

754
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:45,959
that because I realized to put it

755
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:48,519
actually in the

756
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,880
soil I got I got more results so I had

757
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:51,440
to go back to that I was kind of like

758
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,360
putting it out and over and I was like

759
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,120
you know what I'm going to just make

760
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:56,798
sure that there's an inch if you could

761
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:58,719
just get an inch of soil over that thing

762
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:01,119
I mean those roots anchor it and then

763
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,200
that's it and usually the best time to

764
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,558
use it is on transplant so you know

765
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,080
you're going to transplant your plants

766
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:08,839
then that's a good opportunity to put

767
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:11,480
the stand in cuz it's just a stand so

768
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:13,759
what happens is uh you don't have to use

769
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,360
the umbrellas right away you can kind of

770
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,879
just get that stand in there and then

771
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,918
worry about that later and another

772
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,559
reason why there are different tears to

773
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,919
it is so that if you want to put a

774
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:25,639
two-footer still make it through the

775
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:27,159
door you can and you know go to your uh

776
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,919
you know flower room with it and not

777
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:31,519
have any

778
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:33,120
uh you know like uh a plant that can't

779
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,919
make it through a door I just had a

780
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,359
brain F I don't know

781
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:38,399
why but I didn't I didn't want to run

782
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,278
into

783
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:43,000
like having

784
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:45,880
a not be able to grab my plant from here

785
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,640
and move it over there basically so that

786
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,240
there was um you know that's why I came

787
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,200
up with that and then then once you get

788
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,440
into flower room if you want to put a

789
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,399
bigger umbrella on it you don't have to

790
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,880
worry about um you know space

791
00:29:57,398 --> 00:30:00,719
restrictions through a door or anything

792
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,880
like that you could pull this other

793
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,839
umbrella out that's actually way bigger

794
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,799
put it on or if it's even if it's not

795
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:10,439
it's just I made it that way for uh

796
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:13,319
people to have more options and be able

797
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,600
to be more uh mobile more access to

798
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:16,798
every side of that room say your

799
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:18,199
electrician needs to get in your

800
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:20,679
electrical panels on the other side of

801
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,600
the room you could just pot the seas in

802
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:25,480
like 2 minutes you know and you throw

803
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:27,000
the second tier on whenever you want you

804
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,960
throw the third tier fourth tier you can

805
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,558
just keep going with tiar

806
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,480
and like I said that's where vertical

807
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:36,639
production comes from where it um and I

808
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:41,798
have to give a shout out to uh to cron

809
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:46,640
Don gross cron under uh CH h r o n

810
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:48,798
eore don gross because um he inspired me

811
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,278
between him and um the northern scr

812
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,558
Northern scroger taught me some

813
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:54,480
techniques on how to kind of like make

814
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:57,038
sure you don't um tangle the wrong

815
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,480
branches like when you're opening it up

816
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,038
it's one thing to focus on that but

817
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,639
don't let the branch get like Tangled

818
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:05,240
under the trellis get the right branches

819
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:06,759
to go up again so uh got to give him a

820
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,200
shout out we would have conversations

821
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:10,000
all the time and he would tell me how

822
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,038
ugly the big plants are he doesn't like

823
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,480
them at all but it's it's all good well

824
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:16,359
it sounds awesome I'm definitely going

825
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,038
to check out your channel again or your

826
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:19,240
Instagram page I should say and I think

827
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:21,000
you have a website and stuff like that

828
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,880
I'll definitely link your Instagram down

829
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,558
in the YouTube description section below

830
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,600
so those folks that are tuning in on

831
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:28,440
this can click on your Instagram check

832
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:32,199
it out they can see the umbrella trellis

833
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,759
in action and uh yeah let's move on to

834
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,480
lollipopping you mentioned that a couple

835
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:37,839
different times some people consider

836
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,399
this form of training other people

837
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:41,918
consider it a form of pruning whatever

838
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,319
way you think of it well we'll uh we'll

839
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,919
still cover it here today because it can

840
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,359
definitely be very beneficial when it

841
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,600
comes to helping to maximize yield talk

842
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:53,199
to us about lollipopping what is it and

843
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:56,199
how do you go about it so so lollipop

844
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,759
and is pruning it's just the word that I

845
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,278
think if you ask me on uh you know my my

846
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:02,679
Outlook on it I think it's just a word

847
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:05,079
that we we

848
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:07,240
used to describe

849
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:11,278
pruning because that's basically what it

850
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:14,638
is you're pruning the plant and um

851
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,720
so nowadays uh pruning is very important

852
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:18,558
because you just don't want to be

853
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,798
sitting there trimming little

854
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:25,798
flowers so um if you don't want to it's

855
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:27,398
it's almost like uh you know cry now

856
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:29,558
laugh later because you're not going to

857
00:32:27,398 --> 00:32:30,839
be sitting there killing yourself later

858
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:35,038
on when it's time to trim if you

859
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:37,879
lollipop just right also it frees up

860
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:40,200
microclimates um from happening where

861
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,799
bugs can hide and mold can be

862
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,679
created and all these issues can happen

863
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:46,440
inside there cuz you're looking at your

864
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:49,519
thermostat in the room and it says 60

865
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,600
but is it really 60 you know so it's

866
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,638
going to help you uh stay away from

867
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:56,798
issues it's going to help air flow it's

868
00:32:53,638 --> 00:33:00,119
going to help in my opinion the quality

869
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:03,158
of your flow like like when when my I

870
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:05,158
don't I don't run into like quality

871
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:07,080
problems and I think that has a little

872
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:09,480
bit to do with it that's a that's a part

873
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:11,759
in the fact that I grow quality yeah

874
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,759
when I do lollipopping I usually do the

875
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,919
lower third sometimes the lower fourth I

876
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,879
think a lot of people make the mistake

877
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,840
of going too high up when they're

878
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,399
lollipopping and uh ends up stunting the

879
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:23,839
growth of the plant you know they do it

880
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:25,199
right before stretch and they don't get

881
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:27,480
the stretch that they think they're

882
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,278
going to get then all of a sudden they

883
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,159
they

884
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:31,798
have poor production straightforward so

885
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,639
I think another thing I want to talk

886
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:36,960
about with the lollipop and is uh sorry

887
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:40,759
to cut you off but um so I do it four

888
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,600
times a veg I I want to say a plant gets

889
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:47,638
about four defoliations of vegetation it

890
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:49,359
gets about 3 to four in flower and uh

891
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:52,638
speaking of like shock on the plant we

892
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:55,678
never do too much at one time we kind of

893
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:58,959
um try to do so much at a time and the

894
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,960
reason why I do more late in flower too

895
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,360
like about 21 days to like you know that

896
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,278
that that 20 to 30 day period I I still

897
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:08,519
get in there because then you really

898
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:12,519
start seeing these little flowers that

899
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:13,918
just aren't going to make the cut and

900
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:16,039
it's really important for me to have

901
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,679
quality flowers so I just take off the

902
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:20,119
little tiny flowers that just H they're

903
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:23,079
not going to turn into

904
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:25,480
anything so we go all the way until like

905
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:28,440
day 30 got it that makes sense yeah last

906
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:32,000
time I will actually do the ly popping

907
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:34,200
is uh typically it's around day 21 in

908
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,918
flour but even like during flow you can

909
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:38,960
get some stuff kind of growing down

910
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:40,239
there so I usually kind of maintain that

911
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,599
continue to kind of pluck off those

912
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,078
little buds that are growing down on the

913
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,838
lowers even into flowering just to make

914
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,720
sure that uh don't end up with that

915
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:50,918
popcorn lury stuff at the end of the

916
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:52,078
grow so topping let's get into that I

917
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:53,838
there's quite a few people who do

918
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,440
topping and there are so many different

919
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:56,918
ways to go about it I mean when I first

920
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,440
started out I was letting the plant grow

921
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:00,920
to the fifth node then top and down to

922
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,240
the third then I was you know next time

923
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,800
around let the plant grow up to the

924
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,919
fifth node top at that fifth node and

925
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,920
let those lower branches grow up there's

926
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,680
a bunch of different ways to go about it

927
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,400
what do you do for topping um so I had a

928
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:14,000
friend who would like always just top

929
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,039
top top top top and not do plant

930
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,800
maintenance I'd be like dude like take

931
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:22,920
care of the plants he got like really

932
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,599
just gun hole with the whole topping um

933
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,680
as far as topping goes with me I weigh

934
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:28,559
10 in let the plant create the Y

935
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:31,519
structure that I like to

936
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:34,519
um you know my

937
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:37,519
terminology it creates that y let it

938
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:38,880
open it up once that happens um

939
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:41,320
sometimes the plant don't grow perfect

940
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,519
and even so there'll be like one branch

941
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,920
that just like outows a canopy later on

942
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:48,480
like early veg late flow I'll come in

943
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,000
I'll top that one but another you know

944
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,240
like usually when it's like late in veg

945
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,199
I'll start to try to flatten my canopy

946
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:57,879
out so I just come in and find the

947
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:00,279
tallest Branch top it then I'll wait

948
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,760
until another plant another Branch

949
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:06,800
passes the canopy and then come and top

950
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:09,800
it but it's more of a for me it's more

951
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,519
of like a place and time for it I

952
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,640
completely agree I have I usually grow a

953
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:16,199
variety of different cultivars and often

954
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,078
times I'll get that one cultivar that

955
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:21,239
just grows slower it stays squater and

956
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:23,480
then this other one uh just happens to

957
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:26,279
just have longer inter nodes grow faster

958
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,800
so like those ones I'll top more often

959
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,000
and allow my other plants that are

960
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,880
growing slower or stand squater to kind

961
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,599
of catch up a little bit because often

962
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,280
times they growing in one grow tent and

963
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,559
I have to flip that whole tent of flower

964
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,119
at once so just kind of utilizing

965
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:41,000
training on some plants to control the

966
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,760
height while the other plants catch up

967
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,639
is is certainly beneficial and Topping

968
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,800
does you know it can certainly if you're

969
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:49,879
doing topping and low stress training

970
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,800
you can certainly manipulate the plant

971
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,960
and train the plant to be more of a

972
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,800
wider structure have more main colas

973
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,240
coming up and can certainly increase

974
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,079
your overall yield so I'm definitely

975
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:03,039
glad we covered topping because that is

976
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:04,680
uh one of the main high stress trading

977
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:07,639
techniques that a lot of people use in

978
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:09,799
order to try to increase yield yep and

979
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:11,199
it's all about a leveled canopy and

980
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,920
that's where toping will help you out

981
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,559
you're just making sure you're nothing

982
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,440
you're not letting anything

983
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:19,759
get like this you don't you don't want

984
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,760
something low and something High yep if

985
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,200
you do get branches one get low one get

986
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,640
high one thing I usually do is

987
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,318
particularly in flower when I can't do

988
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:28,279
any other type of training is super

989
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:30,279
cropping to bend that Branch down and

990
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,920
allow the other ones to to catch up do

991
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,640
you do any super cooping at all can you

992
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,480
talk about what that is and when you

993
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:37,279
usually do it if you do it yeah I'm

994
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,559
happy you brought that up because uh I I

995
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,519
don't really use it because um you know

996
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:44,679
like I said earlier once you get that

997
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:46,880
knuckle um and flower it's okay to get

998
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:50,719
it because um you're not really trying

999
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,800
to train it after that um I don't do uh

1000
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:55,318
super crabbing because I'm not in a low

1001
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,560
sealing

1002
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:59,519
situation uh I noticed that after I

1003
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:01,039
super crop it the the the branch no

1004
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:04,280
longer wants a stretch and that's where

1005
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:06,079
I get my production from where um these

1006
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,760
new genetics they kind of just like grow

1007
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,240
stretchy and they Stack Up far apart

1008
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,839
from each other those are the genetics I

1009
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:17,199
love so I actually don't like my plant

1010
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:18,838
to do that so I don't do super croing

1011
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:21,598
that's the experience I have with it got

1012
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:23,440
it yeah know uh pigeons 420 I don't know

1013
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:27,519
if you know who he is I'm on a podcast

1014
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,400
with him you do he uh funny guy he super

1015
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:31,719
CRS every single branch which I thought

1016
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,720
was just super interesting and when it's

1017
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:37,759
young as well because he wants to build

1018
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:38,879
up that strength in the branches so uh

1019
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,800
you know there's so many different ways

1020
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,039
to go about it I personally only super

1021
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,200
crop in like in flowering the first

1022
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:47,400
three weeks when I have that stretch

1023
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:49,439
period and one of the branches or or

1024
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,639
some of the branches get up and grow

1025
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,358
over the other ones I'll supercrop those

1026
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:56,318
ones only in order to try to maintain

1027
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:58,960
that even in that situation it really

1028
00:38:56,318 --> 00:39:01,838
does I've done it before I'm not a

1029
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,800
master at it but I've done it and um a

1030
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:05,679
friend of mine does it as well and I go

1031
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,760
by I look at his grow and I like it you

1032
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:10,598
know it works great for the the

1033
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,200
application he's in yeah he's in a he's

1034
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:15,079
in a tent so I get it and like you said

1035
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,598
there's certain branches that you know

1036
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:20,079
you kind of want to do to get it to all

1037
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,838
just be that level canopy yeah it can

1038
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,800
make sense for many different

1039
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,920
applications let's get into defoliation

1040
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,480
this is another thing where some people

1041
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,039
consider it training other people

1042
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,400
consider it a form of pruning uh either

1043
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:37,079
way a lot of people claim that it does

1044
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,039
increase yield so figured we get into

1045
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:41,519
that today do you do any type of

1046
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:44,960
defoliation at all if so when do you do

1047
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:47,599
it uh I do well when I do when I say I'm

1048
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,760
doing uh lollipop and I'm pretty much uh

1049
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,119
defoliating um I mean I know they're

1050
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,960
both different because um sometimes you

1051
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:57,960
go with a focus that you're going to

1052
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,800
lollipop and prune and defol

1053
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,599
sometimes could just be you going like

1054
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,200
into your flower room usually is where I

1055
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:07,400
would defoliate and just take leaves off

1056
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:10,159
where they

1057
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,440
so what I was taught a long time ago and

1058
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:15,118
this is kind of a technique I still use

1059
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:19,960
I I grow these kind of like big plants

1060
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:23,000
so I'll try to create a circle of light

1061
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,838
penetration and I'll pick off a leaf

1062
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,960
that's on this side a leaf that's on

1063
00:40:24,838 --> 00:40:28,880
this side another one this way and this

1064
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,639
way and I'll just go in a circle

1065
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,640
defoliating I'll focus on that one

1066
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,159
little area and once it looks like

1067
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:37,279
there's light penetrating to the bottom

1068
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,879
I'll move on to another Circle p and

1069
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,040
I'll just start doing that I'll go in a

1070
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,559
circle with taking leaves off and that

1071
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,159
allows that penetration all the way down

1072
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:47,199
huh okay are you only doing that in veg

1073
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:49,399
or you doing that in flour as well some

1074
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:52,078
people do it in late flour as well yeah

1075
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,720
I do that mainly in flour mainly in

1076
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,400
flower to allow the light to get in

1077
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:59,000
there I don't I I can't think of a time

1078
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,920
that I'm defoliating in and not

1079
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,400
lollipopping when I'm doing it any other

1080
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,358
time so if I'm in veg I'm just either

1081
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,440
when I'm lollipopping I am defoliating

1082
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:09,318
those things can definitely go hand

1083
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,920
inand that's for sure speaking of uh

1084
00:41:09,318 --> 00:41:13,559
people you said people use it as a

1085
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,280
training technique and I've noticed that

1086
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:19,279
uh I think Beast Coast does it as well

1087
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:21,560
he learned it from uh the Master grandm

1088
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,319
Level Grand Master Level he learned that

1089
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:25,599
if you take these leaves off at the top

1090
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:27,480
these big leaves that actually trains

1091
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,800
the plant too so that's pretty pretty

1092
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,719
cool little technique that I you know I

1093
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,720
just learned just watching people but

1094
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,399
that's that's a cool little uh thing one

1095
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:39,159
of the things I like to do is really

1096
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,280
focus on defoliating like the center

1097
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:43,838
like in the middle of the canopy going

1098
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,040
down in and kind of leaving those outer

1099
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:48,920
ones mostly mostly towards like the

1100
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:50,679
bottom of the plant the the outer around

1101
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,480
I like to leave those big bottom leaves

1102
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:54,318
there often times because that could and

1103
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,639
I call it the skirt method actually cuz

1104
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:59,639
it kind of looks like a skirt in a sense

1105
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:02,358
um the reason why is because if you're

1106
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:04,519
coming across a deficiency right things

1107
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:06,519
happen right the nutrition things could

1108
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:09,000
get out of balance in the medium and you

1109
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:11,480
could start seeing signs of deficiency

1110
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,679
that helps right to be able to see that

1111
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,760
happening because if you take off the

1112
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:16,318
leaves well then you you kind of screwed

1113
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,680
in that sense because then you you you

1114
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:21,039
don't really see the deficiency as well

1115
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:22,440
as if you had those lowers so I fig I'd

1116
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:25,000
mentioned the skirt technique is kind of

1117
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,480
leaving those lowers as an indicator so

1118
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,519
you could see if you're seeing a

1119
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,159
deficiency or not I had a friend of mine

1120
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:32,440
that just told me not to leave the skirt

1121
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:33,759
there cuz I used to and ever since then

1122
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,400
I just stopped doing it so there's no

1123
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,880
Rhyme or Reason but I don't leave the

1124
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:41,119
skirt there yeah I mean what are you

1125
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,720
talking about vegetation or flour I

1126
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,519
usually do the defoliation in like veg

1127
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:47,480
before flipping the flower and then I'll

1128
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:50,880
keep it and you leave the skirt on yep

1129
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:53,960
and then I'll keep it into flower uh the

1130
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,680
first 3 weeks I usually defoliate I'll

1131
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,880
look to defoliate on day s day 14 and

1132
00:42:56,679 --> 00:43:01,598
day 2 want but often times it doesn't

1133
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,119
need to be defoliated that often

1134
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,318
genetics is going to depend on it of

1135
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,960
course uh but yeah I'll leave that that

1136
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:09,159
skirt all the way through there I don't

1137
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,240
I don't you know never really saw harm

1138
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:12,598
in leaving that skirt the only thing if

1139
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:13,558
there's a lack of air flow then yeah

1140
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:15,240
you're going to I'm going to pull off

1141
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:16,640
the leaves there but other than that

1142
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:18,039
I'll just leave those bottom leaves

1143
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:20,239
there you leave them all the way through

1144
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:22,800
too huh yep So Different Strokes for

1145
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:24,199
different folks no I mean I like I said

1146
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,318
I don't do it but there not a rhyme a

1147
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:28,039
reason why I don't do it all right well

1148
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:29,719
uh we covered quite a few I think the

1149
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:32,358
only thing we didn't really cover was

1150
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:34,039
fing and I think if remember correctly

1151
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:36,920
last time we spoke you don't do any type

1152
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:39,159
of fimming right no I don't do fine cuz

1153
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,240
uh I'm just not something I ever got

1154
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:44,558
into plus um it kind of creates more

1155
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:47,078
branches and I'm not too crazy about

1156
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:49,720
more branches in that in in certain

1157
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:51,880
scenarios okay are there any other PL

1158
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:54,318
training techniques that we didn't cover

1159
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,039
that you'd like to talk about no I think

1160
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:58,239
uh we pretty much covered everything

1161
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:01,558
like I said I just uh usually pull my

1162
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:03,639
plants out but if if I uh if I'm

1163
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:05,559
slacking and my plants get Too Tall I'll

1164
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:06,879
usually come back and wrap it around the

1165
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:10,400
outside which

1166
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,358
is you know basically covered that so I

1167
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,280
think I think we're pretty good as far

1168
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:16,358
as

1169
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,319
uh PL training nice I appreciate you

1170
00:44:16,358 --> 00:44:20,358
coming on to the podcast and revealing

1171
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:22,159
your training techniques just want to I

1172
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:26,039
think if I could shed light on anything

1173
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:28,920
it would be that um my first trellis is

1174
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:30,719
is simply to train the plant the second

1175
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,639
trellis is to support the middle

1176
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:36,439
branches and the third plant I mean uh

1177
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:37,358
trellis is to uh support the upper part

1178
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,400
of the

1179
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:42,759
branches so you know to anybody out

1180
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,160
there that can like you know I encourage

1181
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,720
you to try it both

1182
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,879
ways really I encourage you to not train

1183
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:51,598
them after after you trained them the

1184
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,440
first time but if you want to do an

1185
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,800
experiment go ahead and you'll see that

1186
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,440
um it just works a lot better when you

1187
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:02,200
just let the plant just go up after

1188
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,559
that that's how you get the the colas if

1189
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,439
you keep just training and training

1190
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:06,559
branches you end up with skinnier

1191
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,280
branches and then you end up with

1192
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:12,800
skinnier flow oh smaller smaller flowers

1193
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,760
I've made that mistake before uh you

1194
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,359
know continuing to train all the way

1195
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,040
till stretch was done and all of a

1196
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:21,440
sudden I have these uh this real small

1197
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,000
flat plant which uh doesn't really grow

1198
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,519
up much and the buds are just kind of

1199
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,039
all Consolidated and a yeah it's and

1200
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:28,519
then sometimes you got to Branch hand

1201
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:31,440
then you got this one here and then it's

1202
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:33,199
like you trained this one again and now

1203
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,079
you're just shading another one so it's

1204
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:39,358
like you got to kind of like pick when

1205
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:42,039
when's enough is enough on the training

1206
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:44,519
the topping with all of that good advice

1207
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:46,159
any other advice for maybe beginners who

1208
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:50,159
are just training for the first

1209
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:51,960
time just to find a good uh seed bank or

1210
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:53,799
genetic Bank uh you know somewhere you

1211
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,838
could get some good reliable

1212
00:45:53,800 --> 00:46:00,240
seeds um pretty much start off there uh

1213
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,960
get your environment under control uh

1214
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:04,318
tent is the best way to go about that

1215
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,920
cuz it retains everything a lot better

1216
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:08,838
than just trying to start off in a room

1217
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,400
that's going to not have uh any it's not

1218
00:46:08,838 --> 00:46:13,078
going to be able to retain as well so

1219
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,200
you know a tent's very

1220
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:17,880
efficient um make sure not to water too

1221
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:21,399
much cuz everybody makes that mistake

1222
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:23,079
when it comes to cloning don't at fill

1223
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,800
the thing up with water actually just

1224
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:26,079
leave a little bit at the bottom to

1225
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,920
where the roots actually have to go

1226
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,920
searching for it

1227
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:35,280
um and just uh if you're using LEDs make

1228
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:36,519
sure to keep you you could go as high as

1229
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,440
like

1230
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:41,800
87 and keep your humidity as high as up

1231
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,720
to 65 and you'll be fine if you could

1232
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:49,079
stay under that uh VPD for those LEDs

1233
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:50,598
you you do a lot better um HPS wasn't it

1234
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:54,440
it's not as uh it's a little more

1235
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:57,440
forgiven because of uh I guess uh they

1236
00:46:54,440 --> 00:47:00,880
say that the uh the HPS actually create

1237
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,280
heat so for you to for you to use a LED

1238
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,079
you have to kind of like run your room a

1239
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,359
little hotter to kind of buffer that

1240
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:10,000
whole difference

1241
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:12,078
so those few things I think are very

1242
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,960
important making sure you cuz the Clones

1243
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,960
are very important of course the um your

1244
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,079
environment for your plants is very

1245
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,440
important humidity is very important

1246
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:23,400
when they're small you could do them

1247
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,240
things and and and you get off to a good

1248
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:28,480
start all right good stuff so wrapping

1249
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:29,879
things up how can the listeners find you

1250
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,358
and do you have anything up coming in

1251
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:34,440
the future that you want to talk about

1252
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:36,558
pretty much uh nothing coming up in the

1253
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,318
future I just uh been just working on

1254
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:41,800
this project that I've been working on

1255
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:44,838
since forever now um the web trellis

1256
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:47,720
which is uh an idea that I patented and

1257
00:47:44,838 --> 00:47:49,719
um trying to get it out there just so

1258
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:51,000
people could see it use it kind of like

1259
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:53,759
grow with

1260
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,679
uh you know use use the uh the web

1261
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,280
trailer style in their

1262
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:01,078
Garden uh um it's always just you know

1263
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:06,720
it's an option and

1264
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:10,280
um I'm on Instagram as umbrella trellist

1265
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:12,078
and uh my backup is uh the web

1266
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,800
trellis

1267
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,200
um I'm going to actually uh that's

1268
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,400
pretty much it just going to be on there

1269
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:23,000
and um I am going to build

1270
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:24,639
my uh different different um social

1271
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,599
platforms up cuz right now it's

1272
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:29,639
basically only Facebook and IG but

1273
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,000
moving forward maybe even um get my

1274
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:33,239
YouTube channel

1275
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,400
going start growing some tomato plants

1276
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:38,039
or something and really start like

1277
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,480
crushing it and showing people how uh

1278
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:42,400
you get some really good production

1279
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,400
horizontal too it's not all just

1280
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,480
vertical awesome well like I mentioned

1281
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,800
earlier in the episode I'll definitely

1282
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,960
have a link to Josh's Instagram down in

you're on one of the podcast file forms

1285
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:54,319
