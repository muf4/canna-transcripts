you uh letting me come on here and Jab

76
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,879
with you for a little bit yeah it should

77
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,039
be a good conversation we're going to be

78
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:50,439
talking about your method of growing and

79
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,400
I'm excited to get into that because I

80
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:55,039
think a lot of people are going more

81
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,080
towards a more simplified approach to

82
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:00,318
nutrition right feeding a lot of people

83
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,040
going from synthetic to or organic

84
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,518
because they want to be more hands-off

85
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:05,318
that's one of the reasons why other

86
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,719
benefits of sure we could sit here and

87
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:09,079
talk for the next 15 minutes about the

88
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,719
benefits of that but we won't get into

89
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,640
that I want to get into your style of

90
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,799
gardening but first can you tell us a

91
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,359
little bit about yourself and how you

92
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:17,519
got into gardening uh yeah so uh

93
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,879
actually I kind of got the same story

94
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,039
everybody else does uh started uh you

95
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:26,679
know partaking in the medical plant

96
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:29,079
around the age 14 15 um and you know in

97
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,719
in that time the oppression was very

98
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,599
real so it was very hard to get my hands

99
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,359
on it uh so I decided one day I was

100
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,798
going to grow some uh and just like

101
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,680
everybody else my mom found it killed it

102
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,360
uh and then uh you know that that that

103
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,799
killed my drive for a little bit but you

104
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,200
know as I become an adult I was like I

105
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,760
really think I can do that uh especially

106
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,878
you know with all the the gardening

107
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,479
experience that I do have uh growing up

108
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:54,518
you know in Alabama there's a lot of

109
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:57,158
gardening a lot of farm Farmland so uh

110
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,319
is kind of like built into my culture uh

111
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:02,759
or to my to my background you know so it

112
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:06,359
kind of natural um and then it's a plant

113
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:11,479
you know or essentially a weed and um

114
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:13,239
it's it's very it's very um easy and if

115
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:15,759
you do it you know where you only have

116
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,478
to add water uh you it takes the

117
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,959
guesswork out of it you know it's it's

118
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:20,560
you put yourself on a schedule when you

119
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,040
want to add your amendments to it and

120
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,240
and the and the crazy part about all of

121
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,600
it is is the people that you buy the

122
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,199
Amendments from give you their take on

123
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,960
how you should mix it how you should add

124
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:33,520
it uh so if you follow that um and you

125
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,478
put it in a calendar is is it's very

126
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,038
very easy very easy so what would you

127
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:40,839
say your overall grow style is are you

128
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:43,918
in like soil or cocoa or Hydroponics are

129
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:47,038
you indoors Outdoors organic 100%

130
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:50,240
indoors um and yes organic uh all the

131
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:52,519
way um I I like to call myself a control

132
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,918
freak uh I like to be in control of of

133
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:58,560
all the situations so you start with a a

134
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,000
soil that has really nothing in it uh

135
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,839
and you can add your own make your own

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,160
magic and and you know um the crazy part

137
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:08,000
about uh Organics is they they it's a

138
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,680
symbiotic relationship so this works off

139
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,160
of this this works off of this and once

140
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,199
you figure out what this this and this

141
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,520
is and you put it all together all you

142
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,280
have to do is that water and you just

143
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:17,719
sit back and watch your your magic

144
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:19,239
happen you know of course there's an

145
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,120
environmental situation that you have to

146
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,759
take care of along the way but for the

147
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,879
most part there's no guessing there's no

148
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,240
mixing that that to me is complicated uh

149
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,639
and then you get somebody brand new to

150
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,560
this and they're like oh I wanted to try

151
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,160
the latest you know

152
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,639
uh Athena blend where I have to mix

153
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,039
everything together um and they do that

154
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,720
and their plants come out and they blame

155
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:39,918
it on Athena but no they they've never

156
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,360
done it before uh they don't know

157
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,719
exactly what they're getting their C

158
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,360
into uh so in my opinion you take all

159
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,319
the guesswork out of it and you only add

160
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,360
water there's there's

161
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,199
really there's there's not another way

162
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,000
to explain it honestly I don't think

163
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,000
makes it easier so you mentioned soil

164
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,120
you're starting off with pretty much

165
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,478
nothing can you kind of talk about what

166
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,800
is in your soil mix

167
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:06,519
yeah so uh Prix HP uh that's my go-to uh

168
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,400
because there's no there's not really

169
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:11,598
anything in there there there is maaz in

170
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:13,719
there uh but the as far as the

171
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:15,959
Amendments go is kind of kind of naked

172
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,919
so you you start you know adding your

173
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,560
own uh your own amendments and and I

174
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,680
like guy green um simply because Mr

175
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,800
Canucks kind of taught me everything I

176
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,120
know about the organic method you know

177
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,240
so I I stay true to guy green um uh

178
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:35,399
everything so the uh the Amendments that

179
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:38,079
I use are the 444 uh and the 384 I I do

180
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,399
you know per per bag I can't remember

181
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,918
exactly how much is in each bag uh but I

182
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,038
believe it's 3 tablespoons you know when

183
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:47,439
you first start making your soil it's 3

184
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:49,839
tablespoons per gallon of soil um of

185
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,839
each kind and then you know you only add

186
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,799
your your Bloom you know during your uh

187
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:58,478
flower stage obviously and then you you

188
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,079
add your um 284 so uh I add both of

189
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:01,918
those you know initially when I first

190
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,240
start mixing my soil uh at the very

191
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:07,120
beginning and then uh during Vegeta

192
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,120
vegetative stage it states on there you

193
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,120
know only add a tablespoon every four

194
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,319
weeks of the

195
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:18,360
284 and uh actually I do both so during

196
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:20,840
each during each top dressing I add uh a

197
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,680
tablespoon of each so every four weeks

198
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:26,119
my soil gets a tablespoon of each of the

199
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,280
gy green products um and I just mix it

200
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,720
in you know uh and then from there it's

201
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:36,478
uh stash blend every week so I I stash

202
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,479
blend you know probably from week two uh

203
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,000
all the way up to the very end uh minus

204
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:42,439
the last two weeks and I just started

205
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,240
doing the last two weeks of taking the

206
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:46,959
stash blend out uh simply because uh Rob

207
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,000
actually say something about recharge so

208
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,758
I picked up a little bit of recharge and

209
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,720
the last couple weeks that I actually

210
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,720
add stuff to my soil um or to my to my

211
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,639
water I I use recharge and take out the

212
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,039
stash blend uh and this last man is

213
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,478
amazing my battle

214
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:07,639
uh my battle of the Breeders uh tent it

215
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:09,839
was crazy it was one gon pots uh and um

216
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:13,038
very very large Harvest awesome okay so

217
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,198
your initial mix is Pete Moss well

218
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:17,680
actually it's I'm looking it up right

219
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:19,639
now spum Pete Moss 65 to 75% of that

220
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,800
then pearlite and then uh it's got some

221
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:24,439
dolomitic lime in it and then a wedding

222
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,918
agent as well is that promix HP very

223
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:28,000
popular I heard a lot of people using

224
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,198
that with a success I have yet to use

225
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,479
that mix but it's on my radar maybe

226
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,800
eventually I will try using that and so

227
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,158
then you're using the Gaia green 444 and

228
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,439
284 as the initial amending and then as

229
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:40,479
you go throughout the veg stage and

230
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,959
flower stage you're doing top dressings

231
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,959
of the Gaia green and then for additives

232
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,919
using stash plant and recharge is that

233
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,759
correct yes what container size are you

234
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,719
using are you in beds or you in large

235
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:55,639
containers or what well it varies so I

236
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,079
have uh a couple of different tents um I

237
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:01,480
have a 3X3 and in those I use five

238
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:03,559
gallon bags or gallon pots usually uh

239
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,879
and then in my I like to call it my

240
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:08,599
micro tense because I have a 2X 2x4 and

241
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,439
then I have a 1 and a half and by one

242
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,759
and a half by three uh and in those I

243
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,279
use one gallon putts um and I've kind of

244
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:18,559
been playing with that man um with the

245
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:21,720
with the small grow uh because of uh

246
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:23,719
like I like I try to figure out a way to

247
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,320
not spend a whole bunch of money on like

248
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,759
a hey Abby or something like that but

249
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,480
still kind of get you know the same

250
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:33,799
results um so I did the the the Solo Cup

251
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,278
grow and uh I made a reservoir out of a

252
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:39,559
16 oz water bottle uh and I used a wick

253
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,759
um like out of a torch you know what I

254
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:45,159
mean a fiberglass Wick and I I screwed

255
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,519
it into the side of a 16 oz Solo Cup um

256
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:48,000
and I did a whole grill with that you

257
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,320
know scragged it out and it it turned

258
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,480
out great as well and that was also in

259
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,440
my micro ENT so that was a a Solo Cup a

260
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,200
one gon bag and a 5 gallon bag got it

261
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,519
typically you hear of folks that who are

262
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,440
growing with Organic inputs such as

263
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,440
yourself they say the bigger the better

264
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,000
they say 10 gallons 15 Gallons 20

265
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,160
gallons have you ever thought about

266
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,639
going up that high or I have a 10 gon

267
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:13,240
bag um but I don't I don't grow anything

268
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:15,720
medical I grow a a a hibiscus tree out

269
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,440
of it right now and I'm thinking about

270
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,519
planting the bag itself so uh you know

271
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,200
you hear people do that and and and it's

272
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,240
a tree so the roots you know get kind of

273
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,120
large so I'm thinking about when it gets

274
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,240
you know where I feel like it can

275
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,679
sustain itself outside uh without having

276
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,839
a whole lot of care like I give it right

277
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,319
now I think I'm going to PL it but yes

278
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,800
it's all the same exact blend of

279
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,040
everything that I just said that I use

280
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:40,078
for my indoor medical growth uh my

281
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,439
outdoor trees get the same exact mixture

282
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:45,120
as well and it's amazing it really is

283
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,639
how how easy and and how uh Universal

284
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,919
all this stuff is with each other cuz

285
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:52,120
people think it's hard and it's it's

286
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,159
really it's all about perspective yeah a

287
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,639
lot of things overlap from plant to

288
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,838
plant now there are some differences but

289
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:00,399
I also grow other plants as well I grow

290
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,519
some leafy greens pepper Tomatoes things

291
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,159
like that I've got some trees that were

292
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,720
just recently planted citrus trees fig

293
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,480
pomegranates so I'm I'm new to all that

294
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,680
stuff but a lot of the stuff does

295
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,680
overlap and you can take some things

296
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,078
from there and implement it for

297
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,399
medicinal plants or vice versa so uh

298
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:19,278
yeah it's pretty cool to be able to

299
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:22,320
Branch out and do other plants besides

300
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,439
just the medicinal plants now for the

301
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,879
medicinal plants that you grow how big

302
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:31,519
of plants do you typically grow okay so

303
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:34,159
um in the 3X3 uh you know that tin is 6t

304
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,000
tall um and it

305
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:40,078
grows I grow very large plants in there

306
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,759
almost as tall as me cuz I'm 61 so I can

307
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,679
see over the top of the uh the ENT a

308
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,519
little bit but uh yeah I would say

309
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,479
almost uh as tall as a tent about 6ot

310
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:51,120
but I I try to keep it small because

311
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,920
what I've seen is the smaller the plant

312
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,639
is the more it seems to me the more

313
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:57,679
dense and heavy it fills out like what I

314
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:00,240
mean is is like the the actual plant

315
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,638
Stacks more if it's long and lanky you

316
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,079
know you've got if it's a 6ft tall plant

317
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,440
3 foot of that is just stem so I I've

318
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,479
never really understood why you would

319
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,880
grow a plant and put all that work in it

320
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,759
and let it grow that much and spend all

321
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:18,439
its time growing itself legs as opposed

322
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:21,480
to you know dense medical uh uh material

323
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,680
that you're looking for you know um so I

324
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,680
I found that the smaller plants you know

325
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,559
yield more I feel like um and I know

326
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,958
that's you know it's kind of B to say

327
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,518
but I feel that way uh and that's just

328
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,879
me you know anecdotally doing at my

329
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,560
house um I'm sure in a you know a huge

330
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:39,198
not homeg growth circumstance that's not

331
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:41,559
what they're looking for but you know at

332
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:43,719
home with me uh I found the shorter

333
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:46,838
plants are are much denser uh just for

334
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,240
instance this the last one um I I grew

335
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:52,959
uh atlas of seeds Atlas seed Sho of the

336
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,959
Hut and it was in that that one Harvest

337
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:59,638
over 100 G dried and it was a 1gallon

338
00:12:55,958 --> 00:13:01,278
pot so that's unheard of and it's I

339
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,198
couldn't believe it and I'm telling you

340
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:06,198
man they the colas were the size of my

341
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:07,799
forearms uh and a one gu my PT so that's

342
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:10,000
crazy I was going to ask you what size

343
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:12,879
container for those 6 foot plants in the

344
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,799
3X3 one gallon wow how long do you veg

345
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:18,360
for before flipping the flower uh five

346
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:20,479
weeks 6 weeks uh I I try to get it past

347
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,600
that regressive State you know the the I

348
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:27,000
heard somebody talking about um maybe it

349
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,759
was ramlan Jake from R ramlan genetics

350
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,198
he was talking about if you don't wait

351
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,720
at least six weeks the the the Herm

352
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:34,519
traits kind of like try to show

353
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,839
themselves a little bit earlier and it's

354
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:41,759
more of a a I forgot the word he used so

355
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,639
ever since that you know I I've started

356
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,958
looking at the time cuz before I was

357
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:46,639
terrible before I started getting into

358
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,919
the community I just did it I didn't

359
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,440
keep track of anything I mean I didn't

360
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:52,639
know what day I planted anything I don't

361
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,320
know I just went off the microscope uh

362
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,839
on the triom I don't know when I flipped

363
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,199
it to flower so now that I started

364
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,199
watching you know people that know what

365
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:02,359
they're doing that do this for living uh

366
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:04,319
I keep track of things and uh come to

367
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,039
find out I've been I've been flipping

368
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,240
you know in flower about a week about 4

369
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,278
and a half to week five uh and I was

370
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,959
having Herm issues and I didn't I didn't

371
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,278
understand why so then I I stretched it

372
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,399
out to the six weeks and flipped it into

373
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:20,000
flower five five and a half six weeks

374
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,559
and uh I have no more of those issues so

375
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,639
I don't know what it is and it's not it

376
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:26,039
was not with every plant um but you know

377
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,519
it kind of made sense what he was saying

378
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:31,000
once I put into perspective what I what

379
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:33,000
I deal with than what I see um does that

380
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,559
make sense yeah that's a strange one I

381
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,879
never heard that one before so 5 weeks

382
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:41,198
would be 35 days at the minimum that's

383
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,679
that's about what I'm doing I try to do

384
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:46,000
30 is my goal CU I grow smaller plants

385
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,719
as I I believe you know so I try to do a

386
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,720
short veg and flip the flower fast but

387
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,079
typically it will go 35 40 days in veg

388
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,440
at the minimum and then uh upwards of 60

389
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:59,239
70 days in veg if I'm trying to grow

390
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,160
kind of bigger plant but yeah I've never

391
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,560
heard that before as far as if you

392
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:05,159
flipped a flower too soon that you're

393
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,838
more likely to get a plant that shows

394
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:11,198
interx traits yes and uh you know it it

395
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:12,480
like I said I I compared my old stuff to

396
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,000
what I'm doing since I started keeping

397
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,920
track of everything and it and it does

398
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
seem to be in a thing um I haven't

399
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:20,559
delved into it enough to actually like

400
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,559
put out a scientific paper on it or

401
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,559
anything but it does seem to me that

402
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:29,000
there is something correspondence that

403
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:31,278
he's talking about there uh so um now I

404
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,240
I try to go five five and a half six

405
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,799
weeks and then I flip uh but I still

406
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:39,120
keep it low man I train I start training

407
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:41,559
instantly um as soon as I soon as I can

408
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,759
uh I start training uh that's because

409
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:45,198
like I said I'm used to growing in such

410
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,159
a small area um like growing up I had to

411
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,958
grow underneath my stairs and you know

412
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:52,039
that's not very tall so I had I had to

413
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:54,359
make do it what I had uh so I start

414
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:56,480
training early and I keep things low um

415
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,879
and still small plants you know so

416
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,600
you're talking about the plants in your

417
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:02,679
3x3 right how many plants are you

418
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,680
putting in a 3X3 and and yeah get into a

419
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:06,958
little bit more detail of your training

420
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:08,799
are you doing any topping at all or

421
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:12,119
super cropping or you just sticking with

422
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:15,078
like low stress training so uh it's a

423
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,000
great question actually I uh I do a

424
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:21,599
whole lot of low stress training um you

425
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,720
know bud Clips uh or Amazon's version of

426
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,920
bug Clips whatever uh whatever I got

427
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,759
laying around uh and you know from the

428
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:32,439
start uh I take and bend it straight

429
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:35,000
over over um I want to say week

430
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,360
two after it becomes not a Seedling

431
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,720
anymore after it starts actually

432
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,720
becoming a vegetative plant I start

433
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:44,480
folding it um and you know uh sometimes

434
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,920
I top I fold it first uh I let it grow

435
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,199
up uh just about a week I'll let it go

436
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:51,479
about a week and then if I need to top

437
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,159
it I'll top it then uh but then I start

438
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,319
trying to tie it down to the sides of

439
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,159
the bag so after I top it and it starts

440
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:59,679
splitting uh you know what I mean after

441
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:01,958
it starts uh coming up into a fork um

442
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,439
I'll take and I'll I'll take those after

443
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,759
about 2 weeks and tie them down to the

444
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,480
bag uh and then those inner inner shoots

445
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,679
start shooting up and I'll also do the

446
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,199
same thing with those I'll tie them down

447
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:13,400
to the to the bag uh and get kind of

448
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,919
like an umbrella at the bottom uh and

449
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,079
then I'll let the plants start growing

450
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:19,839
up uh and then that's when I start

451
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:22,198
utilizing bug Clips or or whatever

452
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,838
method I use uh cuz they're not always

453
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,038
bug Clips uh sometimes there are other

454
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:26,958
brands that I don't remember the names

455
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,679
of them uh but I will fold them over

456
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,600
with those uh and I'll let those B out

457
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,480
uh about 2 weeks so right there we're at

458
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,439
week five um and then sometimes if if I

459
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,640
feel like I need to grow or let it go a

460
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,960
little bit longer in veg um I will I

461
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,559
will let it do that and then I'll flip

462
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,279
it into flower the next week uh and then

463
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:48,079
start you know watching the real growth

464
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:50,359
happen cuz the stretch is

465
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,599
real how about pruning some of the

466
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:54,918
pruning techniques such as lollipopping

467
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:57,480
removing the lower third or quarter

468
00:17:54,919 --> 00:18:00,120
growth and also defoliation do you do

469
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:04,839
any of those things yes so so I I follow

470
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:07,239
pretty much um the the the the talk

471
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:11,879
around the town on defil so like it week

472
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:14,519
day 21 of uh veg uh week two week three

473
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,480
of flour I I'll do foliate a little bit

474
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:18,319
uh but yeah man I I know I've been doing

475
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,960
this so long I kind of know what's going

476
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,639
to grow and what's going to actually

477
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,640
mature into you know actual uh Bud that

478
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,240
you want uh so the like the lower third

479
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,400
of the plant I just take it all the way

480
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,839
off um because it I mean you know it

481
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,038
really doesn't even grow into flowers

482
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,798
when you dry it out it's like strings

483
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:37,200
it's not even really what you want at

484
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,279
all so why would you let your plant you

485
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,600
know focus on growing that when you know

486
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:42,720
that it's not going to produce what you

487
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:44,759
want it to so I trim that off from the

488
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,720
from the get-go and you know during the

489
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:49,759
flowering stage that stuff still tries

490
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,839
to grow so I keep it maintained um I

491
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,119
don't want anything I want all my I want

492
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,918
it all to be focused at the top of my

493
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,558
plant and if you go back and look at my

494
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:58,320
pictures on Instagram you'll see that

495
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:01,960
they all they all pretty much look the

496
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:05,639
same all of my all my plants do uh short

497
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,919
big fat nugs um and it's kind of like a

498
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,480
a motion that I'm in now uh it's the

499
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,038
same thing you know every day I've been

500
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,038
doing it so long it's just it's just I

501
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:16,640
know what to look for I know when I know

502
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:18,079
when something's not right um I don't

503
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,759
know how to always diagnose it I don't

504
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:20,798
know what all these diseases are but I

505
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,440
know when something's not right I know

506
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:26,639
how to monitor pH um and that's not

507
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,840
really an issue anymore pH since I went

508
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,919
to full Organics um Never As Long As I

509
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:35,199
feed it and give it water that's really

510
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:38,159
all it ask for got it yeah I do similar

511
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,759
training and pruning that you mention I

512
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:42,280
take off the lower about quarter or

513
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,759
lower third roughly for the lollipopping

514
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:46,399
and then defoliation around the same

515
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,158
time I try to avoid doing defoliation of

516
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,480
veg as much as possible to be honest

517
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:53,679
with you but some cultivar some strains

518
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,400
that I grow are just so thick you know

519
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,640
tight inner nodes very leafy or I have

520
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,120
other things that really are kind of

521
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,679
longer inner nodes less Leaf don't

522
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:04,158
really need as much pruning done so it

523
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:06,000
really depends on kind of what the

524
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,200
genetics are and how they grow out for

525
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,720
what I do but as far as day you had

526
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,880
mentioned day 21 of flower to really do

527
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,120
that defoliation that's typically when

528
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,640
I'm hitting it with its final

529
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:18,678
defoliation as well you know before Fant

530
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,080
flow I'll probably do it once I used to

531
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:23,759
do it on day seven and day 14 of flow

532
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:25,639
and then finally on day 21 but if I'm

533
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,720
able to push it and not do it until day

534
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,880
21 well then that's less times I have to

535
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,558
do it so I'm kind of uh similar to you

536
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,919
in that way and I like that it's not

537
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:37,000
really a need to so the thing about

538
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,759
gardening is somebody does it one way

539
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,400
somebody does it another way and it

540
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:42,038
doesn't mean that both of those ways are

541
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,880
wrong none of them is wrong it's all

542
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:45,480
about what you feel like you need to do

543
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,799
so I know people that you know they

544
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,000
defoliate the whole time they're growing

545
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:51,359
they they go in there every couple days

546
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and take stuff off I've heard that

547
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,918
stressful to the plant but these people

548
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,720
grow also very nice plants so who am I

549
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,200
to tell them what they're doing is wrong

550
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,798
I just know what works for for me and I

551
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,240
know that it works for me so I know it

552
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,759
will work for other people so that's why

553
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm kind of you know give my opinion and

554
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:09,679
I follow a lot of you uh a lot man

555
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,919
actually uh it's crazy that I'm sitting

556
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,240
here having this conversation with you

557
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:14,080
right now

558
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,200
actually yeah there are so many

559
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,720
different ways to grow I say it in so

560
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,400
many of my videos and often times you're

561
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,120
right it's not this way's right and this

562
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,640
way's wrong it's here's one way to do it

563
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:26,719
and there's another way to do it and

564
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,000
there's another way to do it and another

565
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,960
way to do it another you can do it so

566
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,880
different ways and you can still get an

567
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,400
end product so kind of Shifting

568
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,159
backwards I want to get back into

569
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,600
talking about some of the additives you

570
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,480
use you talked about using stash blend

571
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:42,519
first question for you is do you use it

572
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,839
at the application rate which is half

573
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:47,960
teaspoon per gallon of water and do you

574
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:51,079
use it as a sole drench only or or what

575
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,919
yeah so um I kind of watched the video

576
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:56,038
where you guys tried it as a top dress

577
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,038
method and that kind of scared me away

578
00:21:56,038 --> 00:22:01,278
from it uh but I will say man

579
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,240
uh I do it about I don't do a half a

580
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,798
tablespoon I do a whole tablespoon uh

581
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,278
per gallon of water I mix up a two

582
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:09,599
gallon bucket um at I mix two gallons at

583
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:13,519
a time because like I said I got small

584
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:16,519
small grows uh and then I give the same

585
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:18,000
uh you know uh R rated to amount I'm

586
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:20,400
sorry I give the same amount to my

587
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,558
plants outside as well uh and stash

588
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,640
blend and um recharge are literally the

589
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:28,119
only two amendments that I use um and

590
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,799
and I still feel that you know it's all

591
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:34,278
organic so I feel like that I'm still

592
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:35,918
staying in the Organics only lane um and

593
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:37,880
the plus side I think the reason why I

594
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,320
like the stash blend so much is because

595
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,679
man who doesn't like to smell Top Ramen

596
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:46,639
once a week you know what I mean it's

597
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,038
awesome but no um it the plants love it

598
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,520
man they really really love it um and I

599
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,158
don't feel like you can give them too

600
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:53,759
much because there there was one time

601
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,640
that I I accidentally gave a tablespoon

602
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,278
instead of a teaspoon to a gallon uh and

603
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,559
the plants didn't seem to be harmed by

604
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:01,079
it whatsoever uh that that goes back to

605
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:04,038
the plants are only going to take up

606
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:06,199
what they need so people that kills me

607
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:09,038
man I I don't understand why we got to

608
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,038
do the more is more no less is more in

609
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:13,440
in a lot of situations when it comes to

610
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:14,879
you know adding anything um you know

611
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,759
your amendments you can't overdo it on

612
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,320
the guy green I have done it um you can

613
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:20,960
you can kill your plant or burn your

614
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:22,720
plants that way don't necessarily kill

615
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,038
them it's just a tough go for a couple

616
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,038
weeks um but yeah the the the stash BL

617
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:32,640
is amazing you guys did amazing job

618
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:34,158
creating that uh you really did um and I

619
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,600
I like it so much that I that I have

620
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,880
some and I just give it away I just give

621
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,719
it to folks like d to try

622
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,000
this um and I've actually got a

623
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,919
experiment going right now where I have

624
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,960
just my Prix uh HP um and I got a plan

625
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:50,880
in there and I'm only giving it staty I

626
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,278
had put no amendments inside the the the

627
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,760
soil at all um and then it's growing

628
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:58,119
well I'll give it stash blend once a

629
00:23:54,759 --> 00:24:00,000
week uh with of course water every

630
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:01,639
couple days days cuz it needs it but uh

631
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,119
every few waterings I throw stash blend

632
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,200
in there and it seems to be loving life

633
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,879
right now um so I'm I'm trying to grow a

634
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,720
whole plant without using anything but

635
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,039
soil and stash blend that'd be pretty

636
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,839
wild yeah I don't think anybody's done

637
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:16,558
that yet it's really an additive it's a

638
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:19,038
215 NPK but it does have uh some other

639
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:21,240
nutrition in there such as silica for

640
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,558
example and then beneficials so I

641
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,319
imagine that the beneficials of micro

642
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:27,119
isal fungi and then the beneficial

643
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:28,960
bacterias helping with the breakdown of

644
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,359
amendments free use so I'm really glad

645
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,240
that you're having good success with it

646
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:36,599
and thatth for those that didn't catch

647
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,558
that Top Ramen joke it's because stash

648
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:41,918
Bland a lot of people say it smells like

649
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,759
beef Ramen dude it doesn't smell I feel

650
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,919
like you guys just took the packets and

651
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,798
put it in these bags it's identical like

652
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,600
I and I grew up you know very poor so i

653
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:52,398
e a lot of Top Ramen so I'm the one that

654
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:53,359
can really say hey this smells like

655
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:56,239
Ramen

656
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:58,918
noodles that's funny and so you use

657
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,599
stash blend and you use recharge and I

658
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,640
think this is an interesting topic as

659
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:04,158
well because there's a lot of folks that

660
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,679
think you need to use one or the other

661
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,600
and that's just not the case there's so

662
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,360
many people out there they're using both

663
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:10,879
stash blend and recharge and sure

664
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,398
there's some overlapping right the

665
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,799
seaweed overlaps some of the beneficials

666
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:17,319
overlap so on and so forth but you can

667
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:19,319
totally use them at the same time now

668
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:22,879
what are you using for an application

669
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:25,960
rate for the recharge and then how often

670
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,559
uh so uh actually I didn't I wasn't on

671
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:31,558
the recharge game at all um until I saw

672
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:32,918
Rob y y'all had a podcast with some I

673
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:35,519
can't remember who it was but he was

674
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:37,840
talking about how he uses recharge and

675
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,639
um he throws he said he throws stops

676
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:41,678
throwing stash blend in about the last

677
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,360
two weeks of flour and he starts using

678
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:47,278
recharge um and I tried that man and it

679
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:48,879
is it it really changed the way things

680
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:52,519
are

681
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,679
and it is to me it seems the same when

682
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:55,398
you're mixing it together I'm not going

683
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,919
to lie cuz you know it's easy you take

684
00:25:55,398 --> 00:25:58,798
it out of the bag you put it in water

685
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:01,759
you mix it up and it turns black

686
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,119
uh but the smells are I totally

687
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:04,759
different you know the recharge smells

688
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,359
like just molasses and then of course we

689
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:10,558
talked about the smell of the stash

690
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:12,439
blend um and then also the uh the

691
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,038
amounts you use so recharge is a much

692
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,720
smaller amount you know per your

693
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:18,839
application method versus the stash

694
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,278
blend um and a little goes a long way

695
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:24,038
with both of them so I I use it only

696
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:25,240
solely drenched method uh because I

697
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:26,879
don't feel confident enough to just

698
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,798
throw stuff in the soil and add water to

699
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,440
it um I don't want it to dry anything

700
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,960
out I feel like there's drying agents in

701
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,480
there um it's a powder uh and I feel

702
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,960
like it needs to be mixed properly with

703
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,839
water and then added to to combat those

704
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,600
drying agents um I don't know how true

705
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,439
that is this just how I feel personally

706
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,519
in my opinion so that's what the

707
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,720
formulation chemist said is it's

708
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:50,240
generally not recommended to use as just

709
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,440
a top dressing or I've done it but

710
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,960
sprinkling it on top of when you're

711
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,120
doing transplanting a lot of us know

712
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,919
that micro isal fungi is very beneficial

713
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:01,119
sprinkling directly on the roots and

714
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:03,399
that's stash plan so I tried it and it

715
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,278
seemed to be good uh you know just by

716
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:06,719
looking at the plant it didn't look like

717
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:08,720
there was any stunned or anything like

718
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,759
that so I mean I'm able to kind of use

719
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,399
it but yeah the formulation chemist had

720
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:14,278
mentioned that the concern about it

721
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:15,239
potentially drying out the roots for

722
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:16,839
example if you were to sprinkle it

723
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,079
directly on the roots but it's not

724
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:20,519
killing off the plant I can tell you

725
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:22,439
that one well I'll uh I'll have to try

726
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:24,038
it then I'll see what I can do with it

727
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,080
um what about recharge you've done any

728
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:28,599
of that with recharge

729
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:30,240
drive not that I can remember no I

730
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:32,319
usually just do the mix it up on water

731
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,079
and soil drench with the recharge so

732
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:37,038
shifting over to watering first of all

733
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:39,000
what is your water source so you tap

734
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:41,359
water reverse osmosis or some sort of

735
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,640
filtered water and how do you go about

736
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:48,359
waterings so um tap water uh straight

737
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:51,399
from the the water spet outside so I

738
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:54,079
have I I grow in my garage and I have a

739
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:55,639
water spet inside my garage uh so

740
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:58,558
essentially I just take and run water

741
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,919
from the water hose and uh fill up the

742
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,879
bucket um and I don't add anything to

743
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:04,320
the water at that point uh because

744
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,320
there's there's certain plants that I

745
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:09,319
don't give any kind of uh amendments to

746
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:11,798
uh as they get with just water uh such

747
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:16,960
as my cactuses so I'll take and fill up

748
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:19,519
my bucket um and I'll I got a a certain

749
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,480
certain jugs that I use for my medical

750
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,399
plants and then uh when I fill up those

751
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,038
I'll add you know my stash blend if I'm

752
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:29,119
going to or I'll add my uh recharge if

753
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,240
I'm going to but generally speaking I

754
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:33,319
try to water when the plant tells me it

755
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:37,038
needs water I don't do this whole 2 days

756
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:40,720
or 3 days or one day off or whatever uh

757
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:42,480
dryb backs are a huge huge huge deal uh

758
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,120
when you're when you're growing plants

759
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,240
um cuz dryb backs it gives it that

760
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:52,199
little bit of stress that it needs to

761
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:54,159
produce more um and and so I I I I I

762
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,440
deally I try to like pick up the pot and

763
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,159
if I can pick it up and it's pretty

764
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,080
light uh then I'll then I'll give it

765
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:00,559
water also I do the finger method so

766
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:02,678
I'll put my finger about halfway into

767
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,558
the soil uh if I don't feel anything

768
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:05,840
then I'll Water it then back in the day

769
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:07,240
when I first started doing this man I

770
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,439
thought the plants want to water all the

771
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,000
time and that is not the case that is

772
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,880
absolutely not the

773
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,038
case yeah I feel like we've all

774
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,278
struggled with overwatering every now

775
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:19,839
and then uh you know when we started and

776
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:22,119
even to this day I jeez it was just a

777
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:23,558
couple runs ago where I overwatered solo

778
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:25,119
plants and Solo cups and I'm like what

779
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:26,960
the heck cuz you know it can still be

780
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,278
tricky I get what you mean by that but

781
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,278
I'm a little bit jealous of you that

782
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:33,599
you're able to use your tap water my tap

783
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:35,839
water comes out at 485 PPM which is very

784
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,599
high and I know there's I think it's 80

785
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:40,599
parts per million sodium alone which is

786
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:42,519
not good for uh the plants that we're

787
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:43,879
trying to grow um but yeah I wish I

788
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:45,839
could use my tap water I have to use

789
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,799
reverse osmosis do you happen to know

790
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,319
what your PPM is out of the tap I don't

791
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:51,839
but I'm actually looking that up right

792
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:55,200
now because I'm kind of curious that you

793
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:58,798
said that I've never I just checked the

794
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,640
uh um I just checked the EC

795
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:03,398
uh of the water whenever I add the stuff

796
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,840
to it and I also check the pH sometimes

797
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:08,759
pH is not a big deal um what was your EC

798
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,038
on it

799
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:17,278
uh right around

800
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:19,519
1.8 okay so it's it's not awful um but

801
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,720
that's 900 PPM on a 500 scale that's

802
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:25,919
very heavy no no I'm sorry I'm talking

803
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,440
after add my stuff to it okay you said

804
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,600
I'm sorry man I thought you me out the

805
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,320
tap no the tap is very very little um

806
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:35,558
204 PPM is the what's registered around

807
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:37,200
my area nice okay so that's not that's

808
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:39,480
not bad I hear a lot of people having

809
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,519
that and it's less than half of what I

810
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,720
I'm dealing with so right and and then

811
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:47,960
the the uh ironically enough the the uh

812
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,558
pH straight out of the tap is 6.4 so

813
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,558
it's not I can't ask for anything better

814
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:53,158
really as far as the pH goes so I don't

815
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:55,319
know that if the plants really do what

816
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:56,919
they what the Organics people say they

817
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:58,480
do like you don't have to worry about it

818
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,960
or if the water is just that good when

819
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,360
it comes out cuz I mean that's a very

820
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,840
low PH um it's very very ideal actually

821
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:06,519
yeah a lot of the times that's the case

822
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:08,678
where people say oh I don't worry about

823
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:11,919
pH I'm growing Organics well their

824
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:15,480
initial water source is might be between

825
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,840
5.5 and 7.5 and then things just kind of

826
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,159
correct itself the plant releases acids

827
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:22,038
hydroxide ions that are floating around

828
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,480
they're being created yeah so things

829
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:25,798
kind of adjust in the medium as well so

830
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,399
I think that's the reason why a lot of

831
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:29,278
people say that they don't check pH or

832
00:31:27,398 --> 00:31:31,719
adjust pH is because their water source

833
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:33,319
is fine to begin yeah some of us have

834
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,839
good water sources and some of us comes

835
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:38,079
from Chernobyl like yours it sounds

836
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:41,158
like I know some folks who struggle with

837
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:43,119
like 8 8.5 pH out the tap and they're

838
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:44,720
like I have to adjust it they say that

839
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:46,479
they have to because they come across

840
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,480
problems if they're just trying to water

841
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,480
that in at that high pH they see

842
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,798
physical problems they see physical

843
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:57,360
deficiencies and they get lockout issues

844
00:31:53,798 --> 00:31:59,038
so they safeid it and knock it down even

845
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:00,558
though some of the scientists and some

846
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:02,278
of these experts are saying you don't

847
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,119
need to pH adjust at all no matter what

848
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:05,798
your water source comes out at some

849
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:09,759
people just try play a safe card on that

850
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:12,519
Avenue okay so that's pH uh EC as well

851
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:13,638
let's get into environment next one

852
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:15,319
thing we didn't really talk about is

853
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:16,798
lighting what type of light do you use

854
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:20,158
and how much power are you giving your

855
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:23,879
plants okay so uh as you see by my GTO I

856
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:26,480
a huge AC Infinity uh person I buy

857
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,440
everything that I have is AC Infinity uh

858
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,759
so not just because of of your guys just

859
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,200
because how they are with the community

860
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:34,720
I like to show them the support and the

861
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,440
stuff they have is absolutely phenomenal

862
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:41,000
man uh so in my little tents I have the

863
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:44,600
uh s22 uh little onon board s22 um

864
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:49,919
that's a 115 Watts I believe uh and it's

865
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:52,558
putting out about 900 uh ppf then that's

866
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,278
in my small I have two of those and I

867
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:58,558
have a uh in my 3x3 I have a EVO 4 uh

868
00:32:56,278 --> 00:33:01,159
and that that's the big guy it it's uh

869
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:04,918
it's a 300 watt light I believe and it's

870
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:08,360
putting out about 2,000 ppf maybe maybe

871
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:10,240
1,00 I think uh and that's 3.14 micros

872
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:12,439
per jeel in that that light and it's I

873
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,480
love it um and I've never Rent It full

874
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:18,159
full blast yet um I run it setting like

875
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,278
Max 8 I think um and it does what it

876
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,399
needs to do uh I don't actually measure

877
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:23,480
the part itself I just know the the

878
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:25,759
light

879
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,079
specifications um I'm not really that

880
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:30,638
far into it at this point now I probably

881
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,558
will get there but uh not really that

882
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:34,519
far into the lighting I just know that

883
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:38,359
uh where I had what I had

884
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:41,079
in five six years ago was a blue purple

885
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:43,158
king led it cost me like $400 almost

886
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:47,079
$500 for that thing and I wouldn't pay

887
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:49,720
$20 for it today so um it's just you

888
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:52,720
know you learn as you go uh and I I just

889
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:55,159
haven't delved into the the uh science

890
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,839
behind the lighting yet I want to but

891
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,080
I've got so much other things going on I

892
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:59,558
don't I don't really have the time to to

893
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,398
devote to it it's a lot of knowledge a

894
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:03,359
lot of scientific knowledge behind it so

895
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:05,158
there's definitely a lot to lighting I

896
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,798
spent a year and a half really diving

897
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:11,240
deep into lighting and uh doing a bunch

898
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:13,280
of part tests on I think 50 60 different

899
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:15,759
fixtures alone and now I've taken a

900
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,480
really really take a step back from

901
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,079
researching about lighting because

902
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,838
lighting we've gotten to a point where a

903
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,320
lot of these fixtures are going to give

904
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:26,639
enough for plant growth they're going to

905
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,800
be beyond what you need for good plant

906
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,878
growth I mean you mentioned that you're

907
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,320
not even running the lights at 100% a

908
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:34,719
lot of people aren't even running their

909
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:38,320
lights at 100% they have a dim down 80%

910
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:40,279
70% 60% throughout flowering these

911
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,760
lights are powerful enough that you can

912
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,359
dim them down considerably and they will

913
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,879
grow the plants very very well and it's

914
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:48,480
also going to allow your fixture to have

915
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:50,559
a longer lifespan if you're running it

916
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,000
at a lower lower percentage there so I

917
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:54,239
do the same exact thing and I also have

918
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,280
AC Infinity lightings as well so I've

919
00:34:54,239 --> 00:35:01,239
got the t22

920
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:02,599
t24 Evo 3's evo6 and uh yeah I love it

921
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:04,838
awesome now how about temperature

922
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:06,400
relative humidity CO2 some of those are

923
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:07,920
some of the things we can get into maybe

924
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,960
we'll start with temperature what do you

925
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,280
typically aim for lights on and lights

926
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,480
off okay so lights on um I'm running

927
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,519
about 80

928
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,800
81 um and then lights off I keep my well

929
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:24,039
I have it out in my garage uh and I just

930
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:27,400
installed HVAC to my garage uh so it's

931
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:28,800
about the same uh 80 81 lot on during

932
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,039
the day and then at night time that's

933
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,280
when I cut the lights off or have the

934
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:37,279
lights go off it's about 70 70ish 72 uh

935
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,800
so it's about 10 degrees swing there

936
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,880
okay and the relative humidity are you

937
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,800
changing it for the different stages of

938
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,960
growth or how do you go about RH here in

939
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,680
Alabama uh you know are we are very

940
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:52,000
humid so I have to keep a

941
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:54,399
dehumidifier uh and um I run it depends

942
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,079
so Daren seedings I I I don't have the

943
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,880
hum def on it's running about 75 8 %

944
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,640
humidity uh during the seeding stage uh

945
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,720
and then I cut it on and and the whole

946
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,239
grow I cut it down to about 55 I know

947
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,078
that during flower you want to go down a

948
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:10,279
little lower but I just keep it at 55

949
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,200
cuz to me it's just it's just easier

950
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,880
pretty ster fold there and then are you

951
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:18,358
supplementing CO2 at all or or no no you

952
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:21,838
uh I've I've watched a bunch of studies

953
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:24,358
and I I wanted to uh but uh when I got

954
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:26,279
to got got to looking on YouTube and how

955
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:29,119
it works and all this and watching mic

956
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,440
420 things and and Dakota uh you know

957
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,880
they're really big into trying out the

958
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,559
CO2 but Dakota made a statement that you

959
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,318
know your your breath is just is

960
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:39,759
equivalent you know uh as to having CO2

961
00:36:38,318 --> 00:36:40,920
in your house so and I hang out in my

962
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,240
garage all the time that's where I smoke

963
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:46,159
at so I'm always exhaling CO2 and I

964
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,439
never I never check it I don't even

965
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,078
think I'm missing anything by not using

966
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,280
it if that makes sense I really don't

967
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,440
feel I am I don't run really really high

968
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,680
temperature so it would not be you know

969
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,240
effective for for what I do yeah if

970
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:00,399
you're living in the same space that

971
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,639
you're growing for example same home

972
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,200
that you're growing in just what you

973
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:09,078
exhale can be sufficient I have a CO2

974
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:10,679
monitor I've had one for several years

975
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:13,599
and really kind of looking at it

976
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:17,719
sporadically it would show always be

977
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:21,280
elevated 600 plus you know 600 700 800

978
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:23,639
PPM now I have the AC Infiniti CO2

979
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,519
Monitor and I'm able to check it from my

980
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:28,318
app as well as it's on the controller as

981
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:30,639
well for the the AI Plus controller and

982
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:33,838
uh it's I read it yesterday it was 875

983
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:35,679
PPM I'm not supplementing CO2 anymore so

984
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:38,559
yeah as a hom grower small hom grower

985
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:41,799
myself I have tried the canisters I've

986
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:43,159
tried the CO2 mushroom bags and I don't

987
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,119
I feel like I don't need to do any of

988
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:48,519
that stuff anymore because my plants

989
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:51,000
seem to be growing fine and my CO2 PPM

990
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:53,400
levels are elevated I've seen I've seen

991
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,719
the videos of the uh CNB bags or

992
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,200
whatever they are um and the little

993
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:58,919
canisters too I'll see you I've seen you

994
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,000
with that and you said in the video that

995
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,920
you didn't really notice the difference

996
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,639
uh so I use those you know it's not

997
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,200
you're not a scientist you know what I

998
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:10,838
mean but you you do it you you you put

999
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:12,639
yourself in the situation and and you

1000
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:14,199
experiment and you record it and you put

1001
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:16,118
it on the internet for everybody else to

1002
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:18,279
see and people like me we actually watch

1003
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:20,680
it and listen and and you know I've I've

1004
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,960
never found like I know that the LED

1005
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:23,879
light I was using that was purple was

1006
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,880
not good you know just by watching the

1007
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:29,119
videos as as it progressed and so on and

1008
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,559
so forth uh so just by that alone you

1009
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,519
know I have I have enough common sense

1010
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:34,078
to know hey you know he tried this he is

1011
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:36,039
a person like me he's not trying to sell

1012
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,440
me on anything he said this doesn't work

1013
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:39,880
that well and I don't see a reason for

1014
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,519
me to try it U so I really appreciate

1015
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,960
you know the videos that you do put out

1016
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:44,000
and I appreciate your book by the way I

1017
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,318
I feel the mentioned that I've

1018
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,559
downloaded your book on Amazon so good

1019
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:50,400
job thanks glad you like it yeah as for

1020
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,000
the CO2 I definitely try to be

1021
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,760
transparent about it and I'm not trying

1022
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,239
to knock CO2 at all or people that you

1023
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,720
supplement CO2 because there are studies

1024
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:02,039
out out there that show a 30% increase

1025
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:04,838
in yield if you're having running 1400

1026
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:07,079
PPM throughout the flowering stage and

1027
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:09,639
uh you sir you can definitely get more

1028
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:11,440
yield if you supplement CO2 but it's not

1029
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:14,239
for everybody in the sense where if

1030
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,559
you're not really looking for maximize

1031
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:18,239
your yield if you're just growing your

1032
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:20,838
own Supply it's super easy to grow your

1033
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:22,199
own and get your Harvest without

1034
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:24,880
supplementing CO2 without that

1035
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:27,719
additional added expense whether it be

1036
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,800
using the tanks or the canisters or the

1037
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:32,480
mushroom bags you're paying money in

1038
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,240
order to get that right so if you're

1039
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,199
able to not spend that money and you're

1040
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:40,000
able to still get the supply to support

1041
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:42,159
yourself then uh why not right so that's

1042
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
kind of my Approach on it and I do get

1043
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:46,838
the idea behind it um uh I really do you

1044
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,199
know uh especially the mushroom bags

1045
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:52,880
themselves um they uh they do excrete a

1046
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:55,519
lot of CO2 but just like you're saying

1047
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,559
so do you when you breathe um that's why

1048
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:00,318
the whole Mass thing just puzzled me but

1049
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:02,440
you know you uh you breathe out CO2 and

1050
00:40:00,318 --> 00:40:04,279
your plants do use it so like people

1051
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,960
that sing to their plants are real real

1052
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,040
big Believers in that they said that is

1053
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,920
the music um and also the the the breath

1054
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,239
that you breathe you know you're

1055
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,318
breathing out CO2 your plants are

1056
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:15,239
breathing that in because they breathe

1057
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:16,838
underneath the leaves um so you're

1058
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:18,959
you're right there at them giving them

1059
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:21,119
CO2 and and I'm sure they take it in you

1060
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,760
know and I'm sure that uh the SC like

1061
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,519
the scientific study shows but I just

1062
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,520
don't have the capacity for that you

1063
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:29,000
know what I mean makes sense okay I want

1064
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:31,079
to switch it up in and talk about pests

1065
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,318
for a little bit uh this is something

1066
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:36,519
that uh I don't talk about as much in

1067
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:38,279
these episodes as as we should because a

1068
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:40,639
lot of people come across pests what do

1069
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,599
you do in order to prevent pests from

1070
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:47,358
invading a grow space uh believe it or

1071
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:50,000
not man oils uh peppermint oil lavender

1072
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:52,400
um and and I don't I don't believe in

1073
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,039
using like uh pesticides even in my

1074
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,280
house I don't like that stuff I have

1075
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:57,719
kids I have animals um and it it's

1076
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,359
dangerous so why would I want to put

1077
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:02,039
something in there that I have to smoke

1078
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:04,598
so I'll prevent it you know uh and the

1079
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:07,559
the the the the

1080
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:09,519
Citrus the Citrus Central essential oils

1081
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:12,078
and the peppera and and the lavender all

1082
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:15,838
that really does help and what I do is

1083
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,039
uh I get the um I forgot I forgot what

1084
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:18,838
they're called but you can get them on

1085
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:20,759
Amazon and it's essential oil like air

1086
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:22,279
fresheners and what I do is I put little

1087
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,480
ones on the inside of my tent so you

1088
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,200
know you know how your tent has that

1089
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,838
that tray liner in the bottom that goes

1090
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:29,719
inside of there uh well there's a bunch

1091
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:32,279
of space in between the actual tent and

1092
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:34,559
that tray liner so I stick those those

1093
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,560
little things in there and you know on

1094
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,440
the plus side my room when I open my

1095
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:40,039
tent when I open up smells good uh

1096
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,318
smells like peppermint and there's never

1097
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:44,880
I've never had any issues with pest uh

1098
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:47,679
ever like I'm I'm knock on wood but I

1099
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,318
really never have so uh I'm hoping that

1100
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:50,440
that's that's doing the trick or or

1101
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:52,800
maybe they just don't like the bugs

1102
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,358
don't like us here I don't know that's

1103
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,880
awesome I'm glad that that's working out

1104
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:57,759
for you and you haven't come across any

1105
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,200
pasts I mean that's uh not a lot of

1106
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,599
grows can say that that's for sure now

1107
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:02,919
watch my next couple grows will be

1108
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,119
infested with

1109
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:08,760
spider you jinx yourself yeah so for

1110
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:10,200
this method that you use to grow right

1111
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,760
you're talking about the Amendments that

1112
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:15,519
you top dress in and water in a lot of

1113
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,960
people do this route and try to keep

1114
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:20,440
everything organic however challenges

1115
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,039
can occur doing it this way what would

1116
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:25,920
you say some of the common challenges

1117
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:28,838
are of doing this method uh a huge one

1118
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,880
is forgetting to top dresser plants uh

1119
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:33,239
you you could literally go like where

1120
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,760
it's supposed to be two feedings not top

1121
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:39,159
dresser plants and and the downside okay

1122
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,599
so there's always a plus and uh a a pro

1123
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:43,399
sorry a pro and a con to every situation

1124
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,680
uh and growing is no different so on the

1125
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,440
organic side um you know when you add

1126
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:49,199
your amendments they're not available

1127
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,800
right away it takes two weeks for them

1128
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:53,598
to start breaking down for your plant to

1129
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,240
start using them uh as opposed to you

1130
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,318
know synthetic nutrients salt-based

1131
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:59,239
nutrients you can put it in the plant

1132
00:42:57,318 --> 00:43:01,558
the next day you wake up the plant looks

1133
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:03,479
totally different uh because it absorbed

1134
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:06,240
the nutrients already but yeah Organics

1135
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,838
man forgetting to feed them um that's

1136
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:09,039
that's huge so now I actually don't have

1137
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:11,759
to worry about that anymore I have an

1138
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:13,800
alarm set in my phone uh that way I know

1139
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,920
hey today I got to feed these Jokers uh

1140
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,680
because if you don't so if you if you

1141
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,358
miss a feeding that's four weeks uh and

1142
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:22,960
then you add it say you remember four

1143
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:24,519
weeks you know after you forgot about it

1144
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,720
so it's your time for your second feed

1145
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:27,280
you're like oh crap I didn't feed on the

1146
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:29,519
last time well then it's going to be

1147
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,480
another 2 weeks before there's any

1148
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:34,039
availability of your uh your your

1149
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,440
nutrients for your plant to be used so

1150
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:39,318
that's 6 weeks of your plants just

1151
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:42,240
lacking on food uh now they do have

1152
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:44,679
their own like um their own method of of

1153
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:46,759
saving themselves uh they use what they

1154
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:48,799
have uh and they let you know that they

1155
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,000
need to be fed and unfortunately if

1156
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,559
you're doing just synthetic I mean just

1157
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,280
or organic you can't just fix the

1158
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:57,079
problem right away uh and that's where I

1159
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,760
feel like s sanics come in I feel like

1160
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:00,920
you know it's kind of like The Best of

1161
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,599
Both Worlds I do have all the stuff I

1162
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,559
need to do that I just haven't done it

1163
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:06,599
yet I I really can't commit to a feed

1164
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:09,599
schedule right now I got too much going

1165
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:11,680
on so working ahead is so key like you

1166
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,240
said if you miss a feeding or even if

1167
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:16,440
you're late like I've had plants where I

1168
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:18,519
was uh just a few days late and then you

1169
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,200
start to see the plant yellowing a

1170
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:21,920
little bit you're like oh great now if I

1171
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:23,279
top dress it's going to take a little

1172
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,599
while for the amendments to break down

1173
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,800
like you mentioned and you kind of get

1174
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,559
into hot water I think that's where a

1175
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,880
lot of people get frustrated is they uh

1176
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:32,280
they miss a feeding or they're seeing

1177
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,640
the plants yellowing and they're like oh

1178
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,760
no I need to top dress and then they top

1179
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:39,039
dress and nothing really happens for at

1180
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,839
least a week if not two weeks those

1181
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,239
amendments haven't broken down yet so

1182
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:44,480
the plant just gets worse and worse and

1183
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:46,358
worse well that's where you can add in

1184
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,480
either your synthetic nutrients and go

1185
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:50,960
Sanic or a lot of people do teas right

1186
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,960
compost teas that's something we didn't

1187
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,599
get into do you do compost teas at all

1188
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,639
or no I I have in the past uh they're

1189
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,359
just they're very messy

1190
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:03,000
and uh I haven't I haven't done any

1191
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:05,000
anything uh with compost in about 2

1192
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
years I do have compost like I I

1193
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,480
actually do have a compost pile uh and

1194
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,239
I'm going to try to figure out a way to

1195
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,079
incorporate that into to one of my girls

1196
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:15,879
and then you know I documented and share

1197
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:19,240
it but um as far as actually using

1198
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:21,079
compost no I have uh I have not done too

1199
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:24,039
much of that like I said two years ago I

1200
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:26,720
did a tea uh it smelled awful the my

1201
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:29,199
wife absolutely hated it uh and it was

1202
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:31,159
just messy so I didn't I haven't messed

1203
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:34,318
with it since then got it yeah well

1204
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:36,000
compos sees can be beneficial to uh help

1205
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:38,800
increase that micro population for

1206
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,119
example and and some of the um some of

1207
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,960
the nutrients in there are water soluble

1208
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,599
depending on the compost of course but

1209
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,519
instead of using compost some people use

1210
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:48,519
the worm castings so that's another

1211
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:50,679
great way to actually get those

1212
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:52,159
beneficials in there and help break down

1213
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:54,159
some of those amendments that need to be

1214
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:56,480
broken down so and that's something I

1215
00:45:54,159 --> 00:46:00,639
failed to mention as well Chris um when

1216
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,159
I was making my soil uh I actually 100%

1217
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:04,719
I left a bag of worm casting in the

1218
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,558
trunk of my car and I made the soil you

1219
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:08,199
know and I put all the I did all the

1220
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:10,200
stuff that I like I was getting ready to

1221
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:13,598
grow and and you know I planted my

1222
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:15,279
plants uh and I went a whole entire run

1223
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,599
with no worm castings and it was no

1224
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,920
issues there was Zero issues uh and I

1225
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:24,599
was quite surprised by that actually um

1226
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,880
I mean no issues so it's all about I

1227
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:27,838
guess how you take care of things I

1228
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,599
don't know I I I think I think that the

1229
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:31,440
the the stash Bland kind of took place

1230
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:35,240
of what I would have needed the worm

1231
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:38,000
casts for um and also um the the guy

1232
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:41,679
green does a very good job um you know

1233
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,920
at being organic nutrients so uh you

1234
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:47,159
can't it it it couldn't hurt me but I

1235
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,599
don't think that uh me not having it in

1236
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:52,480
there hurt hurt any of my Harvest or

1237
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:55,318
hurt my run at all um and you know since

1238
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,679
then I have been added worm cins to my

1239
00:46:55,318 --> 00:47:00,119
to my soil but I honestly I don't feel

1240
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,199
like that I needed that I need it um and

1241
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:04,640
then you know when I make my next recipe

1242
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:06,439
of soil I might go without adding it and

1243
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,199
then document it for real and and see

1244
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,838
what happens yeah see if you notice a

1245
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:12,480
difference that'd be interesting to see

1246
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:14,000
yep so this next question is one that I

1247
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,838
just started asking people a couple

1248
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,119
episodes ago I figured it was good to

1249
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:18,960
ask because a lot of viewers want to

1250
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,599
know talk to us about some of the top

1251
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,838
strains that you've grown maybe the top

1252
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:25,599
three strains that you've grown and what

1253
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:27,838
you like about them okay so uh it's

1254
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,880
pretty easy um

1255
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:32,880
my battle of the Breeders run uh the

1256
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,480
which is the last run that I harvested

1257
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,039
uh my Atlas seeds chew to the hut that

1258
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,960
was an very very very impressive uh

1259
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:43,199
Harvest uh like I said a oneg pot I had

1260
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,838
over 100 G dry weight uh so you know

1261
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:47,439
there was lar there was you know a whole

1262
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:51,920
bunch of trim and stuff that came off of

1263
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:55,480
that um very very large dense dense nugs

1264
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,318
very large um and my other my second

1265
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,880
favorite I guess would be my CED

1266
00:47:57,318 --> 00:48:02,599
critical mask by seedsman that the

1267
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:05,800
flavor it was wild I've never had a

1268
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:09,400
flavor of Smarties in a smoke but it it

1269
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:11,440
literally tastes and smelled like

1270
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,599
Smarties and it it it was crazy to me

1271
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,280
and wasn't a very very large Yer it was

1272
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:20,720
okay Yer uh but it wasn't very large and

1273
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:25,599
then uh my third favorite would be

1274
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:29,318
um uh new kids has a strain um it's

1275
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,400
called n it's like a crossback of I

1276
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:34,119
think Gren per with one of their their

1277
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:37,599
signature strains uh and that was a very

1278
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:41,880
large yelder as well um so those three

1279
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:43,480
uh seasman new kids and Atlas seeds I

1280
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,280
know you grow the Cal critical mass as

1281
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,960
well how did you how how do you feel

1282
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:51,640
about that one the Cali critical mass I

1283
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:54,000
had uh it was more beefy structure it

1284
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:55,639
tended to fox tail at least I I had two

1285
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,639
different plants one of them was a

1286
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:59,679
threein one it was three plants in one

1287
00:48:57,639 --> 00:49:01,719
container that one was it was

1288
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:04,078
overshadowed by the other two plants so

1289
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:05,598
it was only like 10 in long and then the

1290
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,039
other plant I had in its own container

1291
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:10,838
it was in a 10-gallon container organic

1292
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:13,199
living soil real big beefy buds Fox

1293
00:49:10,838 --> 00:49:14,759
tailed like crazy as far as like the

1294
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:17,159
taste and smell I wasn't too crazy about

1295
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:19,119
it I didn't get the smarties taste that

1296
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:21,279
you had mentioned any type of candy

1297
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:23,440
flavor it was more like a very earthy

1298
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,798
flavor I think they describe it on their

1299
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:29,960
website as like uh a wet Forest damp

1300
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:31,519
floor something like that really I guess

1301
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:34,199
I got an outl I should have Clon that

1302
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:35,480
joker then yeah right yeah it sounds

1303
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:37,078
like you got something completely

1304
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,719
different from what was advertised there

1305
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:40,559
so yeah it would been interesting if you

1306
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:42,879
kept that around and environment comes a

1307
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,119
lot into it right so maybe it was just a

1308
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,039
different environment compared to what

1309
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:47,240
I'm growing in and uh you get a

1310
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:50,279
different result right different

1311
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:53,719
phenotypic expression right I've

1312
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:56,960
actually grown um some gorilla cookies

1313
00:49:53,719 --> 00:49:58,879
by fast Buds and I grow two of them side

1314
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:03,400
by side I did the fast flow version and

1315
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:05,519
the auto flow um and I crazy identical

1316
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,720
as far as the the structure goes but the

1317
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:09,119
smell man it was one of them smell like

1318
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:11,318
gym socks and one of them smell like

1319
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:14,160
cookies so it was just it's weird

1320
00:50:11,318 --> 00:50:16,960
watching that uh being the same one uh

1321
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:19,039
being the same cult or the same uh

1322
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,519
parents but are two different I don't

1323
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:22,358
know how to explain it man you got one

1324
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:23,920
on it's the fast FL one is the auto flow

1325
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:25,400
I guess it comes back to how they were

1326
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,159
crossed when they were breed they must

1327
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:31,280
have they might have had a female um of

1328
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:32,879
one plant and a male of one plant and

1329
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,880
then for the for the auto flower it

1330
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,440
could have been the opposite you know

1331
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,720
what I mean um I'm not not really sure

1332
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,880
how I'm going to how I was trying to say

1333
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:42,519
that but I'm I'm sorry I'm I try to talk

1334
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:45,200
faster than what my brain lets

1335
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:46,759
