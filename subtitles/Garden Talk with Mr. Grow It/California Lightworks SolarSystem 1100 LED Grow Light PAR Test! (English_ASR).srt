00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,270
what is up everybody feel that don't

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,068
know me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,259
and today I've got a part test video for

4
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:09,809
you this is the California light works a

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,699
solar system 1100 LED grow light it has

6
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:14,279
a coverage area of a 4 foot by 4 foot

7
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:17,039
and the 10th I am taking measurements in

8
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,689
is a 4 foot by 4 foot this LED grow

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,820
light is compatible with the controller

10
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,350
I do not have the controller so the

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,539
measurements I take will just be from

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,670
plugging in the light without adjusting

13
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,640
the spectrum at all I actually ran this

14
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,868
grow light for a couple grows and those

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,189
girls are actually documented on my

16
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:35,189
youtube channel so I've had a couple

17
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,480
grow series using this light so if you

18
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:38,099
want to see how those plants turned out

19
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,189
feel free to look back at those videos

20
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,070
I'll take measurements at 18 inches 24

21
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:44,699
inches and then 36 inches I'm using the

22
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,640
apogee

23
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,980
MQ 500 quantum sensor this takes par

24
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,149
measurements in ppfd and I'm just gonna

25
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:52,229
be doing the measurements in the video

26
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,509
I'm not gonna be talking about it in the

27
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:56,250
features or anything like that so if you

28
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:57,628
want to learn more about this LED grill

29
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,590
light I will link it in the description

30
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:00,210
section below

31
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,980
alright let's get into the measurements

32
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,870
just like the other videos I won't talk

33
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,408
over it I'll just let the measurements

34
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:06,408
do the talking

35
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:53,878
