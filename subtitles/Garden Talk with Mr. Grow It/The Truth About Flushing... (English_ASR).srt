1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,080
they said within the study that not

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,798
using nutrients for the last 14 days

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,080
resulted in

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,960
no difference in yield potency terpenes

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,960
mineral content

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,080
what's up everybody if you that don't

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,600
know me my name is chris aka mr growit

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:20,879
and i'm back with another video if this

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,000
is your first time seeing my face i

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:22,879
would love to have you stick around and

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,960
subscribe

12
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,879
this is my garden talk channel to where

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,599
i mostly do discussion videos topic

14
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,358
videos

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,039
i also have some grow like test videos

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,239
on this channel as well and then have a

17
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,120
separate channel which is my main

18
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,799
youtube channel

19
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,558
where i show off my plants let's just

20
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,839
get right into today's video

21
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,079
this is probably going to be my most

22
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,079
disliked video the reason why is because

23
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,359
this topic is highly debatable we're

24
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,960
going to talk about flushing

25
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,878
and by the end of this video you should

26
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,878
know some of the truth behind whether or

27
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,119
not flushing is actually beneficial

28
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,718
now when i'm talking about flushing i'm

29
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,799
not talking about flushing

30
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,719
mid-grow sometimes you'll have to flush

31
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,799
mid-grow depending on if you're using

32
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,480
synthetic nutrients for example

33
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,839
maybe you have overfed your plants and

34
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,038
you need to flush out some of those

35
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,320
nutrients

36
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,159
maybe you have a salt buildup and you

37
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,478
need a flush maybe your ph

38
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,400
is off some people flush because of that

39
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,799
i'm not talking about flushing midgrow

40
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,478
i'm specifically talking about the flush

41
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,040
that happens at the end of the grow

42
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:16,239
cycle

43
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,159
so when your plants are almost ready for

44
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,798
harvest some growers will do

45
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,200
what's called a 14 day flush now not

46
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,799
everybody sticks to that 14 day flush

47
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,320
some people do 10 days 7 days five days

48
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,920
and then you got some people who don't

49
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,158
actually flush their plants at all

50
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,079
so there are various opinions and people

51
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,079
have their own reasons for why they like

52
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,478
to do a flush at the end of the grow

53
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,478
some things i've heard about is flushing

54
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,399
to reduce the amount of nutrients

55
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,679
that are in the soil and also in the

56
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,359
plant so that the

57
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,000
overall final product has a good taste

58
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,478
smell and the ash when smoking is more

59
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,799
white

60
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,840
instead of a gray or black some people

61
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,520
say that flushing

62
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,359
reduces the harshness in the final

63
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,798
product i've also heard that flushing

64
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:03,519
increases terpene content thc content

65
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,719
there's many many reasons why people

66
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,078
flush their plants

67
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,000
and up until now there hasn't really

68
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,919
been any scientific studies

69
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,598
on this process so in this video i'm

70
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,679
going to talk about a recent

71
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,639
scientific study that was done on the

72
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,159
flushing process

73
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,238
at the end of the grow and they got a

74
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,079
ton of data and

75
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,280
shows whether or not flushing is

76
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,360
beneficial or not

77
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,878
so let's talk about the study so first

78
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,840
off this study actually came out several

79
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,318
months ago

80
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,759
it's not brand new information some of

81
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:30,799
you watching this probably already came

82
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,878
across this study

83
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,719
but i know a lot of my audience is new

84
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,159
growers so i'm pretty sure

85
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,000
a lot of this information is going to be

86
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,919
new to a lot of my audience so this

87
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,159
particular study was done by rx

88
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,518
green technologies and i got some notes

89
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,479
over here so you see my eyes

90
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,000
shift over here i'm just referring to uh

91
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,560
the notes that i have according to the

92
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,159
study

93
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,719
i want to make sure that what i'm saying

94
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,318
here accurately reflects what is in the

95
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,959
study now i'm also going to have a link

96
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:56,958
down

97
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,719
in the description section below to a

98
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,640
web page which goes over

99
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,479
the study entirely so what exactly did

100
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,199
they do in this study so they use the

101
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,679
strain

102
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,878
cherry diesel for the study they use

103
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,719
their own nutrients

104
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,158
and the plants were grown in coca-cola

105
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,158
and they did four different flush

106
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,239
periods they did a 14-day flush

107
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,359
they did a 10-day flush a seven-day

108
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,599
flush and

109
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,920
zero-day flush and each flushing period

110
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,439
had 12 plants so they had 12 plants that

111
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,000
did a 14 day flush

112
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,680
12 plants that did a 10 day flush 12

113
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,439
plants they did a seven day flush

114
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,680
and then 12 plants that day didn't flush

115
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,519
at all flour and fan leaf samples were

116
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,439
collected from each flushing treatment

117
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,959
on the first day of flush and the day

118
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,479
before harvest to quantify

119
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,280
concentrations of essential plant

120
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,959
nutrients

121
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,959
after harvest the plants were cured

122
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,840
before determining final trimmed

123
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,878
flower weight terpenes and thc

124
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,319
concentration

125
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,560
they even took the trim from those

126
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,199
plants and evaluated that they evaluated

127
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,640
the trim

128
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,798
for thc yield and the appearance of the

129
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,158
extract to determine smoking flavor and

130
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,840
characteristics

131
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,519
samples of each flushing period were

132
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,840
distributed to industry

133
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,039
experts in a blind taste test i want to

134
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,878
know where i sign up for this blind

135
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,438
taste test because it sounds like a cool

136
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,438
job

137
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,199
each participant received one sample of

138
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:09,919
each flushing time without knowledge of

139
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,199
its treatment

140
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:12,878
participants were asked about their

141
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,280
personal flavor preferences before

142
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,599
tasting after tasting participants were

143
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,759
asked to rate the sample of the flour

144
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,759
harshness of smoke and the color of the

145
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,400
ash data collected during the course of

146
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,639
the trial

147
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,478
were analyzed statistically to determine

148
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,360
whether flushing times affected

149
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:31,039
smoking quality flower weight or the

150
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,800
chemical characteristics

151
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,800
so those are the materials and methods

152
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,000
used for this study now let's talk about

153
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,000
what their results were

154
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,600
so they mentioned in the study visual

155
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,279
differences in fan leaves between

156
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,400
flushing times were apparent the day

157
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,399
before harvest

158
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,839
plants flushed for 10 or 14 days had

159
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,399
leaves that were more yellow

160
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,918
necrotic and dry than plants flushed for

161
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,560
0 or 7 days

162
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,120
the color of the 14 and 10 day flushed

163
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,478
leaves

164
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,240
indicate a greater breakdown of

165
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,680
chlorophyll in the plant leading to

166
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,240
reduced greenness

167
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,840
that right there is key that's something

168
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,160
that i want to discuss

169
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,000
at the end of this this is something

170
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,600
that

171
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,360
well yeah i'll just save it to the end

172
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,280
as for yield thc

173
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,639
and terpenes overall there were no

174
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,319
significant differences between

175
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,960
treatments for flower weight

176
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,519
thc or terpene content here are the

177
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,680
charts

178
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,519
showing the average weight per plant

179
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,600
average thc percent

180
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,719
and the dominant terpenes they also took

181
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,720
flower samples

182
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,560
taken the day before harvest and

183
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,360
analyzed it for the content of essential

184
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,478
plant nutrients

185
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,759
that's one of the things i mentioned

186
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,279
during the introduction is a lot of

187
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,879
people say that

188
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,359
flushing your plant you flush out those

189
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,959
nutrients from the medium and the plant

190
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,720
and that's one of them that contributes

191
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,560
to a greater smoke

192
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,080
they state overall there was no

193
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,519
significant change in the mineral

194
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,959
content of flower

195
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,799
as a result of different flushing

196
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,839
treatments here are the charts which

197
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,160
show the nutrients

198
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,879
flower concentration percent for 14 day

199
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,759
flush

200
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,120
10 day flush seven day flush and plants

201
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,199
that weren't flush at all

202
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,038
extraction results trim from the cherry

203
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,439
diesel was sent to an extractor

204
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,959
to determine extraction yield and prefer

205
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,600
characteristics of the wax

206
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,719
plants flushed for 14 or 10 days had the

207
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,039
highest extraction

208
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,000
yield compared to the seven or zero day

209
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,000
flushes

210
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,199
however the appearance of the wax for

211
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,879
the zero day flush

212
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,120
was preferred over the other flush

213
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,000
periods the zero day flush was the

214
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,000
clearest

215
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,839
so what they concluded on this part is

216
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,519
although increased flush times resulted

217
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,799
in higher extraction yields

218
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,038
the finished product was not as

219
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,639
desirable for extraction now remember

220
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,519
this is a commercial facility

221
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,639
i myself i'm a home grower when it comes

222
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,120
to wax

223
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,720
the clarity of the product for me

224
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,759
personally

225
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,600
i'm not going to be upset if one thing

226
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,400
of wax is a little bit darker than the

227
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,280
other

228
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,079
but on a commercial side of things it is

229
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,918
something that

230
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,199
apparently they look very closely at

231
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,198
let's talk about the taste and

232
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,120
smoke characteristics of the flower so

233
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,759
the cured flower was evaluated by a

234
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,759
group of

235
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,759
industry experts it'd be interesting to

236
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,840
know who these industry experts actually

237
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,919
are they don't mention it in the study

238
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,758
unfortunately so they evaluated for

239
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,198
flavor and smoking characteristics in a

240
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,960
blind taste test

241
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,038
overall the duration of the flushing

242
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,839
period had no impact on flavor

243
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,519
smoothness of smoke or color of ash the

244
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,598
seven day flush period had the highest

245
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,120
bad rating and the zero day flush had

246
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:20,719
the highest grade rating

247
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,800
most panelists rated the flavor of the

248
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,880
samples as okay or good

249
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,800
the 10 day flush had the highest ok

250
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,360
readings and the zero day flush had the

251
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,520
highest

252
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,680
good ratings most panelists rated the

253
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,879
samples as either earthy or sweet

254
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,800
so it doesn't actually say how many

255
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,719
panelists there were

256
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,478
you know was there two people was there

257
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,680
four people was there ten people

258
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:41,598
definitely think that was some important

259
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,160
information that should have been said

260
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:44,240
here

261
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,479
taste test panelists rated the ash color

262
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,478
and smoke quality of each sample

263
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:51,038
ash color was predominantly black or

264
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,560
gray smoothness of smoke increased with

265
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,839
decreased flushing time

266
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,038
although it wasn't significantly

267
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,560
different i'm going to read their

268
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,159
overall conclusion

269
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,240
word by word i don't want to miss

270
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,039
anything on here in a first of its kind

271
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,038
study

272
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,959
arc screen technologies evaluated the

273
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:08,240
effects of a flushing period on

274
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,680
yield potency terpenes mineral content

275
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,840
and taste characteristics

276
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,720
of mj flower overall the length of the

277
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,000
flushing period

278
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,560
did not impact yield potency terpenes

279
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,639
or taste characteristics of mj flour

280
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,639
taste test results indicated a trend

281
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,639
towards improved flavor and smoke

282
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,918
quality with the zero day flush

283
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,759
while there were no significant

284
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,918
differences in nutrient content there

285
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,158
was a trend towards increased iron and

286
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,838
zinc and flour flushed for 14 days

287
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,240
the result of this trial indicates that

288
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,159
there is no benefit to flushing mj flour

289
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,560
for improved taste or consumer

290
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,759
experience okay so that is what they put

291
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,598
in their study

292
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,799
so what are my thoughts so the very end

293
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,120
of the study the last

294
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,479
sentence that they put here is the

295
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,919
results of this trial indicate that

296
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,759
there is no benefit

297
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,000
for improved taste or consumer

298
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:56,559
experience okay improved taste

299
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,720
consumer experience got it but if we're

300
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,559
talking about flushing as a whole

301
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,879
they did list off some benefits in their

302
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,958
study right they said within the study

303
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,080
that not using nutrients for the last 14

304
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,359
days resulted in

305
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,879
no difference in yield potency terpenes

306
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,278
mineral content and taste

307
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,559
characteristics then why use nutrients

308
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:15,600
for the past 14 days

309
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,199
if you're not feeding the plant for the

310
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,560
last 14 days well then you're saving

311
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,920
money on nutrients right

312
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,518
and you save time by not mixing

313
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:22,079
nutrients i know in a commercial

314
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,679
facility

315
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,519
they have different processes it's

316
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:28,799
probably well streamlined

317
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,600
here for me as a home grower mixing

318
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,879
nutrients

319
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,800
definitely takes a little bit of time

320
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,720
right there are some synthetic nutrient

321
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,599
lineups that have three bottles that you

322
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,240
mix in and some have up to 10 bottles

323
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,240
that you mix in so mixing all those

324
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,799
bottles within water and then giving to

325
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,879
the plant

326
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,559
is definitely time consuming and doing

327
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,080
that versus just watering

328
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,000
well you're so definitely saving time

329
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,920
with just watering and like they said

330
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,679
not feeding nutrients had no impact on

331
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,639
yield that's one of the arguments that i

332
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,399
hear pretty often

333
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:57,679
is if you're not feeding the plant all

334
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,039
the way up to the end

335
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,120
then those last couple weeks you're

336
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,078
potentially losing yield this study

337
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,679
proved otherwise

338
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:05,838
so that's one thing now let's talk about

339
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,278
the harshness i'd like to know what is

340
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,600
the humidity or

341
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,799
the moisture content within the buds you

342
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,159
know as homegrown is one thing that we

343
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,919
hear pretty often

344
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:18,078
is that if your hygrometer is around 62

345
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,958
within the jars then the buds are at the

346
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:20,559
ideal level

347
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,838
for consumption now on the commercial

348
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,119
side of things they don't measure that

349
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,880
way

350
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,240
from my understanding they use a

351
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:27,600
moisture meter and they actually stick

352
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,879
it within the bud to find out what the

353
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
moisture content is

354
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,078
within the bud i don't know too much

355
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,519
about the process so if anybody works in

356
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,078
a commercial facility and can explain

357
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,679
more

358
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:37,679
please let us know down in the comments

359
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,879
but yeah i mean the drier the sample the

360
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,519
more harsh it is going to be on the

361
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,240
throat

362
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,000
if it was around 62 percent rh you know

363
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,519
in the jar with the buds

364
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,600
that's going to be a lot less harsh than

365
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,320
something that's more dry 40

366
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,839
30 rh that's definitely a contributing

367
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,160
factor to harshness

368
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,839
on the throw when smoked so i'd like to

369
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:56,639
know what the samples what the moisture

370
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,800
content was

371
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,679
what the humidity was in the jars that

372
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,199
they were sampling

373
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,120
another thing is how long did they cure

374
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,200
the buds for before they consume them

375
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,039
on the homegrown side of things we dry

376
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,399
our plants then it goes into the curing

377
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,319
process

378
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,320
now oftentimes i hear that you want to

379
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,160
do at least two weeks in the curing

380
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,000
process before you smoke the buds

381
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,838
even at that point i feel like i can

382
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,839
still taste some of the chlorophyll

383
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,200
i personally wait until 30 days into

384
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,880
curing before i consume

385
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,320
and even at that point i can still taste

386
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,879
some of the chlorophyll according to

387
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,278
leafly

388
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,799
it takes six months to a year in order

389
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,120
for those buds to have the true

390
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,879
taste and smell so how long they cure

391
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,480
for is definitely a contributing factor

392
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:35,439
to harshness in my opinion

393
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,120
and one of the things that they

394
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,200
highlighted in the study which i said i

395
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,839
was going to refer back to at the end

396
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,680
was the color of the 14 and 10 day

397
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,600
flushed leaves indicate a greater

398
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,679
breakdown of chlorophyll on the plant

399
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,639
leading to reduced greenness so i'd like

400
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,439
to know

401
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,159
was it a faster cure for the plants that

402
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,120
were flushed

403
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:57,039
14 days 10 days versus the plants that

404
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,240
were had a zero day flush for example

405
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:59,199
that's really the main reason why i

406
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,959
flush my plants

407
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,200
if the chlorophyll breakdown process is

408
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,559
happening while the plant is still alive

409
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,160
and you harvest a plant where it's

410
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,039
mostly yellow leaves

411
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,799
that should be a faster cure than if you

412
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,399
harvest a plant with all green leaves

413
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,919
so that's one thing i really think that

414
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,278
if they included the chlorophyll

415
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,039
breakdown they had that

416
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,240
sort of measurement within the study

417
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,799
that kind of would have been the icing

418
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,320
on the cake

419
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,479
but they didn't measure the chlorophyll

420
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,240
amount during curing so

421
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,360
i have to save that for another study i

422
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,879
just want to say that i think it's

423
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,159
awesome that they did this study

424
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,679
and that they're sharing the results

425
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,439
with the public i personally don't think

426
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,919
that we can truly conclude that flushing

427
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,000
has

428
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,759
zero benefit but i do think that the

429
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,759
study is absolutely a step in the right

430
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,679
direction so thank you to rxscreen

431
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,879
technologies for doing the study and

432
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,078
sharing with all of us

433
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:43,919
i'd love to know in the comments section

434
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,278
below what are some of the reasons that

435
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,679
you heard to flush at the end of the

436
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:47,360
grow

437
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:48,719
what do you think about this study if

438
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
you currently flush at the end of the

439
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,959
grow

440
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,639
after hearing this information are you

441
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,399
going to continue to flush or are you

442
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,079
not going to flush anymore i personally

443
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,320
love to read studies about this

444
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,519
so if any of you have any links to any

445
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,800
studies that have been done

446
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,720
it doesn't have to be about flushing it

447
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,319
could be about any grow process

448
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,519
please link them down in the description

449
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,200
section below and maybe i'll make a

450
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,320
video on it in the future that's pretty

451
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,920
much it for this video guys if you

452
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,839
enjoyed it please click that thumbs up

453
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:15,759
and i will leave it at that thank you so

454
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,760
much for watching and until next time

455
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
