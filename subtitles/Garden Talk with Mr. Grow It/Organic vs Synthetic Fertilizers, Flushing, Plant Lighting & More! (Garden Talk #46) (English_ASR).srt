1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
coming up on garden talk as a general

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:09,439
rule we have found that about 80 percent

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,638
nitrate and 20

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:16,160
ammonium keeps a very stable ph in the

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:18,960
root zone organic fertilizers break down

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,759
to the same exact elements that

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,240
synthetic fertilizers provide so

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,760
chemically there's no difference but

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,559
it's the stress that improved the

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,118
terpenes not the organics per se so what

11
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,280
that means is precision stress could

12
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,119
lead to more terpenes and especially

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,679
precision stress can lead to more

14
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:40,078
cannabinoids if we put the plants in the

15
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:43,200
dark we're taking away their energy

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,039
source to synthesize terpenes

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,280
certainly lots of growers do this so

18
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,039
it's a common practice but that just

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,520
because it's common doesn't mean it's

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,520
correct

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,079
what's up everybody if you that don't

22
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,439

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,320
science everything from synthetic versus

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,799

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,560
additives and ph regulators they have

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,879
different formulas of base nutrients for

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,960
if you're in soil or if you're in hydro

52
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,280
or cocoa they also formulate their base

53
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:10,318
nutrients for if you're using hard water

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,560

of yours i'm enrolled in the cultivation

81
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,840
certification that you offer at utah

82
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,199
state university and i'm learning a ton

83
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,439
right now so

84
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,958
so much amazing science about the plant

85
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,639
that we all know and love

86
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,560

share information today so thank you for

90
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,079
that yeah happy to be here usually what

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,000
we do is we'll start off with an

92
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,680
introduction so can you tell us a little

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,878
bit about yourself and how you got into

94
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,400
this space

95
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:39,759
oh god if we went way back i i got

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,599
i started in college in engineering and

97
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,598
and for me that meant building things

98
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,839
and building boxes and i

99
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,839
got onto the idea of building plywood

100
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,759
boxes to test different plant

101
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,560
environment interactions

102
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,639
this is a long time ago and

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,479
so i did i built those boxes and a lot

104
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,199
of other gizmos

105
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,518
and i go through graduate school i was

106
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,878
at the university of minnesota

107
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,360
then i was at the university of

108
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,318
california davis and then it was at penn

109
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,959
state

110
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:11,759
so different degrees different schools

111
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,239
and then my first job out of college was

112
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,679
the position here in utah utah state

113
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,560
university

114
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,478
and

115
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,079
i had the opportunity

116
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,439
to early on

117
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,040
to write a proposal to nasa for growing

118
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,360
plants in space

119
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,600
that proposal got funded and then as

120
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,040
people say the rest is history

121
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
i've been now

122
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,520
here for 40 years

123
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,160
working on plant environment

124
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:41,359
interactions in growth chambers

125
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,639
and the 1980s 90s 2000s all of this

126
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,680
stuff was funded by nasa for food crops

127
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,918
and then

128
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,560
the potential to work on botanical

129
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,439
medicines came along

130
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,560
and

131
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:56,399
growers subsequently have funded our

132
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,639
research growers and some lighting

133
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,879
companies uh

134
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,439
so we we got into

135
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,719
a medical hemp research in

136
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,600
the last

137
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,919
four years and it plugs right into the

138
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,639
large infrastructure we already have in

139
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:15,279
the in the laboratory we have we have

140
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,840
something like 45 grill chambers

141
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:20,239
here to in you know manipulate

142
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,399
environments for the plants and then

143
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,400
and then the laboratory is connected to

144
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,560
greenhouses so it's

145
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,279
growth chambers and greenhouses adjacent

146
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,199
to

147
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,719
each other awesome

148
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,199
let's jump right into the juicy

149
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,680
questions so in your reddit ama that you

150
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,080
did a few months back you said quote i'm

151
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,560
not a fan of organic fertilizers in my

152
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,478
opinion organic agriculture is not

153
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,478
always good for the environment and it's

154
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,639
not always good for human health other

155
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,959
than that organic is great for recycling

156
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,280
waste back to gardens and farms this

157
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,959
recycling saved the planet end quote can

158
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,119
you elaborate on what you meant by

159
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,719
saying that organic agriculture is not

160
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,360
always good for the environment and not

161
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,440
always good for human health

162
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,280
yeah i i understand my

163
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,639
those those were my comments and they

164
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,239
still are

165
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,240
and they understand that shocked a lot

166
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,478
of people i mean they didn't people

167
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,519
didn't expect me to say that

168
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:12,560
um

169
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,279
but i

170
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,399
i really got into agriculture because of

171
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:20,159
organic agriculture i mean many decades

172
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,159
ago

173
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,479
i was going to save the planet through

174
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,160
better more sustainable agricultural

175
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,318
production

176
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,000
and this is in minnesota but i started

177
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,479
growing vegetables and i had a little

178
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,560
roadside stand and it was organic and

179
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:38,240
then i started studying it and i went

180
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,600
back to school in agriculture

181
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,478
and

182
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,680
let me start by saying the principles

183
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:48,000
of recycling are just a gold standard we

184
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,598
absolutely need to recycle things back

185
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,720
to agriculture

186
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:55,279
way more than we do it's a huge issue

187
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,360
and that is a fundamental tenet of

188
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,758
organic agriculture

189
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,479
recycle things back to agriculture

190
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:06,000
recycle the nutrients so

191
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:08,560
that's a that's a terrific gold standard

192
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,680
now we get into the details of doing

193
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,120
that

194
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,680
and one example is

195
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,399
manures which we rely on heavily for

196
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,079
nitrogen to recycle they need to be

197
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,318
recycled

198
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,240
but it turns out manures are very high

199
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,199
in phosphorus

200
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,519
so if you put on manure to get the

201
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,120
adequate nitrogen this is composted

202
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,719
manure now so it's

203
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,959
it's safe

204
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,720
because of official organic

205
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,879
standards require

206
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,919
significant composting to make sure it's

207
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:44,000
safe you can't just put fresh manure on

208
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,240
the but you put manure on to get

209
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,360
nitrogen and the phosphorus is way too

210
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,120
high

211
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,800
and you do it again the next year and

212
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,360
the next year in the phosphorus builds

213
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,199
up to very very high levels

214
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,520
and phosphorus is a serious

215
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,199
environmental pollutant

216
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,120
so we have a lot of

217
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,080
organic fields

218
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,519
that are putting phosphorus into lakes

219
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,598
and rivers

220
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,878
now what we really should do is put the

221
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:13,598
manure on to get adequate phosphorus

222
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,360
and find the nitrogen somewhere else

223
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,000
then then this problem would be gone and

224
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,840
we'd be recycling manure and we we could

225
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,639
put it on a lot more fields too because

226
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,918
we there's ample phosphorus

227
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,800
but that's

228
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,399
one example of the challenges of organic

229
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,639
agriculture

230
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,000
and really it comes down to precision

231
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,759
fertilization

232
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,440
not too much not too little the right

233
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,879
ratios of the nutrients at the right

234
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,719
time

235
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:44,799
and that's difficult to do with organics

236
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,800
you can you can sort of do it you get

237
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,039
rock phosphate and

238
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,719
green manures you know we can we can

239
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,079
approach it and certainly

240
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,320
my colleagues

241
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,759
are working on this at some other

242
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,839
universities um to recycle

243
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,838
nitrogen especially with green manures

244
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,200
growing a crop every other year all

245
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:09,279
those things this is all wonderful stuff

246
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,600
but in the application of it it

247
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,559
nutrients become imbalanced

248
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,159
and

249
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,958
there's a a danger to the environment

250
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,519
so

251
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,879
that's underappreciated by people that

252
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,759
are

253
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:26,080
enthusiasts for organics the principle

254
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,319
is good but there's been big challenges

255
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,240
in the application

256
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,800
now we can say that about conventional

257
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,120
agriculture too i mean we want to grow a

258
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,039
lot of food so we put synthetic

259
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,799
fertilizers on

260
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,958
and there's nothing really wrong with

261
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,039
synthetic fertilizers but boy do they

262
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,479
get over your used too

263
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:45,278
so it's not

264
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,278
like

265
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,679
conventional farming is

266
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,838
is all good and organic is bad it's not

267
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,838
that way at all it's the applications of

268
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,839
it are challenging

269
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,279
that's a long answer to the the

270
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,240
environmental

271
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,200
part of this but it's not always good to

272
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,919
uh

273
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,079
to

274
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,240
in our attempt to recycle everything we

275
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:08,479
get nutrient imbalances that have

276
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,720
environmental consequences

277
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,959
got it that makes sense yeah synthetic

278
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,399
fertilizers they they have a bad rep you

279
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,119
know i think we're officially in the

280
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,278
generation where organic growing is a

281
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,759
growing trend there are bad things about

282
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,519
synthetic nutrients such as the runoffs

283
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,000
of nitrogen and phosphorus into lakes

284
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,519
and streams causing toxic algae blooms

285
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,360
but there are also some good things

286
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,799
about them such as the fact that because

287
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,800
of their invention we can now feed the

288
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,399
world can you talk to us about some of

289
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,919
the pros and cons of synthetic

290
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,440
fertilizers and maybe some

291
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,519
misinformation that you've heard about

292
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,160
them well first of all

293
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,600
synthetic fertilizers allow precision

294
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,919
fertilization

295
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,040
so as a principle this is really a good

296
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:50,000
thing

297
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,000
but now does every grower do precision

298
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,399
fertilization oh man is there a lot of

299
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
examples of

300
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,839
over-application of of

301
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,240
fertilizers

302
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,959
i've listened to a talk at the national

303
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,278
agronomy meetings last month

304
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,039
it was

305
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,720
about

306
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,360
one of my colleagues at the university

307
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,360
of california patrick brown

308
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,839
who was a just a really good speaker

309
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,519
well now he was given a keynote talk but

310
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,360
he was talking about fertilizing fruit

311
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,159
trees in california

312
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,839
and uh he made some joke about if you

313
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,000
don't know what you're doing put a

314
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,959
little more on and

315
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,440
more on

316
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,359
having a dual dual meaning

317
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,600
and evil people just kept putting more

318
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,519
on them um

319
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,320
and and there's that's california

320
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,959
agriculture of fruits and nuts and

321
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,720
and vegetables

322
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,639
and and they have a tough time getting

323
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,639
growers to back off

324
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,958
because they get paid by yield

325
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,639
they don't get there's no penalty for

326
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:54,838
polluting the environment that's

327
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:57,039
synthetic fertilizers that they're using

328
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,320
um the

329
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:00,879
after that

330
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,320
let's just take nitrogen

331
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:05,360
we get

332
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,278
almost all of the nitrogen

333
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,839
from fossil fuels

334
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,919
and it's called the haber bosch process

335
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,480
two german scientists

336
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:17,599
uh around world war one both of them got

337
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,000
it the nobel prize it's considered this

338
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,200
great breakthrough of the falls of

339
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,078
science

340
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,278
and they figured out how to make

341
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:29,519
nitrogen fertilizer from the nitrogen in

342
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,919
the air and there's plenty of nitrogen

343
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,759
in the air and this is a wonderful thing

344
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,639
and this is what's allowed us to feed a

345
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:39,039
whole bunch more people in the planet

346
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,480
but boy does it take a lot of fossil

347
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:45,199
fuels

348
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,120
so we need to recycle nitrogen

349
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,759
that one one of the actual projects

350
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,078
we're working on right now with nasa

351
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:55,439
is recycling nitrogen in a mars colony

352
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:57,039
how are you going to get nitrogen on

353
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,200
mars but they don't they have minimal

354
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:02,240
nitrogen in their atmosphere

355
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,440
and it's so expensive we recycle every

356
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,720
molecule of nitrogen in this colony

357
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,000
and you're sitting here doing this

358
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,959
research and

359
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,639
my god we need to be doing that on earth

360
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:15,119
um

361
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,039
humans we we

362
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,600
excrete

363
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:22,000
12 to 20 grams

364
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,639
of urea

365
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,720
per day in our urine

366
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,799
and all of it goes

367
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,519
none of it's recycled just goes into

368
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:34,399
landfills and i envisioned the day when

369
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,839
we're going to have small scale

370
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,000
separators

371
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,440
to separate the salt and urine from the

372
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,879
nitrogen

373
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,760
and and as

374
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,159
as

375
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,919
unpleasant as it might sound

376
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,039
you can purify urine and get the

377
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,439
nitrogen

378
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:52,240
and put that right back in your garden

379
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,600
but none of that's done yet but i but we

380
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,919
need to do it

381
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,240
and if we keep saying oh put a little

382
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,639
more on and then we're never going to

383
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,278
get there with recycling so the

384
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,198
principles are rock solid

385
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:08,159
but what i don't like about organic

386
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:10,719
agriculture is just this complete ban on

387
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,799
all synthetic fertilizers

388
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,360
okay we we don't often

389
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:20,159
get to good places as a human species by

390
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,159
banning things we try to change behavior

391
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,839
so so that's a that's a challenge but

392
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,198
some hybrid between recycling through

393
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,000
organics

394
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:33,039
and and limited use of synthetics i

395
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,958
think is a really good approach

396
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,879
that's super interesting i actually came

397
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,319
across a fantastic study that talks

398
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,240
about what would need to happen in order

399
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,720
to feed the world with organic

400
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,120
agriculture long story short switching

401
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,519
to 100 organic production leads to

402
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,720
further increases in land use between 16

403
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,519
and 33

404
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,278
in order to make up for the lower yields

405
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,639
that organic growing results in

406
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,720
according to the study it's on an

407
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,839
average of eight percent lower yields

408
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,440
with organic agriculture up to 25 lower

409
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,880
yields depending on the plant so i

410
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,240
thought that was super interesting i

411
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:05,919
actually provide a link to that study

412
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,680
down in the youtube description section

413
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,000
below for those of you of tuning in on

414
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,000
youtube study is titled strategies for

415
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,919
feeding the world more sustainably with

416
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,120
organic agriculture and this was but

417
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,039
this was posted in nature's

418
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,240
communications so definitely give that a

419
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,159
read if you're interested in learning

420
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,919
more about that now there are some girls

421
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,799
out there that say that the terpene

422
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:27,120
profile for organically grown plants is

423
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:29,359
better than with plants grown with

424
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,639
synthetic fertilizers is there any truth

425
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,639
to that or is that just a myth

426
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,799
as a scientist

427
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,720
i just say the data points in this

428
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:42,000
direction i mean

429
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,800
i wouldn't say that's a myth but i would

430
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,958
say

431
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,799
we don't have any good evidence to

432
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,359
support it

433
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,120
and in spite of looking we can't ever

434
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,399
say it would never happen but we don't

435
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,959
have any evidence to support it

436
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,958
supported

437
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:58,559
as a general principle

438
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:04,240
terpenes and cannabinoids

439
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,479
both are what we call secondary

440
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,320
metabolites

441
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,839
that means they're not the plants don't

442
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,759
have to make them the plant will grow

443
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,800
just fine without them

444
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,919
but they

445
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,240
they uh

446
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,958
plants make secondary metabolites like

447
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,799
lignin make to so they stand up straight

448
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,879
and be tough that's a secondary

449
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:24,799
metabolite you could grow a plant with

450
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,639
all cellulose

451
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,120
so here's these secondary metabolites

452
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,959
and we know that if you

453
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,919
stress plants precision stress plants

454
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:38,000
they often make more secondary

455
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,639
metabolites

456
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,120
so what that means is precision stress

457
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,198
could lead to more terpenes

458
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,159
and especially precision stress can lead

459
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:51,039
to more cannabinoids now this is a very

460
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:54,719
active area of research in my lab right

461
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:57,679
now precision stress of of plants to

462
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,839
improve quality

463
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,799
so when you make a broad when someone

464
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,318
makes a broad statement organics improve

465
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,119
terpenes

466
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:09,519
well what's the mechanism for that

467
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,798
and there is a potential mechanism if

468
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:14,558
the plants were slightly stressed

469
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:17,519
but it's the stress that improved the

470
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:20,639
terpenes not the organics per se

471
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:23,599
so now we look at refining it so that's

472
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,720
that's why i call this precision stress

473
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,959
rather than just just general stress

474
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,839
it's just the right amount of stress in

475
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,960
the right way at the right

476
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,359
time so when

477
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,679
i i've no doubt people have done studies

478
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,599
like this when i say people and studies

479
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,440
i mean growers

480
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:42,959
have done a comparison that's a better

481
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,240
way to put it

482
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,640
and

483
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,400
they might have seen more terpenes

484
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,280
and often

485
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,120
if if they don't are not

486
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,119
have a background in the scientific

487
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,359
method they don't repeat the study they

488
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,199
just make one observation

489
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,519
and then they're sure

490
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,919
that organic

491
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,839
nutrients increase terpenes and they

492
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,120
make announcements and they're just sure

493
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,279
of it and

494
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,038
boy can you get into trouble as a

495
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,839
scientist if you

496
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:16,558
make some announcement you're wrong your

497
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:19,038
reputation goes right in the toilet so

498
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:21,519
all you ever say is the data indicates

499
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:23,440
this and we've repeated it four times

500
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,839
and here's the here's the difference we

501
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,519
also can say here's the mechanism by

502
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,480
which this happens

503
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:32,400
not just an observation

504
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,480
one of the analogies i've used sometimes

505
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,480
is

506
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,639
planting at the full moon

507
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,960
and 100 years ago in agriculture that

508
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,400
was a thing you should plant at the full

509
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,880
moon you'll you'll get better yields and

510
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,440
of course that's been studied and what's

511
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,240
the mechanism of that you know there is

512
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,080
no mechanism but probably what it was is

513
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,798
people could see better at the full moon

514
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,879
so they've got the spacing right

515
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,240
but there wasn't there's no mechanism

516
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,440
for

517
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,359
a value of planting at the full moon

518
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,320
so because there's no mechanism we think

519
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,479
the observations are just random chance

520
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,159
well said another thing i often hear is

521
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,240
people say that synthetic fertilizers

522
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,240
kill off all microbes when you feed in

523
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,798
synthetic nutrients you're wiping out

524
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,640
your micro populations are microbes

525
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,798
killed with synthetic fertilizers or is

526
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,640
that another thing that the data doesn't

527
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:27,038
really back it up yet

528
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,919
no they're not and and

529
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:29,440
of course

530
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,038
i'm going to make this point i think

531
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,240
most people know this but i want to make

532
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,038
the point

533
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,839
organic fertilizers break down

534
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:40,879
to the same exact elements that

535
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:43,599
synthetic fertilizers provide

536
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,559
so chemically there's no difference at

537
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:49,199
all they aren't taken up by the plants

538
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:52,399
until they're degraded to the elements

539
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,720
nitro nitrate ammonium phosphate the

540
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,840
exact same elements

541
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,640
so

542
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:01,839
if if you put

543
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,120
a ton of fertilizer on i mean some cup

544
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:05,279
per plant

545
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:08,558
of synthetic fertilizer

546
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:10,079
you would kill the plant and you would

547
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:12,319
you wouldn't kill the microbes because

548
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:15,038
they're really hardy but you would sure

549
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,960
shift the microbial population

550
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,038
if you if you over fertilize it just

551
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,759
because of the salt stress

552
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,960
um so that now you can see where i'm

553
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,279
going with this stuff what's the

554
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,120
mechanism what's the mechanism

555
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,440
but certainly

556
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,599
if the fertilization is

557
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,279
near optimal

558
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,279
there's there could be a

559
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:39,119
equally be a beneficial effect on

560
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:40,798
microbes as a detrimental effect

561
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,359
microbes

562
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,200
have to have a source of energy

563
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:48,639
and that source of energy

564
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,159
is usually some organic carbon

565
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,679
um

566
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,679
i mean in

567
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,559
simplest case you could just put some

568
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,400
sugar

569
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,480
on the soil and the microbes would go

570
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,038
wild you'd be to have a

571
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,679
huge flush of microbes and you say well

572
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:06,240
that's too much but how about we

573
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,400
just take compost and partially degraded

574
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,359
compost and put it in there that will

575
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,360
stimulate microbial activity

576
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:15,519
now whether that also stimulates plant

577
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:19,678
growths is another matter it would not

578
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:21,038
necessarily stimulate plant growth

579
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,440
but that's

580
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:26,079
the opposite of synthetic fertilizers

581
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,480
synthetic fertilizers don't have

582
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:31,759
organic matter in them

583
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,000
they're just the elements and uh

584
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,000
organic fertilizers because they have

585
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,798
organic compounds in them

586
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,079
will stimulate microbial activity and

587
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,079
and generally

588
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,119
as a general rule that's a good thing

589
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,759
you want

590
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,959
healthy microbial activity in the

591
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:47,839
soil

592
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,240
but

593
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:52,399
so does root turnover a big plant

594
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,000
stimulates microbial activity because

595
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,519
you have a lot of roots and the roots

596
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,759
turn over and microbes thrive on the

597
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:03,599
decaying roots of an older plant

598
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,240
it's a long answer but

599
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:08,319
the short answer is no there's

600
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,558
no relationship between synthetic

601
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:12,960
fertilizers and

602
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,879
killing the microbes

603
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,640
got it that makes sense

604
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,600
let's flip it up let's talk about soil

605
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,600
versus soilless media so another trend

606
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:23,359
is growing in soil you know many growers

607
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,439
work towards feeding the soil instead of

608
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:28,158
feeding the plants so relying on micro

609
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,519
and macro organisms to work in the soil

610
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,679
ultimately resulting in the plant

611
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:32,960
receiving nutrition that way

612
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,960
on the other hand

613
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,120
one could argue that soil speedy has

614
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,279
more benefits it is a medium more

615
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,879
optimized for growing medicinal plants

616
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,359
can you talk to us about the benefits of

617
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,280
soilless media you know porosity water

618
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,959
holding capacity cat iron exchange

619
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,558
capacity things like that

620
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,279
yeah interestingly enough this is

621
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,639
another active area of our research for

622
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:55,038
nasa

623
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,799
how are we going to grow plants on mars

624
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:59,839
you know we're going to haul earth soil

625
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:02,079
to mars but no way too heavy and we're

626
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,839
we also are not going to grow

627
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,399
and at least initially we're not going

628
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:09,279
to grow in mars soil

629
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,679
it's really a fine sand is is what's up

630
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:14,000
there it's not really soil means it has

631
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,720
microbial activity it's living

632
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,440
and so what we call mars is regalif it's

633
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,200
sterile and it's it's sterile sand all

634
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,279
right so

635
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,000
how do we turn that into a

636
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,158
healthy vibrant thing to to

637
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,558
feed a mars colony

638
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,400
so that that research has implications

639
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,279
for earth

640
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,559
well we could do liquid hydroponics

641
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,558
which we do a lot of in in the lab here

642
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:43,278
no media at all just deep flow

643
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:45,599
hydroponics roots and water

644
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:47,599
and that is the ultimate in precision

645
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:50,079
fertilization because you can change

646
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:51,599
nutrients on a dime and you know exactly

647
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:53,759
what's happening

648
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,879
but it's not buffered something goes

649
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,158
wrong

650
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,360
your plants can be dead in a hurry

651
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:04,000
so then we move to soilless media and

652
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:06,719
this can be rock wool could be coconut

653
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,640
choir it can be peat

654
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,278
many different things

655
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,360
but rock wall coconut choir and peat are

656
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:16,079
really the big three that that most

657
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,079
people use

658
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,080
that's

659
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,080
better buffered so

660
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:23,519
if you missed an irrigation your plants

661
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:24,480
wouldn't be dead

662
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,079
it has

663
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,558
they can store some nutrients um

664
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:34,079
that primarily and and it can have a

665
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:35,918
robust microbial community in it too

666
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,399
particularly

667
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,919
peat and coconut choir because those are

668
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,640
made out of

669
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,759
organic products to start with rockwool

670
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,440
is a little different because that's

671
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,960
just glass fibers

672
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,759
there's no organic matter in rock wall

673
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,200
and this then gets to a concept called

674
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:57,440
cat ion exchange capacity

675
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,080
which that the listeners if they get

676
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,080
interested in this please

677
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:04,319
apply to utah state university for

678
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:06,798
degree in plant science you'll learn all

679
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,480
this stuff in great detail and and if

680
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,879
you're interested in plants you love

681
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,200
coming here we'd love to have you as a

682
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,520
as a student here in our plant science

683
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,558
department you take whole classes and

684
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:21,359
what we're talking about right now

685
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:24,480
so rockwell doesn't have any cation

686
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,439
exchange capacity which means there's no

687
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,759
buffer

688
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,679
if you miss a fertilization

689
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,798
the nutrients are gone they washed out

690
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,960
of the pot

691
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:36,879
coconut choir and especially peat have a

692
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,919
reservoir of nutrients

693
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,919
the cations are bound to the media

694
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,840
and it buffers it if you put too much on

695
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:47,278
it soaks up the excess if you have too

696
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:49,599
little it desorbs back to the media

697
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:52,000
so now we're moving from straight liquid

698
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:53,439
culture which can be very precise but

699
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,839
fragile

700
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,480
to soilless media

701
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,079
which is better buffered and

702
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,000
for the long term

703
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:04,798
and then the third category would be

704
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,440
soil which is your original question

705
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,558
what about soil just go dig up field

706
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,679
soil

707
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,839
and then and we're going to make it

708
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,679
really nice we'll put lots of compost in

709
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,319
there

710
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,880
that that's a fine media

711
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:22,079
but when it's in a container it's very

712
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,880
tricky to keep it watered it's very easy

713
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:27,278
to over water it and flood it

714
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,360
and so you have a tall container to help

715
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:31,038
it drain

716
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,678
but that's why

717
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:35,599
traditional field soils

718
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,400
are not

719
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:42,399
generally used in containers

720
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,400
because it's so easy to flood the plants

721
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,080
it's possible to grow in them and we do

722
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,559
all the time because we're doing studies

723
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:50,839
to predict field responses but you sure

724
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:53,278
have to be careful about

725
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:55,599
watering and

726
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:58,400
the microbial activity

727
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:00,480
is determined by the

728
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,120
amount of food in the container for the

729
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,400
microbes um the amount of organic carbon

730
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:08,719
that they can

731
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:11,600
eat that they can utilize for energy

732
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,240
and soil has some organic carbon but

733
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,240
peat is all organic carbon

734
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,120
so the microbial activity is not

735
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,960
necessarily higher in soil than it is in

736
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,199
soilless media

737
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,120
another long answer i'm sorry

738
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,120
after you teach this stuff for 40 years

739
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,000
you start to get into it i love it the

740
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,720
more information the better our viewers

741
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,880
really like you know detailed answers to

742
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,839
the point the science behind things

743
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,840
so yeah i love it keep them coming

744
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:42,798
now in another one of your lectures you

745
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:44,720
talk about

746
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:47,119
feeding different types of nitrogen

747
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,360
ammonium and nitrate and you came across

748
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,519
some interesting results when feeding a

749
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:53,359
balance of the two can you talk to us

750
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,720
about what that study was about and your

751
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:56,158
findings there

752
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,960
first of all

753
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:02,080
in the field we virtually always have a

754
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,600
both forms of nitrogen we always do and

755
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:04,720
in some balance

756
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,480
um

757
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,798
and and often

758
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:13,440
as organic matter decays the first form

759
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:16,240
of of nitrogen is ammonium which is nh4

760
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,278
plus it's a it's a cation

761
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,679
um

762
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:23,839
and in forests that's the dominant form

763
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,840
of nitrogen that's feeding the plants

764
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,359
that

765
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:30,960
d decomposes

766
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:33,439
to nitrate no3 minus

767
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,679
and that's a microbially

768
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,200
mediated transformation it's it's called

769
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,960
nitrification

770
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,038
there's two different organisms it's

771
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,640
very cool take a whole class in this

772
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:46,319
that do this you know they work in

773
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:49,120
tandem to change ammonium to nitrate

774
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,038
but in the field plants almost always

775
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,158
get both forms

776
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,558
and

777
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,399
we've really long known that they're

778
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,359
synergistic

779
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:01,519
one's a cation one's an anion they help

780
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,278
the plants achieve what's called charge

781
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,158
balance because you have to have an

782
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:09,119
equal number of cations and anions they

783
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:12,000
stabilize ph right in the rhizosphere

784
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:14,879
the rhizosphere is right next to a root

785
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,240
they stabilize that ph

786
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,240
so

787
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,200
as a general rule

788
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,919
we

789
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,720
have found that about

790
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,799
eighty percent nitrate and twenty

791
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,200
percent ammonium

792
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,798
keeps a very stable ph

793
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,360
in the root zone

794
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:35,759
when i say about that that could be

795
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:38,000
plus a minus 10

796
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,038
depending on the conditions

797
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,679
um

798
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:44,158
but if we feed all nitrate

799
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,200
the ph goes up up up up up and that's

800
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,399
not good

801
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,399
if we feed too much ammonium the ph goes

802
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:51,678
down down down down down and that's not

803
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:52,719
good either

804
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,240
so this

805
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,440
roughly 80 20 balance helps the ph stay

806
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,679
stable

807
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,320
right at the root surface

808
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,080
and it for all the crops we've studied

809
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:07,278
it leads to

810
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:09,599
a healthier plant and faster growth

811
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:12,319
super interesting stuff there for sure i

812
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,000
got an environment question for you so

813
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:16,000
we know that it's not so much the

814
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,919
temperature of the environment but the

815
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,159
leaf surface temperature which is

816
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,679
impacting the rate of photosynthesis now

817
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,000
i often hear that it depends on the

818
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,798
plant you're growing and the genetics

819
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,960
but generally speaking 82 degrees

820
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:31,440
fahrenheit leaf surface temperature is

821
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,200
optimal is there any truth to that or

822
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,278
what's your take on that

823
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,960
i tell my students the correct answer to

824
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:38,558
every question i'm going to ask you is

825
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,519
it depends

826
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:43,678
and so i'm starting with it depends okay

827
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,639
now what does it depend on

828
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,399
um

829
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,399
but let's just take leaf temperature and

830
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:51,839
air temperature first just as not the

831
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:51,839
optimum but just what's the difference

832
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:57,519
a worst case scenario would be a cactus

833
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,679
in the desert

834
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,000
it's no water

835
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:06,240
and the sun is shining on the cactus and

836
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,159
the surface of the cactus can be

837
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,240
oh 20 it could be 20 degrees celsius

838
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,399
above air temperature

839
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,278
easily tens and that you double after

840
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:19,119
fahrenheit so 20 to 30 degrees

841
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,880
fahrenheit above air temperature of a

842
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,759
cactus in the desert

843
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,000
way different than air temperature

844
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,640
but now let's take the opposite

845
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,880
a well-watered plant

846
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:35,038
in in agriculture with a healthy root

847
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,919
system so now let's say

848
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:40,158
are the leaves warmer than the air or

849
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,000
cooler than the air

850
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,440
now most people would say well duh the

851
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,558
sun's shining on the leaves they're

852
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,159
always warmer than the air but what if

853
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:50,879
we took

854
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,840
a wet dish rag and hung it on the line

855
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,720
it's it's soaking wet

856
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:58,798
and it's evaporating real fast

857
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,278
would that dish rag be warmer than the

858
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:03,759
air or equal to the air temperature or

859
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:03,759
cooler

860
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,038
and it turns out the dish rag

861
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:11,518
will be cooler than air temperature

862
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:15,038
if it's a low humidity environment

863
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:17,599
low humidity means less than 50

864
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:20,000
so leaves are not necessarily always

865
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:22,480
hotter than the air it depends on how

866
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,880
watered how well watered the plants are

867
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,079
and what the humidity of the air is

868
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:31,039
sometimes they're cooler than the air

869
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,119
now let's take wind

870
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:35,599
what if the we have good wind speed and

871
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:38,479
we almost always have good wind speed

872
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:40,000
we'd like the leaves to be fluttering

873
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,480
like this

874
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,278
so what that means is the leaves cool

875
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:49,120
either warm up or cool off so they're

876
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:50,319
even closer to air temperature

877
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:52,959
so

878
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:55,759
we have a we have a manuscript on this

879
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,600
um a model with leaf temperatures and

880
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:59,200
and different kinds of lights different

881
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:01,759
conditions and

882
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,278
it's a validated model

883
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:06,158
but

884
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:08,000
well over 90 percent of the time the

885
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,760
leaves are within

886
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,679
in fahrenheit they're within three

887
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:15,440
degrees fahrenheit of air temperature

888
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,559
so it's not a wildly different

889
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,038
temperature

890
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,558
for starter starters if if you think oh

891
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,000
boy we got to control temperature

892
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:23,038
because that'll be way different than

893
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,599
the air

894
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:27,278
it is different but not a lot different

895
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:28,558
so

896
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:30,480
that's why

897
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:31,839
we get away with measuring air

898
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,000
temperature

899
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,278
and predicting plant performance from

900
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,359
that

901
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,919
because the leaves are close to the air

902
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:42,479
temperature in a well-watered plant

903
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,720
what if the plant runs out of water

904
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,440
the stomates close

905
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,480
transpiration goes down now the leaves

906
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,798
heat up

907
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,440
it's you know three four five six

908
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:55,278
degrees above air temperature

909
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,278
but in that case we got another problem

910
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:59,519
with they ran out of water if we don't

911
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:00,640
want them to do that we you fix the

912
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,079
problem

913
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,720
um

914
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,639
so now we're onto the second part of

915
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,679
your question what is the optimal

916
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,280
temperature

917
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,159
let's just say the leaves are at the

918
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,800
same temperature as the air all the time

919
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,919
what temperature should that be

920
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,519
for

921
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,719
if

922
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:23,440
the carbon dioxide is not enriched it's

923
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,439
just ambient

924
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,200
plants

925
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,119
have what's called photorespiration they

926
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,199
they have trouble distinguishing carbon

927
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,320
dioxide and oxygen

928
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:38,398
and at ambient co2

929
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,919
that means the temperature optimum is

930
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:42,398
lower

931
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,319
and it depends on the crop but often in

932
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:46,159
the low 20s

933
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,399
well it's in celsius

934
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,398
in the low 70s

935
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:53,039
fahrenheit

936
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:55,039
is an optimum temperature without co2

937
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:57,759
enrichment

938
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:00,079
now we elevate the co2 which we do all

939
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,320
the time for plants

940
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:05,119
in controlled environments

941
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,280
and we're spoon feeding the plants

942
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,240
carbon dioxide which is what they want

943
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,599
for photosynthesis

944
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,559
and to

945
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,960
make a lot of biochemistry simple

946
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:19,358
now they can go faster because they got

947
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,960
ample co2 so we can raise the

948
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:23,598
temperature

949
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,039
and that temperature gets in to the 80s

950
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,880
fahrenheit

951
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,519
um so

952
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,960
it's at least

953
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:35,119
a 5 to 10 degree fahrenheit increase in

954
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,559
optimum temperature

955
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:41,200
if the co2 is elevated

956
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:43,039
so there's another interaction with

957
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,000
co2

958
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,159
now

959
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,639
now that we said all of this which is a

960
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:50,799
whole bunch of stuff all at once

961
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:52,799
what really matters about temperature is

962
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,320
the flower bud temperature not the leaf

963
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,200
temperature

964
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,359
and those flower buds don't transpire as

965
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:00,879
much as the leaves it's a it's a clump

966
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:03,279
of tissue

967
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,960
flower buds can heat up well above air

968
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,519
temperature

969
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,880
and we when we look at optimum

970
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,719
conditions

971
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,480
we really ought to be looking at flower

972
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:14,480
bud temperatures

973
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,199
more than leaf temperatures

974
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,320
because we we see it all the time

975
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:20,799
they'll heat up

976
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,880
easily five degrees fahrenheit above air

977
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,280
temperature when the flower bud gets

978
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,599
bigger when it's closer to harvest

979
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,440
just because it's a big it's just a

980
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,838
clump of tissue

981
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,320
as opposed to a nice thin leaf

982
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,838
which can stay close to air temperature

983
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,838
wow some really good information there i

984
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:40,320
didn't know that about the flower

985
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:41,920
temperature so that that's it

986
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,760
and yeah there's a there's a big

987
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,358
discussion of that in one of our

988
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,280
manuscripts

989
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,039
if if you really want to dig into it

990
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,200
those manuscripts are written for other

991
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:53,119
scientists so they can be

992
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,759
tricky to read but

993
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,599
those discussions are certainly in there

994
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,520
awesome cool now i got some

995
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,359
controversial questions for you like i

996
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,880
mentioned before we started recording uh

997
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,119
most my audience is on the homego

998
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,039
science side of things and there's a lot

999
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,720
of things that people do in order to try

1000
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:10,719
to get a better result

1001
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:12,719
so for example some girls will put their

1002
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:16,319
plants in a period of darkness before

1003
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:18,319
harvest for example 48 hours of darkness

1004
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,280
or 72 hours of darkness then they'll

1005
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,960
harvest

1006
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,880
it said that the darkness period is when

1007
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,280
secondary metabolites are formed and

1008
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,960
tricompass fall into that category so

1009
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,960
giving your plant a period of darkness

1010
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,519
will either allow the plant to produce

1011
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,358
more trichomes and or

1012
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:35,519
allow the terpenes and cannabinoids to

1013
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:37,279
become more potent what's your take on

1014
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,519
that is leaving your plant in a period

1015
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,640
of darkness before harvesting beneficial

1016
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:42,000
at all

1017
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:44,159
that's one of those things i'm going to

1018
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,280
say we don't have any evidence that that

1019
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,399
helps

1020
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,560
but now let's back up to the theory

1021
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,119
when we say trichomes everywhere

1022
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,559
terpenes are and maybe trichomes are

1023
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,039
formed at night

1024
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:59,759
that's not correct they're they're

1025
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:02,639
synthesized out of the energy from

1026
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,079
photosynthesis the photosynthetic energy

1027
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:09,039
makes sugars especially sucrose

1028
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:13,359
and that sucrose is used to make the

1029
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:14,639
terpenes makes the the trichomes as well

1030
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:16,719
so

1031
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:19,440
if we put the plants in the dark we're

1032
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:22,719
taking away their energy source

1033
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,000
to synthesize terpenes

1034
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,000
so

1035
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
we haven't specifically done these

1036
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,280
studies here but my colleagues in other

1037
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,159
places have

1038
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,359
and

1039
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,960
as a general rule the terpenes are less

1040
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:36,960
when they're in the dark

1041
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,358
because they're respiring away all the

1042
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,920
sugar they can't make new terpenes

1043
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:44,960
because they're out of energy

1044
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,358
so my recommendation to growers and this

1045
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,039
is based on principles and what i think

1046
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:53,199
are best practices keep the lights on

1047
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:55,279
now right right to the end

1048
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,838
and there is even some people that you

1049
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,920
could go to 24 hours of light

1050
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:01,679
because if they don't need to trigger

1051
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,920
any more reproductive development they

1052
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:07,919
just want to push the plant hard that's

1053
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,920
the other extreme the opposite

1054
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,480
but

1055
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,000
cool temperatures

1056
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,960
can reduce the volatilization which is

1057
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,239
the evaporation of terpenes

1058
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,720
and if they're in the dark and cold

1059
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:26,319
now the cold temperature might help

1060
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,078
it's not the dark but it's the cold

1061
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,320
temperature

1062
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,039
so there could be some evidence for

1063
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,400
keeping the plants keeping the lights on

1064
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:38,320
but reducing the temperature

1065
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,639
that and if i had to go off of

1066
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,119
mechanistic studies that's what i would

1067
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:45,118
recommend reduce the temperature

1068
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,680
but then you're reducing the development

1069
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,559
of the plant and if it's cold it doesn't

1070
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:53,279
synthesize new terpenes as fast

1071
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:55,599
so it's it's not clear to me that

1072
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,400
the coldness would really help

1073
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,800
it would help preserve terpenes but it

1074
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,800
would not help the plant synthesize new

1075
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,240
terpenes

1076
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,400
and the fact that we're smelling the

1077
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:08,879
plant at all which you do

1078
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,400
that means the terpenes are coming off

1079
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,240
that's what makes the

1080
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,760
smell in the first place

1081
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:15,598
um

1082
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,319
but i think we ought to put more

1083
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,039
emphasis on continued synthesis of

1084
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:22,318
terpenes right to the last day of

1085
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:25,679
harvest

1086
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:27,358
and less evidence the less emphasis on

1087
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:28,639
doing something to preserve what's

1088
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,838
already there

1089
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:31,679
i think that information is going to

1090
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:32,799
open up a lot of people's eyes that's uh

1091
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,719
you definitely mentioned some things

1092
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,960
that i wasn't aware of

1093
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:38,799
and i think that really provides a lot

1094
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,079
of information and regards to those

1095
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,480
folks that are

1096
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,160
in belief of that happening kind of give

1097
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,400
some background and some science to

1098
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:49,118
refute that one so thanks for sharing

1099
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,639
that now chris let me add to this

1100
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,800
um

1101
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:54,799
right at the moment of harvest now you

1102
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,599
clip the plant now there's not more

1103
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,800
photosynthesis it's starting to dry out

1104
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,559
and and

1105
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,359
now you can cool it off to try and

1106
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:04,480
preserve terpenes during curing of the

1107
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:06,719
plant

1108
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,000
but that's different because once you

1109
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:10,078
clip it

1110
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,318
it's starting to dry out and

1111
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,160
within hours photosynthesis the

1112
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:16,480
snowmates close right away

1113
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:17,440
photosynthesis is minimal so

1114
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,519
but but

1115
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,880
the question was right before harvest

1116
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,000
not right after

1117
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,400
so

1118
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,559
gotcha so another technique that's often

1119
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,920
done by gardeners growing with synthetic

1120
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:32,000
fertilizers is flushing or leaching

1121
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,240
before harvest organic growers generally

1122
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,719
don't do this but many synthetic growers

1123
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:38,318
are adamant that a flush is needed prior

1124
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:40,239
to harvest in order to

1125
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:42,079
reduce the amount of chlorophyll

1126
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:45,039
ultimately leading to a bit faster over

1127
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,280
cure and a better tasting final product

1128
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:49,039
what's your take on flushing or leaching

1129
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,359
before harvest when using synthetic

1130
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:53,119
fertilizers

1131
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:55,759
certainly lots of growers do this so

1132
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,200
it's a common practice

1133
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,560
but that just because it's common

1134
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:01,759
doesn't mean it's correct

1135
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,599
if

1136
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,160
the plant

1137
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,079
was over fertilized and sometimes we

1138
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:12,480
over fertilize on purpose to get some

1139
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:15,039
osmotic stress some salt stress

1140
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,440
then there's the potential for flushing

1141
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:19,279
out the excess nutrients

1142
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,960
and that helps the plant take up more

1143
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,599
water

1144
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,599
that it

1145
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,200
it's hard for the plant to get water out

1146
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,358
of salty soil and and if there's excess

1147
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:33,598
nutrients that's all salts so you get

1148
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:36,400
rid of the excess and now it's just more

1149
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,760
pure water and it the plant can hydrate

1150
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,760
better

1151
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,040
so

1152
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,839
that's there's a case where flushing

1153
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:47,920
has the potential to be helpful

1154
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:49,920
but if there were no

1155
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,960
excess nutrients

1156
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:56,480
right up to the end of the growth cycle

1157
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,760
i don't see any mechanism that flushing

1158
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,480
would help

1159
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,040
now

1160
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,960
in that case it's a it's a stress it's a

1161
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:05,679
you're getting let's take nitrogen you

1162
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,000
need nitrogen to make chlorophyll

1163
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:10,559
you get rid of the nitrogen chlorophyll

1164
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,880
synthesis would start to go down

1165
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:16,480
but that's a slow process the plant has

1166
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,240
to exhaust all of the stored nitrogen in

1167
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,880
itself because plants store nitrogen

1168
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,639
they store nitrate and vacuoles

1169
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,920
and that can take

1170
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:28,400
at least several days if not a week to

1171
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,400
exhaust that

1172
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,680
so

1173
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,160
i don't see a mechanistic link

1174
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:38,399
between the value of flushing

1175
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:39,679
and and product quality

1176
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,440
if the plant

1177
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:42,719
didn't have excess nutrients in the

1178
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,000
first place

1179
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:46,318
and it's interesting you mentioned

1180
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,239
organic growers usually don't do that

1181
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:49,358
well maybe they didn't have any excess

1182
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:51,199
nutrients

1183
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:54,400
they had just the right amount so why

1184
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:55,598
would you go less than that

1185
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,280
chlorophylls

1186
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,680
interesting

1187
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,800
people don't realize that the half-life

1188
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:05,118
of a chlorophyll molecule in a plant

1189
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,280
is two days

1190
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,039
plants are always making new chlorophyll

1191
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,680
it does a lot of work it breaks down to

1192
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:12,719
make new chlorophyll

1193
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:15,679
so

1194
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:17,679
at the moment of harvest the chlorophyll

1195
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:19,838
starts breaking down

1196
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:23,679
and then and a half-life means half of

1197
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:25,838
it's gone in two days so there plenty of

1198
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:28,399
opportunity to get rid of chlorophyll

1199
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:29,519
right after harvest during the curing

1200
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,920
process

1201
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:34,880
and in fact that's a big part of curing

1202
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,400
just the right speed just you want some

1203
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,160
things to break down

1204
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,200
for sure you want the to get rid of

1205
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:43,759
excess water so you can store it

1206
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:46,318
but anyway that's another topic that the

1207
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,839
curing side of things the quick answer

1208
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:50,318
is

1209
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:52,159
with with some rare exceptions i don't

1210
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:53,679
see the value of flushing

1211
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:55,358
before harvest

1212
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:58,559
now some growers that we've worked at

1213
00:44:55,358 --> 00:45:00,880
this tried it both ways and they

1214
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:03,838
it doesn't prove anything except in

1215
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,119
their operation they didn't see a value

1216
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:06,960
of flushing

1217
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,119
this was a pretty big grower that had

1218
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,880
been flushing and i said we don't have

1219
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,200
any evidence that helps and and they

1220
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,680
said okay we'll try it both ways

1221
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:17,199
and they found it didn't matter

1222
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:19,039
interesting he definitely changed my

1223
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:20,480
stance on flushing a little bit there's

1224
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:21,759
some things that you mentioned that i

1225
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,599
wasn't aware of so that's definitely

1226
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,119
good stuff there

1227
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,280
now moving right along to drying and

1228
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,960
curing have you done any studies on

1229
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,079
drying and curing that you can talk to

1230
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,519
us about

1231
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:35,280
there

1232
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:37,838
yes and we're about to do a lot more um

1233
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,800
particularly most of our studies have

1234
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:41,920
been

1235
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,599
rate of drying um you can dry plants in

1236
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:47,838
two days and you can dry them in two

1237
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:50,960
weeks the flower buds um and

1238
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:54,960
that to me the word drying

1239
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:57,838
applies to the rapid loss of water

1240
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,119
that occurs in the first 24 hours after

1241
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,838
harvest

1242
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:05,039
if the plants are full of water

1243
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:06,639
and botrytis for example can go wild on

1244
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,800
a flower that's

1245
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:10,400
got plenty of water in it

1246
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,400
and the way we get rid of

1247
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,240
botrytis and all the other microbes that

1248
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,358
can grow on the flowers just to dry it

1249
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:16,559
out

1250
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:19,199
so

1251
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:19,920
the so we dry it fast

1252
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:23,039
and

1253
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,119
maybe 24 hours now i'm using the term 24

1254
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,358
hours not one day

1255
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:30,640
because this stuff is hour by hour maybe

1256
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:33,039
it's 12 hours maybe it's 16 maybe it's

1257
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:35,759
28 hours but you want to set your

1258
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:38,719
stopwatch and watch this stuff dry fast

1259
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,560
you don't we don't want to over dry it

1260
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:43,199
but we want to get it dry enough so the

1261
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:45,679
micro microbial counts are low that's a

1262
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:48,318
very big deal plenty of places for

1263
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:51,919
microbes to grow in a flower

1264
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:53,519
then we cure it and so now i use the

1265
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,200
term curing

1266
00:46:53,519 --> 00:47:00,639
for a real slow loss of water

1267
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:02,399
that happens over many days and two

1268
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:04,400
weeks

1269
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,358
two weeks is about as long as i've seen

1270
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,680
people

1271
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:09,759
curing

1272
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:12,480
chlorophyll degrades

1273
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,640
additional water is lost you're trying

1274
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,159
to preserve the terpenes trying to keep

1275
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:18,879
those in the flower

1276
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:21,519
the cannabinoids aren't going anywhere

1277
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,519
they don't evaporate they're there they

1278
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:27,599
get concentrated because you're losing

1279
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:27,599
water but you're not losing cannabinoids

1280
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,039
and

1281
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:35,039
we talk about the water activity of the

1282
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:36,960
flower

1283
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:39,119
and that's water activity is a number

1284
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,838
between zero and one

1285
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,920
one is fully hydrated like right when

1286
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:46,078
it's growing the water activity is

1287
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,358
probably 0.99

1288
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,440
you harvest

1289
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:52,960
two days later it starts to dry out and

1290
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,838
then the water activity is 0.8

1291
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,079
now

1292
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:58,078
at a water activity of 0.8

1293
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,680
not many microbes can keep growing

1294
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:04,240
you've gotten rid of 95 of the microbes

1295
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:07,598
but some can still grow with real low

1296
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:12,078
water activity so we take it from water

1297
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:14,559
activity of 0.8 down to 0.6

1298
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,519
and at 0.6

1299
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:20,319
microbes can't grow it's too dry

1300
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:22,800
and now you can when it's fully cured

1301
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:25,039
the middle of the flower is dry

1302
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,880
the edge of the flower is dry

1303
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:29,599
now you can put that bud in a jar and

1304
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:33,358
keep it for a long long time it's too

1305
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:35,039
dry for microbes to grow

1306
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:37,679
so that's that's

1307
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:38,960
separating drying and curing

1308
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:40,078
for the uh

1309
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,480
plants

1310
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,720
and you would think we would learn a lot

1311
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:48,480
from the tobacco literature right we've

1312
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:51,759
been growing tobacco for 100 years and

1313
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:54,480
we talk about curing tobacco

1314
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,480
and i'm a bit surprised there's not as

1315
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,280
much literature on

1316
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,318
precision curing of tobacco as you might

1317
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,480
think

1318
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:04,400
and maybe part of it's because it's done

1319
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,079
by private companies

1320
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,480
and and they try to keep their curing

1321
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:11,680
methods confidential

1322
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:16,719
but it's the same thing but curing

1323
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:18,960
anything um any any medicinal plants um

1324
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:20,318
how do we how do we take basil and make

1325
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,639
dried basil

1326
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:24,880
that's the same thing we want that basil

1327
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:28,000
to be really flavorful

1328
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,760
and aromatic and still dry so you can

1329
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,599
put it in a jar and

1330
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,559
ship it around to people

1331
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:37,200
we can learn a lot about curing from

1332
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:39,280
other types of food products because the

1333
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:41,519
principles are all the same

1334
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,720
got it got it definitely some good stuff

1335
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:44,000
there

1336
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:46,799
let's flip it up let's talk about

1337
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,400
lighting so i'd say most of my audience

1338
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:52,480
is familiar with par ppfd ppf

1339
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,240
but dli is something that i think a lot

1340
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,400
of people are getting tripped up on

1341
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:58,879
can you talk to us about dli and what's

1342
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:03,760
optimal for medicinal plants

1343
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:05,760
the word so dli is daily light integral

1344
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,920
and once you get this then you can say

1345
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,280
that you understand calculus because

1346
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,358
it's an integral

1347
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:15,599
and calculus is a pretty scary word um

1348
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:18,799
but integral is just

1349
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:21,119
adding things up over the day

1350
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,680
and a really good analogy that i have

1351
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:26,240
used and my colleagues use it too

1352
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:27,759
is a rain gauge

1353
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:29,358
you go out and check your rain gauge at

1354
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,280
the end of the day

1355
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:33,358
and you don't really care when it rained

1356
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,519
you just care how much it rained and

1357
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:39,519
let's say you got an inch of rain

1358
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:42,239
that's the rainfall integral for the day

1359
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:45,358
and now you imagine a tray out there

1360
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:47,279
with raindrops falling into it

1361
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:49,519
and we don't care if it rained hard for

1362
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,680
a while and light for a while at the end

1363
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:52,880
of the day we care how what's the total

1364
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:54,639
amount

1365
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,400
of rain

1366
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:57,838
and it's the same thing with photons

1367
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:03,119
coming in

1368
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:06,159
we measure ppf ppfd par in per second

1369
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:08,559
okay but that's the plant says i want to

1370
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:11,838
know how much i'm going to get per day

1371
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:14,160
not per second so we add it up

1372
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:16,880
and that results in the number called

1373
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:17,838
the daily like integral

1374
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,119
and

1375
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:20,838
those numbers

1376
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,200
outside range

1377
00:51:20,838 --> 00:51:24,719
from five

1378
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:27,199
well first of all

1379
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:29,838
we talk about micro moles per meter

1380
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:33,039
squared per second for instantaneous

1381
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:34,639
light ppf and ppfd

1382
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:36,960
and you add them up

1383
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:38,159
and those all those micro moles become

1384
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,079
moles

1385
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:43,358
so it's moles per meter squared per day

1386
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,800
and that's

1387
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:48,880
daily the integral the unit of that

1388
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:52,079
and at the low end in the winter we

1389
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,200
might get five moles per meter squared

1390
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,640
per day

1391
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:58,879
and a sunny day in the summer we get 60

1392
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:59,838
moles per meter squared per day

1393
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,760
wow

1394
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:03,759
what a huge difference

1395
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,319
and with electric lights you gotta have

1396
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:09,359
a lot of electric lights even to get to

1397
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:11,838
30 moles per meter squared per day 30

1398
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:12,880
will grow fine um but we got a lot of

1399
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:14,880
evidence

1400
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,318
you can still keep increasing yield up

1401
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,680
to 60

1402
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:20,000
moles per meter square per day and

1403
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:22,399
that's a lot of lights to get to 60.

1404
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,400
that's the concept of daily light

1405
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,760
integral and it's worth it to become

1406
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:30,160
familiar with it i because of this

1407
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:33,040
my company the company i started apogee

1408
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:35,838
instruments makes a series of products

1409
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:38,480
to measure daily light integral it just

1410
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:40,880
sits there and adds up all the photons

1411
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,800
and at the end of the day it gives you a

1412
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,880
a number for this and

1413
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,800
you got to have a microprocessor in the

1414
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,800
sensor to do that and

1415
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,559
we haven't had many instruments to do

1416
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,160
that in the past but

1417
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,920
but um

1418
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:55,838
oh i don't know if you typed in daily

1419
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,960
light integral and apogee you would find

1420
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:58,239
these uh

1421
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,079
sensors

1422
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,919
and there are also calculators online if

1423
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,839
somebody's new to dli you could type in

1424
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,318
dli calculator and just kind of get an

1425
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:07,838
idea type in what the ppfd is and then

1426
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:09,199
the number of light hours and press the

1427
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:11,519
calculate button it will tell you what

1428
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:14,719
your dli is so it makes things pretty

1429
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:16,239
easy having a calculator yes good good

1430
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:17,919
point

1431
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:20,639
now i believe you did a study about

1432
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,880
replicating the natural sunlight by

1433
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:24,960
starting the lights on a lower setting

1434
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,440
then increasing the output over a period

1435
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,559
of an hour or two and then dipping the

1436
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,559
light gradually before lights off versus

1437
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,440
just hitting the plants with full power

1438
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,599
lights

1439
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,838
all the way until the lights turn off if

1440
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:40,240
i remember correctly the plants took the

1441
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:41,920
full power just fine there wasn't really

1442
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:42,799
a benefit to gradually increasing the

1443
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,480
light

1444
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,519
is that correct can you talk to us about

1445
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,199
that study

1446
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:49,759
yeah that actually

1447
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:52,078
was a study by a colleague

1448
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,240
at the university of illinois don geiger

1449
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:56,800
he wasn't working with

1450
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:58,159
medical hemp he was he was working with

1451
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,440
other crops

1452
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:00,719
um

1453
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,559
and

1454
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:05,118
it it's you're right he he looked at

1455
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:07,760
ramping it up slowly and ramping it down

1456
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:10,079
slowly but then and i have talked about

1457
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,920
his study i've met him and we've even he

1458
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,280
and i have discussed his research at

1459
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,358
length

1460
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,319
but what we have done

1461
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:19,440
is

1462
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:22,318
measure photosynthesis

1463
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,079
one minute to the next

1464
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:25,920
and we take these plants that are

1465
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,960
sleeping in the dark

1466
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:31,599
and boom we turn on the lights

1467
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,280
and they get the full brightness in

1468
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,838
under a minute

1469
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,359
how fast are the plants wake up and get

1470
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:38,719
going

1471
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:40,239
and it takes

1472
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:42,078
several minutes

1473
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:45,439
for them to get going

1474
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:47,519
but it doesn't take several hours

1475
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,000
and which is an interesting analogy to

1476
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:52,719
people you know you think i like to get

1477
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,760
up and have coffee i got my slippers on

1478
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:58,159
you know don't ask me to do hard math

1479
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,920
right after i wake up i gotta ramp up

1480
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:03,118
into the day

1481
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:05,920
but at least plants we have studied

1482
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:08,640
boy can they ramp up fast and in fact

1483
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,480
their most productive period of the day

1484
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:12,400
is the first couple hours after the

1485
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,719
lights come on

1486
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,838
so we we haven't we don't have any

1487
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:16,639
evidence

1488
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:20,159
that

1489
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:22,318
it helps to ramp the light up slowly

1490
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:24,798
and in fact you lose the opportunity to

1491
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:26,480
give a lot of photons to the plants

1492
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:27,280
if you just turn them on and leave them

1493
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,838
on

1494
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,559
that's the results in the highest daily

1495
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:33,599
like integral for the plants

1496
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,280
so

1497
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:37,119
that's what we recommend

1498
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,480
we we don't have any evidence that a

1499
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:41,599
slow ramping up or a slow decrease is

1500
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,679
helpful

1501
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:45,359
that's good to know for sure

1502
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:47,039
i got kind of a loaded question for you

1503
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:48,558
next answer it however you'd like but

1504
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:50,719
talk to us about your findings in

1505
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:53,040
regards to light spectrum and how it

1506
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:54,798
impacts plant growth there's two parts

1507
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:57,440
of that one is the effects of light

1508
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:59,838
spectrum on photosynthesis

1509
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:03,760
and one the effects of light spectrum on

1510
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:07,279
plant shape or development

1511
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,640
we know a lot about photosynthesis

1512
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,400
and

1513
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:13,118
within the last couple years we've had a

1514
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,760
huge breakthrough on that in in my

1515
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:18,318
laboratory and in my colleague

1516
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:21,280
mark van nersel's lab and and shu yang

1517
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:23,920
zhan who's now at texas a m

1518
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,960
we have very clearly found that far red

1519
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:30,079
photons cause photosynthesis

1520
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,920
so now we're defining a new metric for

1521
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:34,400
for light for plants

1522
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:37,440
and it's called e par

1523
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,639
lowercase e and then par

1524
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:43,679
and

1525
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:46,639
that means 400 to 750 nanometers

1526
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:50,159
that range is photosynthetic the old way

1527
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:53,598
was 400 to 700

1528
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:55,598
but now we have 400 to 750

1529
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:57,920
and of course

1530
00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:00,480
companies are now making epar meters

1531
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,720
apogee makes an epar meter to include

1532
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,280
the far red photons

1533
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:07,118
in that range

1534
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,960
the red photons

1535
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:13,358
and the and are better than blue

1536
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,599
and about 30 percent better because blue

1537
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:16,480
photons get absorbed

1538
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,400
by

1539
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,639
pigments that aren't photosynthetic

1540
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,559
anthocyanins carotenoids they just they

1541
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:24,159
get absorbed and they don't cause

1542
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,200
photosynthesis

1543
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:28,399
um

1544
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:30,639
but so so that leads to colors of light

1545
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,760
for photosynthesis we should include far

1546
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:34,960
red

1547
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:38,559
but the bigger effects of light color

1548
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:40,639
and light quality are on plant shape

1549
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,798
and they're on the synthesis of

1550
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:45,039
secondary metabolites

1551
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:45,039
um

1552
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,599
if blue light

1553
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:51,838
shrinks plants

1554
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:54,400
and if you want small compact plants you

1555
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:57,199
want to give them more blue light and

1556
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,440
and this is why years ago we used to

1557
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:01,199
give plants in veg

1558
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,200
light from metal halide lights because

1559
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:05,439
it had a lot of blue light and the

1560
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:07,759
plants were nice and compact

1561
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:10,159
and then we would switch to the more

1562
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,480
efficient high pressure sodium lights

1563
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:13,598
during flowering because they could get

1564
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,639
more light

1565
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:19,359
now this is now leds come along

1566
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:21,039
and most led fixtures have low amounts

1567
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:23,838
of blue light

1568
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:27,119
because it's not as photosynthetic

1569
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:28,000
the blue leds are not as efficient

1570
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,000
and

1571
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,880
um and that's fine that plants don't

1572
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,280
need that much blue light to for

1573
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,838
optimal photosynthesis

1574
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,839
but

1575
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:45,039
the amount of blue light it controls

1576
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:47,200
stem elongation and leaf expansion

1577
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:49,679
and and we're doing a lot of studies now

1578
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:53,279
in the minimum amount of blue light

1579
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:55,358
to have it have a normal looking plant

1580
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,920
i mean you know down one and two percent

1581
00:58:55,358 --> 00:59:02,279
blue photons

1582
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:06,400
if we give the plants far red photons it

1583
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:08,319
significantly increases stem elongation

1584
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,480
so we can shape the plants and normally

1585
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:13,599
we don't want big tall plants we want

1586
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,679
smaller compact plants but not always if

1587
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:18,640
we want air flow through the canopy we

1588
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:21,519
want taller plants but you can really

1589
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:23,279
control plant height with

1590
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:25,679
light spectra

1591
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,280
and you can even control how dense the

1592
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:29,519
flower buds are

1593
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,359
if you want to tight flower buds you

1594
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:33,440
want more blue light if you want it to

1595
00:59:31,358 --> 00:59:36,000
be elongated more

1596
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,599
you would give it more far red photons

1597
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,838
and then the flower bud gets a little

1598
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:42,160
bit more spaced out

1599
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:43,759
and then now what's consumer preference

1600
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:44,558
you know what's the shape of the flower

1601
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,280
that

1602
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:49,119
people want to buy we can control that

1603
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,920
with light spectra this is a quick

1604
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,920
summary of a lot of stuff but

1605
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,680
for sure the point that interested me

1606
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,240
the most was i wasn't aware that the

1607
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:59,838
blue light how it impacts the density of

1608
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:01,358
the bud yeah i was not aware of that

1609
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:03,679
that's new information to me that that's

1610
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:05,920
really good to know now how about uv

1611
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:07,279
light what's your findings there people

1612
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,798
have said

1613
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,519
uv light

1614
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:12,318
will increase cannabinoids

1615
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:14,719
and

1616
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:18,639
people i mean many growers

1617
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:20,879
and they often cite a paper by

1618
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:23,920
a scientist the first author is a guy

1619
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:28,400
named leiden l-y-d-o-n

1620
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:29,838
this was a paper about 30 years ago

1621
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,280
on the effects of blue light and

1622
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:34,480
cannabinoids

1623
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:36,720
this was not for medical hemp this was

1624
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,719
for

1625
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,400
photo protection from uv light from the

1626
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,040
sun

1627
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,880
and leiden only studied leaves and how

1628
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:47,358
much the leaves made and they made very

1629
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:50,318
low levels of cannabinoids his data were

1630
01:00:47,358 --> 01:00:53,358
all in a few tenths of a percent in the

1631
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:55,279
leaves he only studied vegetative plants

1632
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:58,000
no flowers

1633
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:00,319
one cultivar there was no effect of uv

1634
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,960
light on cannabinoids but in the other

1635
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:05,519
cultivar there was an effect

1636
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:08,159
and he said in his paper

1637
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:09,119
the effect of uv light on cannabinoids

1638
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:11,358
is

1639
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:13,599
equivocal

1640
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:15,119
now let's you look up the word equivocal

1641
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,480
and it means

1642
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:19,280
uncertain

1643
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:21,519
and unknown we don't know

1644
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,680
but everybody cites leiden's paper as

1645
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:25,759
proof that uv light increases

1646
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:28,399
cannabinoids and that's not what he

1647
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:30,720
found at all in his paper and i would

1648
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,160
invite everybody to study his paper and

1649
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:33,439
read it carefully

1650
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:34,480
so

1651
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,119
we

1652
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:40,719
have studied uv light and cannabinoids

1653
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:43,440
and you both uvb and uva

1654
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:47,358
and we've never been able to show a

1655
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:49,280
beneficial effect of uv on cannabinoids

1656
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:51,119
at least for the cultivars we have

1657
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,960
studied

1658
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:54,640
now that we have our colleagues at the

1659
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:57,199
university of guelph

1660
01:01:54,639 --> 01:01:59,199
also published a paper on this

1661
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:02,159
independent of our research and they

1662
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:04,838
found the same thing as we did so

1663
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:07,598
another research laboratory at another

1664
01:02:04,838 --> 01:02:09,759
university finds the same thing as we do

1665
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:12,000
now it doesn't mean we can't find

1666
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:15,280
exactly the right dose and the right

1667
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,358
wavelength that might be beneficial

1668
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:19,599
but it is not going to be easy because

1669
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:21,038
we've tried multiple doses and multiple

1670
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:24,000
wavelengths

1671
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:26,319
and we've just never seen a benefit

1672
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,719
in spite of the fact that uv should be

1673
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:30,880
triggering these photo protective

1674
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:33,038
pigments in theory we think we should

1675
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,720
see an effect in practice we've never

1676
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:36,720
been able to show it

1677
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:38,480
wow lots of good information there for

1678
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:40,239
sure

1679
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,079
one last thing i wanted to talk about i

1680
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:43,838
know probably coming up close on time

1681
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:46,480
here but one thing i wanted to bring up

1682
01:02:43,838 --> 01:02:48,558
was talking about silica you've done a

1683
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,240
ton of research when it comes to silica

1684
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:51,440
i mean i've watched your presentation

1685
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:53,358
that you had there's a lot of

1686
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,519
information that you mentioned in there

1687
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:58,000
that's not really mentioned to the

1688
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:59,920
general public from my understanding can

1689
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,519
you talk to us about some of your main

1690
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,639
findings with the research you've done

1691
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:06,719
with silica yes silica is not essential

1692
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:09,199
but that doesn't matter it's

1693
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:12,558
very highly beneficial

1694
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:14,879
and silica is what glass is made out of

1695
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:16,960
silicon dioxide

1696
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,599
plants take up silica they get lots of

1697
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:21,119
silica in the field soils it's a natural

1698
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:23,280
element

1699
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:25,680
and it goes into cell walls and it makes

1700
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,200
them tougher makes it it's like glass in

1701
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:29,440
the cell walls

1702
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:32,480
and one of the big advantages that makes

1703
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:35,119
them more resistant to diseases

1704
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,280
particularly powdery mildew

1705
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:39,519
we can we give our plants real high

1706
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:43,039
silica and we almost have eliminated

1707
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:45,038
powdery mildew because of that

1708
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:48,079
there's lots of evidence that helps uh

1709
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:49,200
plants become more resistant to insects

1710
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:53,039
as well

1711
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:55,038
particularly the chewing insects um

1712
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:56,720
so the challenge is how to how to get it

1713
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:59,280
in the root zone because it's not a very

1714
01:03:56,719 --> 01:04:01,759
soluble element

1715
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:04,480
and we've been working on

1716
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:07,520
papers on how to increase it in liquid

1717
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:10,000
feed with a separate injector

1718
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:12,719
and then also compounds that we can add

1719
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:15,519
to media to elevate

1720
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:17,679
silica in the media

1721
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:19,358
so but it's a but it's a very beneficial

1722
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:21,759
element

1723
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:23,440
especially because the trichomes are

1724
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,440
almost pure silica

1725
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,599
and we want a lot of trichomes and we

1726
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,358
want them tough we want we don't want

1727
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,280
them to fall off we don't want them to

1728
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:34,400
be fragile

1729
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,359
and and silica helps with that

1730
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,680
and

1731
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:39,679
in soilless media

1732
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:41,838
no silica

1733
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:44,639
that people add soil to get silica well

1734
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:46,480
you can add it from silica fertilizers

1735
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:48,239
too but so

1736
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,079
here we're moving to a thing with no

1737
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:51,279
silica just at a time when we should be

1738
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:53,280
adding more

1739
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,880
so it's a silica is a very

1740
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,720
underappreciated

1741
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:00,000
beneficial element

1742
01:04:56,719 --> 01:05:01,679
particularly for medical hemp i'm glad

1743
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,440
that you brought up the fact that it

1744
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:04,960
strengthens the trichome because that's

1745
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,880
that's really one of the main things

1746
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,639
that nobody talks about right that's

1747
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,160
impact on the actual trichomes and

1748
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:11,358
that's what we're aiming for you know

1749
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:13,598
when we're growing these medicinal

1750
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:15,759
plants so great stuff there i definitely

1751
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:18,880
recommend that everybody have silica in

1752
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:20,640
their feeding routine right so

1753
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,720
what new science has come out in the

1754
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:24,558
past year or so regarding these

1755
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:26,480
medicinal plants

1756
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:28,240
well i think some of our

1757
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,960
threshold work

1758
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:32,719
recent work and also the the near future

1759
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:37,519
is going to be the interaction between

1760
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:41,439
genetics and environment um new

1761
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:43,199
strains new cultivars new chemotypes and

1762
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:46,000
then

1763
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:47,439
new environments to optimize production

1764
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,039
and when you think of the history of

1765
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,200
agriculture

1766
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:53,520
half of our advances are genetics and

1767
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:56,000
half of our advances are environment

1768
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:58,798
better fertilization better watering but

1769
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,559
better genetics too and that same thing

1770
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:01,880
is going to happen with uh

1771
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,480
medical hemp

1772
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:07,599
particularly as we get

1773
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:09,358
professional plant breeders involved

1774
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:12,720
that can do use

1775
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:12,719
molecular techniques

1776
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:19,760
here's an example

1777
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:21,519
we all know that medical hemp very labor

1778
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,000
intensive to harvest

1779
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:27,038
you know you're trimming sugar leaves

1780
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,559
it's just a lot of labor to get it just

1781
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:31,760
right

1782
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:34,079
in field agriculture we have bred plants

1783
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:36,799
to be easier to harvest

1784
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,880
tomatoes i mean we've bred plants to the

1785
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:41,759
right at harvest the tomatoes break off

1786
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:44,000
the plant real easily

1787
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,000
we could breed medical hemp to make it

1788
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,519
easier to harvest there's there's one

1789
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
example of

1790
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:53,119
of many we could breed medical hemp so

1791
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,358
it can take a 16 hour photo period we

1792
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:58,000
can give it more light

1793
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:59,519
and get higher yields

1794
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,719
all of these things that i think they're

1795
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:02,239
in the near

1796
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:03,919
future

1797
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:06,159
uh

1798
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,000
you but you asked about the past in the

1799
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:11,440
last couple years

1800
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,838
the one big project of ours is um

1801
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:16,318
phosphorus

1802
01:07:13,838 --> 01:07:18,719
phosphorus very interesting the the

1803
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:22,000
unfertilized flowers suck up a lot of

1804
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:24,318
phosphorus it doesn't it doesn't uh

1805
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,400
do anything it's it's just

1806
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:28,480
excess phosphorous

1807
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,680
but they cannibalize phosphorus out of

1808
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,760
the leaves

1809
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:34,960
and for that reason medical hemp

1810
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,319
benefits from more phosphorus than most

1811
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,358
other crops

1812
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:39,440
but

1813
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:41,838
not ten times as much

1814
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:44,240
maybe two times as much so we're trying

1815
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:46,639
to get people to back off to precision

1816
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:49,118
fertilized with phosphorus adequate

1817
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:50,798
phosphorus but not excessive for all the

1818
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:52,559
reasons we talked about in the beginning

1819
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:54,880
it's a it's a bad environmental

1820
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:57,280
pollutant and i'm waiting for companies

1821
01:07:54,880 --> 01:08:00,079
to say our medical hemp sustainably

1822
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,519
grown we don't over over fertilize with

1823
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:03,599
phosphorus

1824
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:05,599
but we got to give them the data so they

1825
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:08,240
know how much is enough

1826
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:10,798
so they so they don't suffer from yield

1827
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:12,959
from inadequate phosphorus

1828
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:15,038
gotcha gotcha so a lot of good stuff

1829
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:16,640
there so i could go on and on and on and

1830
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:18,239
ask you more and more questions but

1831
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,239
we're going to wrap things up here tell

1832
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:21,759
us how can the listeners find you and

1833
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:24,879
what do you have upcoming in the future

1834
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:26,319
we have have lots of videos on the

1835
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,759
internet

1836
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,880
we have

1837
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:30,640
taught

1838
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,119
as you know because you're in the class

1839
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:36,798
but this is a

1840
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:39,358
university level course online and we

1841
01:08:36,798 --> 01:08:41,359
it's it's about 50 lectures of all the

1842
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:42,960
stuff i've been talking about so just

1843
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:43,838
expanded

1844
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,158
now

1845
01:08:43,838 --> 01:08:48,079
the first group of students in that

1846
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:50,838
class is is

1847
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:52,479
it's the class is now closed for uh

1848
01:08:50,838 --> 01:08:54,158
registration

1849
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:56,479
but we are already because of an

1850
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:58,000
overwhelming response we're already

1851
01:08:56,479 --> 01:09:00,479
preparing

1852
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,359
a second edition of the course

1853
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:03,599
um

1854
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:04,640
and it may be a more advanced edition of

1855
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,440
the course

1856
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,719
but it's done with two colleagues um

1857
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:11,198
and uh

1858
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:12,158
recorded here in our recording studio so

1859
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:13,838
the

1860
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:15,679
quality is high and we're really

1861
01:09:13,838 --> 01:09:17,759
gratified with all the people all the

1862
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:19,600
good comments on that

1863
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:21,679
um

1864
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:24,400
so that's that's uh

1865
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:27,440
i can say watch for more videos

1866
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:28,719
um i do i do videos through apogee

1867
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:31,519
instruments

1868
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:33,359
um i do some through the university but

1869
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:36,080
those videos i think have been more

1870
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:38,319
effective than writing well

1871
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:40,318
for the for the grower audience they're

1872
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:41,679
a lot more effective than scientific

1873
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:43,440
papers

1874
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:45,759
because those papers can get pretty

1875
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:45,759
dense

1876
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,880
you need to have what's just tell me the

1877
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:52,238
bottom line from all this research

1878
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,560
makes sense

1879
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:57,039
well i will leave a link to dr bruce
