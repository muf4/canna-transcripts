81
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:55,679

82
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,360
get you on here I'm excited about

83
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,400
today's conversation because of your

84
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,640
background your experience

85
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,599
you have experience in commercial

86
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:06,679
facilities you have experience in larger

87
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:08,839
operations experience homeg growing as

88
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,760
well not just medicinal plants but

89
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,000
vegetables as well and I think you're

90
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,000
going to be able to bring a lot of value

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,199
to today's conversation because it has

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,479
to do with kind of making things more

93
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:21,439
efficient in the garden and when you're

94
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:22,679
working in a commercial operation and

95
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,680
you can correct me if I'm wrong I know

96
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,000
every commercial operation is kind of

97
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,439
different right but efficiency is kind

98
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,560
of a big point you know they don't want

99
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:33,959
to just pay workers for standing around

100
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,360
they want processes to be done in an

101
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,840
efficient manner and reduce the labor

102
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,360
hours the labor cost that they spend so

103
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,280
there are a lot of tips a lot of various

104
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,200
things that they do in commercial

105
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,799
facilities that I think save time and

106
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,958
also a lot of that stuff can be

107
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:49,879
translated to the hom grower as well and

108
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,438
a lot of the audience is hom Growers

109
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:52,639

111

outdoor all aspects but for the most

112
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,000

you know his pops was dealing with some

135
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:51,198
glaucoma and he needed to consume just

136
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,360
about every day to to be able to

137
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,800
function no normally and um of course I

138
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,199
was like yeah you I can help him out try

139
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,759
to find him some stuff and um once I

140
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,038
started doing that you know me and

141
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,720
really got to know each other a little

142
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,319
more even though I already knew him you

143
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,960
I would sit down with them for maybe

144
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,360
half an hour and then half an hour

145
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:10,038
turned into an hour then two hours you

146
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,160
know we we actually started hanging out

147
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:14,759
almost no three four times a week and um

148
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,600
one day he was like yeah man I just want

149
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:20,639
to um kind of showed me that um how the

150
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,000
glaucoma kind of affects him and um he

151
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,160
was like you know it's not really

152
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,759
painful or anything but it's just like

153
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,919
you know you get pressure like in the

154
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,840
eye like um some valve like attached to

155
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:32,560
the retina it kind of just builds up

156
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:34,839
pressure and it just causes them not be

157
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,879
able to see and um sometimes it just

158
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:39,560
made him cry a lot as well just for no

159
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:42,360
reason like just crying and um one day

160
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,000
he consumed in front of me and um he

161
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,319
showed me that you know once he consumed

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,680
like all that really came to a halt and

163
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,720
um that was the first time that I've

164
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,800
actually seen the power of the plant and

165
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,120
I it was pretty remarkable and um not

166
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,918
long after that um he asked me about

167
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,478
helping him do a garden in the backyard

168
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:01,639
and um of course I was like yes and um

169
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:03,240
he gave me a book I don't really

170
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,478
remember the name of the book but I know

171
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,079
in the book you know it told us

172
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:10,000
everything about gardening from U summer

173
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,439
crops the cold weather crops um how to

174
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,519
use the rotor taer to dig your plot uh

175
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:18,199
build a bed the rais bed build your soil

176
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,598
uh compost compost teas it was just

177
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,400
everything in there and um yeah we set

178
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:23,918
out know we set everything up did

179
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,679
everything that summer it was probably

180
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:29,159
like 2011 we did that and um we got some

181
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,879
really nice fruits and vegetables when

182
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,120
you see season was over and um the next

183
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,439
year um I'm up here in Massachusetts so

184
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,360
the next year was 2012 and they actually

185
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,879
um actually passed medical here so I

186
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,240
just had an idea like maybe we should

187
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:44,560
put some plants in the yard like I

188
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,560
wasn't really trying to like watch his

189
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,160
pockets but know I realized that he was

190
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,800
spending you know a significant amount

191
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,919
of money you know to get his medicine

192
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,240
and I just thought you know it would be

193
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,680
a great idea if we can just do it

194
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,319
ourselves and um when I asked him about

195
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,759
it I mean he lit up like a Christmas

196
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:01,280
tree and he was like so excited that

197
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,598
know I was interested in maybe doing

198
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,239
that and then he looked at me for like

199
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:06,759
maybe two minutes just not saying

200
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,160
anything he was like you know what you

201
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:12,080
know we cannot tell my wife about this

202
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,080
and I was like hey no no problem man and

203
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,598
then um you know I knew a guy who was

204
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,318
actually already kind of doing it at

205
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:20,719
home so um I went by to check out what

206
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,560
he was doing and he was actually uh

207
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,240
growing organically and he was telling

208
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,280
me like um he had everything already in

209
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,918
the soil so he was just feeding actually

210
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,000
just plain water through this whole

211
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:31,839
cycle

212
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,720
and um when he said that it just kind of

213
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,478
dawned on me like you know we just we

214
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,919
just built our own SoDo for garden and

215
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:39,120
vegetables I mean maybe I can just do

216
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:41,120
the same thing you know and um he

217
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,519
actually gave me my first two know set

218
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,240
of seeds uh it was some Cali Cali Kush

219
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:48,318
and um that's what I did you know I used

220
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,400
some of the garden soil and we put the

221
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,000
put the seeds in there and everything

222
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,878
was going real smooth and then all of a

223
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,918
sudden you know we ran into like the

224
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,520
malnutrition and like the efficiencies

225
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:00,198
kicked in and at the time we didn't

226
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,478
really know what any of that was we were

227
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,680
just like we don't know what's going on

228
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,199
so we just started doing some research

229
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,199
uh everyone was saying um you know you

230
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:11,560
got to go to your local local grow store

231
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,598
and you know get some stuff there so I

232
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,280
looked it up the local the the closest

233
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,120
store to me was in Rhode Island so that

234
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:20,519
was about 35 minutes away like you know

235
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,038
what I still went and when I went down

236
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,758
and in the store was the store was

237
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:25,399
phenomenal I've never seen the store

238
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,000
like that before so I was kind of like

239
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:29,959
wow and um actually found myself going

240
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,519
down there multiple times week sometimes

241
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:33,079
not even buying anything I just wanted

242
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,679
to go there and just pick the brain of

243
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,399
people who work there and um when I was

244
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,838
there the first time I noticed that some

245
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,278
of the the nutrients on the shelves was

246
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,519
uh some of the stuff that we had in the

247
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,958
garage already so I'm thinking okay well

248
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,399
I'm going go back to the garage and know

249
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,239
mix some stuff up so I'm in the garage

250
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,919
with a no five gallon bucket and I'm

251
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,720
throwing bone meal I'm throwing blood

252
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:55,399
mail in there and kelp alala I had a

253
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,600
little bottle of like seed weed juice

254
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:59,200
I'm squirting that in there and I just

255
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,920
Stir It Up mix it up and then I just

256
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,200
throw it on the p on the plants and I'm

257
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:04,519
just like all right I think we're going

258
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,640
to be in good shape now and man I'm

259
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:08,200
telling you like maybe 2 3 days later

260
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,879
that those plants look like fried

261
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,519
chicken they were so burnt up I didn't

262
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,559
know what was going on we were like did

263
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,560
did the sun do this we did we got some

264
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,319
past or something attacking it like we

265
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,278
didn't have no idea what was going on so

266
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,959
I'm back at the gr store asking the guys

267
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:24,720
you know know plants look a little weird

268
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,919
now and then they're like well did you

269
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,440
pH it uh did you get your EC right and

270
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,879
I'm like I don't know I don't know any

271
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,519
of that means

272
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:32,600
you know and then like yeah you got to

273
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,480
you know you got to make sure you're

274
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,360
doing the proper feedings and stuff and

275
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,800
I'm like ah okay so we eventually fixed

276
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:44,039
all that but um the end result was not

277
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,679
great um we were kind of bummed out and

278
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:47,159
um I was kind of like you know I think I

279
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:49,078
think I might want to try to do this you

280
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:50,759
know year round and um he was like you

281
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:52,919
know it's not a bad idea you know I can

282
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,000
help you invest in getting something and

283
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:57,879
so I went back to the store and I

284
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,919
actually picked up a uh was the hydro

285
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:04,320
Farm uh like fixture I picked up two uh

286
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:06,039
CFLs uh one for veg one for Bloom you

287
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,000
know took it home put it in the closet

288
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:09,879
you know I put the aluminum foil all

289
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,200
around the closet to get some reflection

290
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:14,639
going um made it real nice and then um

291
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,600
yeah I just started started growing

292
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,319
right in the closet at home and then um

293
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,440
I was reading looking at some videos on

294
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,000
YouTube people were saying you know more

295
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,600
lights better so you know I went back to

296
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,679
the store picked up some uh 4ot

297
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,278
t5s uh put put those in there and then

298
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,399
um I don't know if you remember this

299
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,078
light but there was a light back then um

300
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,000
it was called the castle kind of looked

301
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:36,638
like a a bigger version of a flashlight

302
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,839
it was like one of the one of like the

303
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,159
first LEDs they really marketed in the

304
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,600
in the grow magazines so I picked up one

305
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:44,958
of those and know I had all different

306
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,480
type of light spectrums going and know

307
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,239
that's pretty much how I got started you

308
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,320
know from the closet you know I felt

309
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,120
like it wasn't big enough ended up

310
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,240
copping a 4x4 and all the all the extras

311
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,399
that come with it and I kind of just

312
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,759
been doing it ever since man that's

313
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:00,278
awesome that's really really cool so you

314
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,600
started out with the vegetables I mean

315
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:04,078
before we started recording you listed

316
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,079
off a dozen vegetables that you've been

317
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,719
growing over the years then you went to

318
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:10,319
a closet grow now you're actually you

319
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,959
went actually into commercial facilities

320
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,560
too right I think you mentioned to me

321
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:15,078
behind the scenes that you there's a

322
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:17,319
couple different operations I'm looking

323
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:19,399
at your Instagram I see a greenhouse and

324
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,000
then I see an indoor operation how'd you

325
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:25,360
get into that oh that well well I'm up

326

here in Massachusetts so around 2015 you

327
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,200
know they really started to try to open

328
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,919
these places up and um I really wanted

329
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,480
to get a job doing it cuz I was doing it

330
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:34,479
at home you know people were saying that

331
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,680
you know you know I was doing a good job

332
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,159
you know I didn't know if I was doing a

333
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,199
good job but they said I was doing a

334
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:41,639
good job you know I always kept a

335
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,519
portfolio and I just kept going over to

336
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,519
the dispensary and I was like no can I

337
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,039
get a job can I get a job and they like

338
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,440
well the guy to talk to was never there

339
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:53,399
and then one day he was finally there

340
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,480
and um I showed him my portfolio he's

341
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,159
like oh you're the one that's been

342
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,000
coming around here for a job huh and I

343
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,199
was like yeah he said well your pictures

344
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,278
look nice so I think I'm going to hire

345
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,639
you and I was like oh nice you know so

346
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:05,519
that was actually my first gig um back

347
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,959
in

348
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,839
2015 and then um the greenhouse work

349
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:12,000
that came later on um that's actually

350
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,320
down in Oklahoma um I got some family

351
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,039
down there um around 2018 my brother

352
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,720
called me he was like you know I think

353
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,240
Oklahoma's about to get the green light

354
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,680
down here so he wanted to learn so I've

355
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,000
been so I was trying to teach him like

356
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:27,078
over over Skype over video know he

357
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,278
called me every day I sent him some

358
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:32,359
seeds try to get him going to show him

359
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:35,720
the ropes and um eventually you know he

360
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,519
took what he learned from me um and know

361
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,079
he showed his business partner and then

362
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,240
they got more partners and they ended up

363
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:44,399
opening quite a few things down here in

364
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,839
Oklahoma yeah I've heard Oklahoma is

365
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,759
pretty crazy there's a lot it's more

366
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:51,199
freedom than some of the other states

367
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:53,759
out there it's pretty wild west down

368
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:55,000
there pretty wild west but right now I

369
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,879
hear they're trying to clean it up a

370
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,360
little bit right now so that's a good

371
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:01,399
thing to be honest yeah and then kind of

372
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,800
to bring it to where you are now you had

373
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,600
mentioned behind the scenes that you're

374
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,159
doing consulting now so you've kind of

375
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,240
stepped away from the commercial

376
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:09,278
facilities still doing the hom grow and

377
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,198
stuff like that but you're doing

378
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,078
consulting how does that working out for

379
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:15,439
you it's been working out pretty good

380
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:17,719
you know um a lot of people like I

381
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,600
started this back in maybe

382
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,399
2016 um before I even did the before I

383
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,720
had dubis sou I actually called myself

384
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:28,039
natural remedy um because um back in

385
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,560
2012 when I was doing the closet grow

386
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:31,759
and stuff I actually

387
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,439
um his name's Clarence Clarence actually

388
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,639
became my I became Clarence caregiver

389
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,279
you know we got all licensed and

390
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,480
approved for it so I became his

391
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:41,198
caregiver I was doing everything for him

392
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,240
mainly and

393
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:48,159
um and then um later on down like 2015

394
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,399
um working in dispensaries and then like

395
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,159
just it just dawned on me that I wanted

396
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:54,078
to do something more like uh on my own

397
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,278
so um there was a lot of people at the

398
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,239
time that wanted to learn how to do this

399
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:00,039
because it was it was so new around here

400
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,680
everybody wanted to try to get the hands

401
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:04,278
in on the industry so I figured you know

402
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:07,078
I can start doing this helping people

403
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:09,799
out um start them off slow uh show them

404
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:11,319
how to do it from from beginning to end

405
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:12,799
and it worked out pretty well and a lot

406
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,720
of people really wanted to get into it

407
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,439
so I was willing to help them out

408
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,240
awesome so I imagine you have clients

409
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,519
that are kind of looking to get the

410
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,320
information that you're about to speak

411
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,159
today which is making things more

412
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,560
efficient growing a large number of

413
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:27,240
plants and being efficient with it and

414
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,239
uh let's transition to that right now

415
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,879
and I think I want to start with the

416
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,639
beginning really germinating planting

417
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:36,879
seeds and cutting clones right how do

418
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,639
you go about those things in an

419
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:42,198
efficient manner um I usually like to

420
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:44,959
start my seeds either in the Solo cup or

421
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:46,559
the paper towel method and um you I let

422
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:49,399
those sit in the cup until you know the

423
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:52,439
tab rout pops out uh paper towel method

424
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:54,799
um anywhere between 48 72 hours you

425
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,399
might get the tab rot popping out and

426
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,039
then uh shortly after that I kind of

427
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,519
just transition that into a maybe a a 4

428
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,360
in pot and that's going to be its home

429
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,360
for a several weeks I mean I don't

430
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,639
really uh move it out of that pot until

431
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,278
I get a really good root structure built

432
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:14,120
um maybe the plant get like six to seven

433
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:16,360
Ines tall um but before I even talk

434
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,919
about the the plants getting tall like

435
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,919
the way you go about it uh way I go

436
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:22,958
about it is like um before I even plant

437
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,919
the seed I like to um put the soil in um

438
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,319
I like to use like a like a Mis I don't

439
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:28,039
really go heavy with the water and I

440
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,160
like to mist the top of the soil you

441
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:33,799
know poke your hole you know put the tap

442
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:36,039
rout down um actually put plastic bags

443
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:37,559
over the cup or over the over the pot

444
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:39,480
just to keep the humidity up because you

445
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:42,119
know you need to get the seed to and

446
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,639
like at least 90% humidity to get the

447
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,039
get the seed to break the seed coat so

448
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,839
that's what I do with that and then I

449
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:49,879
usually let it stay in that pot for at

450
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,240
least probably three three and a half

451
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:54,799
weeks maybe four weeks before I

452
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:58,159
transplant to the final pot um my final

453
00:15:54,799 --> 00:16:00,958
pots are usually um either one gallon or

454
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:03,719
two gall I just like those more cuz uh

455
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:06,719
like more control of your watering uh

456
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,278
that's uh it's kind of like um easy or

457
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,839
not to overw water your plants with a

458
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:12,559
smaller pot um I know a lot of people

459
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:16,199
have trouble starting off because they

460
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:18,078
usually know water too much and so I

461
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:19,958
think small parts are are way to go for

462
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,638
when you start off got it now you

463
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:24,599
mentioned the paper towel method and I

464
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:26,560
want to talk about that for a minute I

465
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,920
used to use the paper towel method quite

466
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,239
a bit and very common method I mean

467
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:32,000
that's one of the first things you learn

468
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,680
is to put the soak the seeds in the

469
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,318
paper towel then once you see it cracked

470
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,039
open you plant it from there there's a

471
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:40,278
lot of people who just go straight into

472
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:42,439
the soil and they say hey more efficient

473
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:45,519
easier skip the paper toile me just go

474
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,480
right into soil now when you're growing

475
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,639
hundreds of plants at once germinating

476
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,720
hundreds of seeds at once it's more

477
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,079
efficient to put into a paper towel see

478
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,319
which ones crack open and then plant

479
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:59,078
those ones versus planting a 100

480
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:00,679
different seeds into grow pots and then

481
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:03,159
finding out which ones pop and which

482
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:05,318
ones don't so like I thought that was a

483
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:07,798
a really good efficient tip that I heard

484
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:09,558
from somebody when uh talking about just

485
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:11,558
planting in the soil and saving time and

486
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:13,918
so on and so forth somebody replied and

487
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:16,199
they like no no not for me I plant 100

488
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,880
seeds at a time and paper towel is much

489
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,279
more efficient for me so thought that

490
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,679
was a great point to bring bring up

491
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,279
since we are talking about efficiency

492
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,839
here is uh yeah the paper towel method

493
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,918
can be more efficient if you're growing

494
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:29,119
a large number of seeds then you'll see

495
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,640
which ones are good which ones are not

496
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:35,719
you're not wasting time there so y now

497
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,799
how about mixing soil you talked about

498
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,440
you're growing organic what's in your

499
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:42,839
soil mix and how do you go about the

500
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,759
mixing process well I never really uh

501
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:46,639
never really grown an organic for like

502
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:49,119
uh for medicinal plants I mean I've

503
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,799
tried it once with um I heard a lot of

504
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:53,639
good things with um what's the name of

505
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:55,279
that company COA main Costa main is

506
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,880
supposed to have really good uh like

507
00:17:55,279 --> 00:18:01,038
super soil and um the one time I really

508
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:04,200
wanted to try it I got a really bad bag

509
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:06,400
um so many bugs in it it was horrible

510
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,798
horrible experience with it but as far

511
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,480
as the garden goes um when we built the

512
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:15,519
bed for the garden uh we just used like

513
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:18,120
a bone meal blood Mill a fala male uh we

514
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,158
had Kel mail we actually used uh

515
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:23,879
European nightcrawlers instead of using

516
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:25,280
worm castings uh veralite perite uh you

517
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,960
know mix it all together you know you

518
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:30,240
throw it in the bed um let the bed cook

519
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,038
cuz you know all that stuff you put in

520
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,319
there is really hot so we let the bed

521
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:36,759
cook for like maybe 2 3 weeks before we

522
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,879
actually put plants in it and that's how

523
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:40,359
we went about building our soil and then

524
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,960
you said for container size you're

525
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:45,000
starting out in Solo cups have those in

526
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,360
there for about 3 weeks then you're

527
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,880
transitioning you're doing one

528
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:50,119
transplant correct me if I'm wrong to

529
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,559
your final container which is one or two

530
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:54,719
gallon containers then the question I

531
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,558
had was using organic in such a small

532
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,200
pot but you just corrected me that

533
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:00,119
you're actually using bottled nutrients

534
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,798
or are mineral based nutrients what

535
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:05,558
brand are you using man I mean I'm kind

536
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:07,079
of all over the place to be honest um

537
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:08,960
I've shed almost everything on the

538
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,639
market I'm just like everyone else when

539
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,079
you first start off you see so many

540
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,759
different things you like I got to try

541
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,399
all this I'm going to buy this one first

542
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,119
and buy this one next but um over the

543
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,038
past couple of years I've you know I've

544
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,678
dibbled and dabbled with like uh raw

545
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:24,679
salts I like the raw salts a little bit

546
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,280
um but my last score actually used Cana

547
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:28,840
I like Cana too Cana has really good

548
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:31,000
nutrients I used the the ter

549
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:33,480
the Terra blend the Terra it's called ve

550
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,599
Terra Vega Terra Vega blend it's pretty

551
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,640
good uh pretty good line and then how do

552
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:40,279
you go about the transplanting process I

553
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,280
mean you've got so many plants you can

554
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,879
really spend a lot of time transplanting

555
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:46,440
or there are things you can do to make

556
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,200
things more efficient how do you do the

557
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,480
transplanting process and keep things

558
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,600
efficient man I mean that that's a hard

559
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,640
one because uh I don't think there's any

560
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:56,879
really efficient way to get know 300

561
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,360
plants in a pot you mean other than just

562
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,000
lining them up dumping in the soil and

563
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,279
trying to transplant them as quick as

564
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,279
possible and get them under the lights

565
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:09,079
um that's how we usually did it you know

566
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:10,879
we just Lin them up uh dump it in uh we

567
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:12,558
would uh build the hole make the hole

568
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,960
for the for the new for the new uh

569
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,200
transplant uh we Ed some Michael rise

570
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,679
but you know put a little something in

571
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,120
there for the soil for the for the roots

572
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,480
to be happy other than just dirt and um

573
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,918
that was most that was like the most

574
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,798
efficient way I mean you're not doing it

575
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,960
by yourself of course but like you know

576
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:30,798
maybe two guys three guys and just kind

577
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,720
of have a nice chain going down the line

578
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,558
and getting them getting them all poted

579
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,200
up and putting into their new home

580
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:37,359
pretty straightforward there so you've

581
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,759
done your transplant you're in your

582
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,798
final container which is one or two

583
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:44,519
gallon when does your first feeding

584
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:47,720
happen and what does that consist of my

585
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:49,759
first feeding well it really depends on

586
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,759
what medium we're using or what medium

587
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:56,400
am I using I mean I've tried different

588
00:20:52,759 --> 00:21:01,240
uh different styles of growing um I've

589
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,759
tried dwc you know I really like dwc um

590
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,720
very efficient uh super fast plant Grill

591
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,759
is probably twice the twice the rate in

592
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,839
the when it's just constantly eating

593
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,359
water all day and food all day um less

594
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:16,119
maintenance it's definitely less

595
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:19,479
maintenance when you grow uh dwc style

596
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:21,839
um cocoa core uh that's kind of time

597
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,839
consuming as well sometimes you got to

598
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,720
um charge the bricks if the bricks

599
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,119
aren't charged you got to charge them up

600
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,278
or you got to inflate them because

601
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,558
they'll come all like compressed

602
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:32,640
together so you got to get them

603
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,240
uncompressed U but on the larger scale

604
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,880
we kind of went toward the other ones

605
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,000
towards the mesh bag that already kind

606
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,480
of had the hole in it for your Rockwall

607
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,640
Cube and that kind of made things really

608
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,558
quicker and efficient cuz now you're not

609
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,120
know putting a bunch of stuff and put a

610
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,879
bunch of soil stuff in a pot the holees

611
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,798
there all we're doing is taking the

612
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,640
clone from the Clone Dome and dumping it

613
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:55,519
right into the new hole and that made

614
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,600
things really efficient for us when it's

615
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:00,558
time to transplant the Clones okay and

616
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:03,798
then as far as feedings were using raw

617
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:06,960
or we using Cana at that point um yeah

618
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:11,158
so when my first feeding is

619
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,400
probably well see so I use so it's tough

620
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:16,400
because I use Fox Farm sometimes and we

621
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,400
know um Fox Farm runs pretty hot so if

622
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,440
I'm using the ocean Forest I probably

623
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,320
won't feed for a couple of weeks but if

624
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,919
you use the Happy Frog um you know you

625
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:27,678
can probably start feeding your first

626
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:29,799
feed probably two weeks in two and a

627
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,519
half weeks in it'll be on the Lighter

628
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:35,440
Side um it probably do something like a

629
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:40,200
a 1.0 EC something that's really light

630
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:42,960
and uh pH it around uh 62 to 61 if I'm

631
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:46,679
in soil if I'm in Cocoa it might be more

632
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,159
around 59 60 okay and then for 300

633
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,720
plants I mean what size of container are

634
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:54,840
you mixing that in I mean are you in a a

635
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:57,440
large Reservoir do you have a automated

636
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:58,519
system drip system or like how does that

637
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,960
work out

638
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:02,519
yeah that would be on definitely

639
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,038
irrigation fertigation for all those

640
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:07,558
plants U steaking everything uh having

641
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:12,599
each each uh each pot probably get two

642
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:16,839
stakes each um set up the tables uh get

643
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:18,959
the emitters in drippers um that's how

644
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:20,720
we would go about that and then this is

645
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,120
hooked up to a reservoir and it's just

646
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,960
dripping down on there throughout the

647
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:25,519
grow cycle and what is it like once a

648
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,079
week or something you're changing up the

649
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:31,599
ratio of nutrients in the reservoir or

650
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:33,240
what yeah so we would uh we would change

651
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,719
up the recipe not the recipe we would

652
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,640
change up the feeding um so we like to

653
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,120
probably do like some micro feeding I

654
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,080
know micro feeding is pretty big in the

655
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,639
commercial field so they would do a lot

656
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:46,678
of micro feeding when I was there um we

657
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,799
probably water three to four times a day

658
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:50,200
um I think they we kind of like switched

659
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:53,558
up the the

660
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,080
EC um I think it would be heavier in in

661
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:56,519
the morning and then toward the end of

662
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:58,519
the day we kind of give it on the

663
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,278
Lighter Side just so get that balance in

664
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:03,158
the medium so we don't get any type of

665
00:24:00,278 --> 00:24:05,119
like nutrient burn or anything got it

666
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:07,520
okay so switching things up a little bit

667
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,879
let's get into lighting now you've

668
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,278
worked in indoor operations I'm looking

669
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,640
at your Instagram right now and there's

670
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:15,000
just tons of Lights stacked down the

671
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,679
entire way do you have any tips for

672
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,720
lighting such as like grow light

673
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:22,200
distance or dimming par things like that

674
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,960
I've had my shareff plenty of Lights

675
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:28,519
there's like so many um I actually think

676
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,200
um I like t5s a lot in the beginning cuz

677
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:32,278
they're just so fluorescent a little

678
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,960
little less intensity for the plants and

679
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:35,558
they just love it like you can actually

680
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,079
have the plants like kissing the lights

681
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:39,918
and that will do no harm to them you

682
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:43,278
know the the power on those is usually

683
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:45,440
between two and 300 which is nothing um

684
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:48,398
of course in veg you want to be a little

685
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,840
stronger um because you want the in veg

686
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:52,558
you kind of want the blues so the blues

687
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:55,599
are anywhere between 400 and 500 micro

688
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,480
moles UM Vet and and flour you want to

689
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:01,918
be a little higher maybe in between six

690
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:03,759
and 700 and um and if you're having any

691
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,320
type of like um if your plants are

692
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:07,640
starting to stretch a little too much on

693
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:09,079
your tables and you're not liking the

694
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,799
stretch and you can always lower your

695
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:12,519
lights and that will help stop the

696
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:13,839
stretch and if your plants are too Squat

697
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:15,679
and you kind of want them to know

698
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:17,199
stretch a little more then you know

699
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,440
raise your lights up a little bit

700
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,240
probably between 18 and 20 Ines just to

701
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,919
get them to stretch up a little more and

702
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,038
um another big thing is uh environment

703
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,840
with the temperature I know that um if

704
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:32,798
you have a a huge swing difference uh

705
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:34,879
between your your daytime light and your

706
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,200
your nighttime temperatures I know that

707
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,880
also causes a little bit of stretch so

708
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,319
if you can really get your environment

709
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,080
dialed into to where the temperature

710
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,158
kind of stays the same it is during the

711
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:45,558
day when the lights on that would also

712
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,520
avoid your plants from stretching if

713
00:25:45,558 --> 00:25:49,119
you're not looking to get them too tall

714
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:53,918
so what temperature do you typically aim

715
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:57,798
for I typically aim for um in between 80

716
00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:00,000
and 84 uh like right now I run a LED and

717
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:01,359
the temperature kind of stays consistent

718
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,440
around

719
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,839
84 right now in the winter right now

720
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,720
it's winter time so in the winter time

721
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:09,839
here it's tough because there's really

722
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,880
no uh no humidity so the way I have it

723
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:13,918
set up right now on my tent is um I

724
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,720
actually leave the the back the back

725
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,000
vent open and I leave the one of the

726
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,360
side vents open and I kind of get I kind

727
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,480
of put a fan on the outside of the tent

728
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:25,038
that kind of blows air through through

729
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,159
the side vent and then um I have a fan

730
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:31,240
also clipped to the pole for circulation

731
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:34,200
and then um my temperature kind of stays

732
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,798
really steady between um

733
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,679
84 for temperature and my humidity is

734
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:40,839
always low because it's just so dry here

735
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:45,399
I mean in the winter time humidity here

736
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:48,119
is probably 20 lucky to be 25 or 30% so

737
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:50,038
I do use a humidifier in veg so I try to

738
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:52,278
know I try to get it up to at least 45

739
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:53,798
in veg mean it's real it's better in the

740
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:56,480
summer time here because the humidity is

741
00:26:53,798 --> 00:27:00,240
a little high it might be at 45 or 50

742
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,159
during the day which is good and um but

743
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,200
um I have um also have central heat

744
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,000
where I live right now so it kind of

745
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,880
helps keep my temperature uh this is and

746
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,720
steady where it's at because I can use

747
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,799
the central heat but I don't have

748
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,159
central air so I use a AC unit for the

749
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:18,119
window and that really helps me keep my

750
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,480
temperatures down than having the AC in

751
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:23,918
there and um with the and when the

752
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,880
lights are on you know it's um 84 in the

753
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,440
winter but in the summertime when I have

754
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:32,360
the lights on it's probably in between

755
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,919
80 81 that's the tires that to get and

756
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:37,398
um as far as when the lights off my

757
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:40,600
temperature is usually drop like maybe 8

758
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:43,558
or n degrees on the swing yeah my

759
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:45,359
humidity in the in the summertime is um

760
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:47,038
stays kind of consistent around that 50

761
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,240
range just because because Outdoors it's

762
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:49,839
kind of hot but in the winter that's

763
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,359
when it gets real rough around here you

764
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:54,398
know you have to use a humidifier to

765
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,918
keep it up um my temperature stay in

766
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:58,079
between there I mean they're they're

767
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,360
never really higher than no 8 four with

768
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:03,038
the LED that I run right now okay and

769
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:04,719
then what about CO2 are you adding CO2

770
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:06,519
into the grow space in order to try to

771
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,640
get better growth I've actually tried

772
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:11,359
cl2 um when I first started I was

773
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,000
actually making my own cl2 just getting

774
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,759
a regular little like Coke bottle soda

775
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,240
bottle and then know using H yeast and

776
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:20,158
sugar and then letting it do its thing

777
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,798
letting it cook it thing in the in the

778
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,919
tent and then you know I started buying

779
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:28,240
the exhale bags um I tried the canisters

780
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:32,120
I tried the CO2 Pros

781
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,839
they all seem to do pretty well um but

782
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:36,558
right now I don't really use it because

783
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:39,240
um I have a monitor and usually the CO2

784
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:42,079
in my house already is around 600 PPM

785
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,038
which is not bad so I don't really try

786
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,839
to supplement more CO2 if I don't I

787
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:49,679
don't need to me I I get pretty good

788
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:52,278
yields right now so but I do I do dible

789
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,759
and Dabble with it if if necessary I've

790
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:56,278
tried it and um they work you know

791
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:58,200
they're very efficient I mean I could I

792
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:59,798
can see the difference and on the end

793
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,240
result when uh when it's all said and

794
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:04,119
done it can definitely be helpful you

795
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,720
know especially if you are running a

796
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:08,199
little bit higher of temps you know

797
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,558
which you kind of are with the 84 degree

798
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,840
Fahrenheit having that additional CO2

799
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:15,000
can help and of course having the high

800
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:18,119
lighting can also help with growth for

801
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,079
sure let's get into training plants man

802
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:23,199
I can only imagine 300 plants and having

803
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:24,839
a train all of them I've talked with

804
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,038
other folks that worked in cultiv

805
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:29,678
cultivation facilities in the past and

806
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:32,558
they have void some parts of training

807
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,320
because it takes so long talk to us

808
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,158
about how you do plant training when

809
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,558
you're working in these facilities or

810
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,320
when you worked in these facilities you

811
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:40,960
say was there certain type of training

812
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,720
you would do for all the plants were

813
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,720
were there training that you would avoid

814
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,759
to do because they's so timec consuming

815
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,880
or what would you typically do for that

816
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:52,119
yeah we typically try to avoid to do any

817
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,559
type of low stress training um it would

818
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:57,000
just take too long for the for the plant

819
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,759
to recover or get to where we want it to

820
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,558
be I mean when you're in the commercial

821
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:02,158
field everything's on a timeline

822
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:04,079
Everything Everything feels kind of

823
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,640
rushed so there's really no time to do

824
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:09,359
anything extra um so we didn't really do

825
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,880
too much uh uh training or trying to low

826
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:14,319
stress train anything um but we did do

827
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,559
we did a whole lot of fem topping and

828
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,079
that was like one of the main things we

829
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:20,519
did a lot we never really did any like

830
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:22,278
like like uh topping topping like

831
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,679
regular topping like cutting branches or

832
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:25,240
anything because uh we just didn't want

833
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,000
to do that unless we were taking clones

834
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,038
off the moms but um yeah we did a lot of

835
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,359
fem topping to get more tops and more

836
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:35,519
shoots and um when we put them in the

837
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,839
flower you know we we do uh we put the

838
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:38,640
trellis up we'll put them through the

839
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:40,599
trellis and then know we will actually

840
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,480
remove any branches that were kind of

841
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:44,839
crisscrossing across the table hitting

842
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,360
other plants stuff like that that's

843
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:47,839
about as far as we got with going with

844
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:50,000
training we just didn't want too much

845
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,079
stuff touching each other you know try

846
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,919
to avoid getting powdery Mill do want to

847
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,480
have good air flow we don't want to have

848
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,440
no thrip showing up so we would cut off

849
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,880
any branches that that were

850
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,038
crisscrossing with each other or just

851
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,880
didn't fit fit well in the in the

852
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:06,000
trellis on the bench now would you limit

853
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,440
the topping or fimming actually you

854
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,720
mentioned would you limit that to once

855
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,919
per grow cycle only in the veg or were

856
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,720
you fimming a plant multiple times in

857
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,960
veg and I assume you avoid doing that in

858
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,240
flow yeah we avoid it in flour we would

859
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,278
actually probably fem top twice we fem

860
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,679
Top early in veg maybe a couple of weeks

861
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:27,278
in and then we do it again right before

862
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,120
we send them over to the flower room

863
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:32,919
would do it again just to get some

864
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:34,398
additional topage going and um in the

865
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:35,880
end it worked out you know we wind up

866
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:37,678
know you go on there with just maybe

867
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,240
know eight tops you know we go we do a

868
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,759
film before go in there and then we'll

869
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,200
have 16 tops you know smart going after

870
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:46,398
the film in a commercial operation you

871
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,600
know not only does it help promote that

872
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:50,398
bottom growth those branches growing up

873
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:53,119
but you're getting more than just a

874
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:56,158
couple tops coming fimming it could be

875
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:57,959
three or four tops coming from that one

876
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,760
fim area so don't make sense that that's

877
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,519
used in a commercial operation and quite

878
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:04,798
frankly I feel like people should use it

879
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,240
more in homeg grow operations as well I

880
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:09,398
personally feel like I should use it

881
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,038
more uh in the filming is easier said

882
00:32:09,398 --> 00:32:13,119
than done you know you got to get it in

883
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:16,759
the right spot I've tried to film so

884
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:18,079
many times and it just didn't work and

885
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:20,079
then I've topped the plant before and

886
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:20,918
accidentally turned into a film so it

887
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:22,759
definitely takes a little bit of

888
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:24,840
practice get in that perfect spot to

889
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:27,638
where it's actually going to fim and go

890
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:30,480
into a four different tops versus too

891
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:32,119
but yeah good tip for training there and

892
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,679
making things more efficient now pruning

893
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:36,079
plants you talked about how you you

894
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,120
would remove branches that were kind of

895
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:41,199
overlapping with other plants that's one

896
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:43,079
form of pruning what about like

897
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,440
lollipopping to where you're removing

898
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:47,119
the lower third or lower quarter growth

899
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,320
of the plant would you do that at all

900
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:51,678
also I want to Loop in defoliation so

901
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:55,599
we're moving leaves would you do that at

902
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,320
all yes that that's very important um so

903
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,759
when we do so actually when we put up

904
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:00,319
the trellis the first trellis that

905
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:02,919
actually goes up that's kind of like the

906
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:05,720
Baseline for the plant so wherever that

907
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:07,679
trellis lands on on the on the table

908
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,038
anything below that first trellis

909
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,720
Baseline is going to be stripped off so

910
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:13,839
we can transfer all that energy right to

911
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,679
the top of the plant you know get really

912
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:19,038
good coers and vigorous growth from the

913
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:20,559
from the top of the plant up and then um

914
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,720
once that started to take off you know

915
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:26,079
you put your second trellis on to

916
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,519
support that and um yeah that's what

917
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,879
that's what we that's how we did it we

918
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,399
would do it like that and um we would

919
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:35,440
defoliate um we defoliate all through

920
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:37,398
the whole plant cycle I mean always

921
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,440
always tell people you know always I

922
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:40,759
always ask people do you like haircuts

923
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,558
and they'll be like yes well like well

924
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:44,558
these plants love haircuts so it's

925
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:46,440
always good to give the plan a haircut

926
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:48,200
because you I know some folks get a

927
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,000
little worried about taking off so many

928
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,000
fan leaves they like oh no I can't do

929
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,119
that but they don't realize that you

930
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,159
know you're going to take all these

931
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,638
leaves off today and it's going to be

932
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:59,880
fully back to what it was 7 Days Later

933
00:33:57,638 --> 00:34:01,599
like you did nothing and then they were

934
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,360
like oh no you was right you know I was

935
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:05,319
like yeah I mean these plants just love

936
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:08,960
haircuts I don't know they just love

937
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:12,319
them and um we would uh defoliate all

938
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:15,559
psycho um dur flower we would actually

939
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:18,760
defoliate and do the do the pruning or

940
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:21,239
the lollipop in before they go in and

941
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,119
then we would do it again maybe 20 25

942
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,118
days later we go in and do another heavy

943
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,320
strip and then just kind of let it ride

944
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,280
out from there until Harvest and and we

945
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,679
may take a little more fan leaves off

946
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,800
during before Harvest but we like to

947
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,679
keep as many leaves on as possible

948
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,320
toward the end of flower okay so that's

949
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,639
flower and then question for when you're

950
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,320
in veg you mentioned stripping things

951
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,200
down were you doing that every single

952
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:46,919
day or were you like limiting to every

953
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:49,759
three days every five days or whatever I

954
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,799
would say we were doing maybe every

955
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,119
every couple of weeks I mean sometimes

956
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,960
we would just pick off leaves just to

957
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,480
pick off leaves if we think it was no no

958
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,800
taking up too much light blocking the

959
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,039
lower we just pull it off pull off one

960
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,839
leaf but now we would we would wait you

961
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:04,880
know maybe a week or two then we go in

962
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:06,799
there hit it hard you know it'll grow

963
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,720
back plan to be much bigger we go in

964
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,839
there hit it again it'll get much bigger

965
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:13,078
and then sooner or later we're going to

966
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:14,759
have to move with the flower and that's

967
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:16,680
when we really give it know know the

968
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,359
full haircut that we want to give it

969
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:21,440
before it takes off and flower got it

970
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:23,559
any tips for the flowering stage to kind

971
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,880
of make things more efficient there

972
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:27,960
definitely use your trellis put your

973
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,079
trellis up um

974
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,440
keep the room clean when have a clean

975
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,560
environment make sure you have proper

976
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,200
air flow um I know a lot of people like

977
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:38,679
to chase uh VPD that's a really big

978
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:40,759
thing in the industry um I'm not really

979
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:42,519
a fan of it I think it's very dangerous

980
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,599
playing with that it's a dangerous game

981
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:47,559
but if you have it down pack no hats off

982
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:49,119
to you I just know um I mean that's one

983
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:53,039
of the things we did a lot there we did

984
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:54,640
Chase the VPD where I worked um it it

985
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:55,920
was okay I know it causes a little

986
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:57,838
problem you just got to be make sure you

987
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,280
have the proper air flow you don't want

988
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:02,358
to get powdery Mill do um you don't want

989
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,880
to get any pests showing up and that's

990
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:06,159
really the main reason um you got to be

991
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,559
really careful when you're playing with

992
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:11,199
the VPD I know a lot of people just will

993
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:13,039
ignore VPD because of that you know some

994
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:15,838
uh that's

995
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:18,119
me yeah running a higher humidity which

996
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:20,078
is what most of these VPD charts call

997
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:22,640
for and unfortunately there are several

998
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,280
different VPD charts on the internet

999
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:27,598
today and they contradict with each

1000
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,000
other and that makes things so confusing

1001
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,680
for people but generally speaking it

1002
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,800
usually calls for higher humidity in the

1003
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:36,118
flowering stage where if you're running

1004
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,119
a higher humidity and you don't have

1005
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,160
good air flow for example you get Bud

1006
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:42,760
Rod I've had that I've come across that

1007
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:44,679
before unfortunately not good at all to

1008
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,440
be in flour and all of a sudden you spot

1009
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:48,199
Bud Rod happening you got to chop off

1010
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,720
colas and get rid of them or even

1011
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:51,719
powdery mil do you know that's another

1012
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:53,598
thing and of course one of the root

1013
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:55,318
causes is stagnant air so having the

1014
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,000
good air flow but yeah I know a lot of

1015
00:36:55,318 --> 00:36:59,480
people just ignore VPD because of that

1016
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,440
though no matter what even though if it

1017
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,719
calls for above 60% RH in flour they'll

1018
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,318
still keep it lower than that because

1019
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:09,039
they don't want to risk getting any sort

1020
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:12,639
of Powter mildew or any sort of Bud Rod

1021
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:14,318
so now let's move on to harvesting

1022
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:16,639
another thing where it's like you know

1023
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:19,000
when we're talking about large scale 300

1024
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:21,000
plants harvesting that it's got to be

1025
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,838
very timec consuming top chopping down

1026
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,280
plants moving them around getting them

1027
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:27,480
from the flower room to the dry room

1028
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,640
talk about harvesting how you go about

1029
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,000
making things efficient there oh you

1030
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:33,199
just got to have a lot of people on

1031
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,400
hands that day we got to have everybody

1032
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:38,519
in the building all hands on deck for

1033
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,519
that uh it's just a constant train of

1034
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:43,759
chopping passing it down the line uh

1035
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,880
tagging it uh putting it on the on the

1036
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,359
dolly taking it down to the to the dry

1037
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:52,480
room hanging it and you know we can take

1038
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:55,318
down maybe a 300 plant room in probably

1039
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,639
probably an hour hour and a half tops

1040
00:37:55,318 --> 00:38:00,199
you know get everything down and hung up

1041
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:04,039
in the other room weighed get the get

1042
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:05,439
the wet weight weigh it um I mean that's

1043
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:07,159
the only way I think that you can really

1044
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,960
be efficient is just have everybody all

1045
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,399
hands on deck that day because it's

1046
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,920
going to be a long day without having a

1047
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,838
lot of hands and that's similar for a

1048
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,119
lot of homerow operations as well I mean

1049
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:19,119
when I was running 12 large plants and

1050
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,880
I'm I'm maxed out here at 12 plants so

1051
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,440
I'm a small hom grower that's all I can

1052
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,599
grow in my state is 12 plants I can't go

1053
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,358
above that legally uh but I usually have

1054
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:30,440
call up all my friends hey come on over

1055
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:32,039
we're harvesting or even trimming you

1056
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,920
know all hands on deck for trimming

1057
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:36,480
because that's very time-consuming

1058
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,200
process now they have bull trimmer now

1059
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,039
and a bunch of machine trimming now

1060
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:41,799
which makes things a lot more efficient

1061
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:43,800
but all Hands-On deck back in the day

1062
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,280
when we were just using hand trimmers

1063
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,560
the entire time so I can totally relate

1064
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,000
to that on a homeg grow standpoint I'm

1065
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,279
actually going to circle back because we

1066
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,199
actually tried a couple of different

1067
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,480
things when we Harvest them before me

1068
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,399
one time we tried to actually harvesting

1069
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:01,039
individual branches and that that was

1070
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,639
just like o and um I mean it works but

1071
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,318
that definitely takes up a lot of time

1072
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,559
we kind of figured you know chopping

1073
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:09,239
down the whole plant at the base make

1074
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:11,960
things a lot easier hang the whole plant

1075
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:14,159
uh space it out perfectly and you know

1076
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,880
that that saved us a whole lot of time

1077
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:17,239
just chopping the whole plant and then

1078
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,559
rather than doing the individual

1079
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:21,838
branches yeah great point I assume

1080
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:24,239
you're taking all those into a specific

1081
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:27,599
room for drying what's your drying

1082
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:29,639
conditions temperature and humidity

1083
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,800
um you know that I think that's really

1084
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:33,239
preference for a lot of people I know

1085
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,480
everyone has their preference where they

1086
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:38,879
think The Sweet Spot is um on the

1087
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,480
commercial side you know they used to

1088
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,480
play around with it quite a bit you know

1089
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,519
I've seen them run

1090
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,760
60% uh temperature 45% humidity

1091
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:52,000
sometimes they'll put it at

1092
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:54,440
5550 um they like to kind of like uh

1093
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,318
fluctuated a little bit I mean like

1094
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,920
they'll go 3 days at 6060 then the next

1095
00:39:57,318 --> 00:40:03,159
three days they'll drop it down to like

1096
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:04,880
55 45 just trying to uh like super dry

1097
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:06,480
it but then give it then give it back

1098
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,039
moisture a little bit but then take it

1099
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,719
away again then give it back to it a

1100
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,440
little bit but you really want to get

1101
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:13,039
that real slow dry you know you don't

1102
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,119
want to be chopping down too early and

1103
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:17,480
Flash dry anything CU then you just

1104
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,480
wasted the whole however long it took

1105
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,800
you to grow that cycle you're going to

1106
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,599
ruin it because you flash d it so they

1107
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,560
played around with it quite a bit my

1108
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:30,559
personal preference you know my last har

1109
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:33,159
I just took down I actually ran um

1110
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:35,480
6562 and it worked out pretty well for

1111
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:37,039
me nice nice I was going to ask you what

1112
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,358
your personal preference was so what

1113
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:41,719
about like length of dry how long do you

1114
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:45,358
like to dry for a number of days I like

1115
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:48,598
to really slow dry I'm going 14 maybe 17

1116
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:50,960
days if I can but if not then you know

1117
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:52,960
know I'll pull it before it gets too too

1118
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,199
dry like I know we're supposed to I know

1119
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,440
you know the the the grow Bros always

1120
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:58,279
say you know you want to wait till until

1121
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,400
it gets to that point where you know the

1122
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:03,040
branches are snapping I think that might

1123
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,200
be a little too too too long of a drag

1124
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:07,838
cuz now everything is going to be kind

1125
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:09,960
of crunchy so um I kind of wait for the

1126
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:12,078
the stems to be a little a little bendy

1127
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,159
to where they might snap but they're not

1128
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,079
going to snap and I think that's kind of

1129
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:19,960

1147
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:55,559
monitors what's going on inside the

1148
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,560
outside the bag as far as humidity you

1149
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:59,400
know I try to keep uh when my when my

1150
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:02,519
Bud's actually Ching I try to keep it

1151
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,440
between like 55 and 60 on the inside and

1152
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:06,159
if it goes below that or above it you

1153
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,000
know I kind of just crack it and off gas

1154
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:09,440
it and kind of do a hard reset and

1155
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,760
hopefully it goes back to where I want

1156
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,000
it and um on the larger scale I mean

1157
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,640
when I was in the commercial field they

1158
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,800
didn't really do any of that turkey bag

1159
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:20,199
stuff they just used uh they just line

1160
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,920
up these totes with plastic you know put

1161
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:24,639
them in there and then closed the

1162
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,760
plastic lids and kind of just waited it

1163
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:30,440
out and I just kept everything in the

1164
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,720
dry room um yeah mean the dry room was

1165
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,760
cold so they just kept everything in

1166
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:36,759
there and keep everything uh in in a

1167
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,720
dark cool uh cool environment that's

1168
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:41,640
good storage conditions as well now were

1169
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:43,519
they opening up the bins to burp them on

1170
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:45,358
a daily basis or what was the process

1171
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,159
for that yeah we would burping those at

1172
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:49,318
least once a day you know smelted

1173
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:51,318
amazing too but yeah we would burp them

1174
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:52,159
once a day try to off gas and we do that

1175
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:55,239
for

1176
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:56,679
probably a week two weeks and then after

1177
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,799
that we just kind of keep keep it shut

1178
00:42:56,679 --> 00:43:01,078
you know let let the Nuggets do its

1179
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,160
thing you know we go in there and maybe

1180
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,680
occasionally burp it and then after that

1181
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:08,279
it goes off to packaging and then off to

1182
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:10,838
the store and then people buy it right

1183
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:13,160
yeah yeah nice nice so yeah we just went

1184
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:15,558
from seed all the way through Harvest

1185
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:18,000
drying and curing trimming we didn't

1186
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:19,839
talk about that any uh tips for trimming

1187
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,480
making that more efficient well the way

1188
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:23,519
the way to make trim more efficient

1189
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,159
honestly is make sure you don't have any

1190
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:28,039
uh any popcorn buds make sure you have

1191
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:30,838
all nice big colas know that makes

1192
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:32,719
trimming a lot easier I mean I mean uh

1193
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:34,480
trim machines are good know they do

1194
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:36,799
knock off a lot of tric combs but some

1195
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,639
of them are are pretty good um I know

1196
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,559
people like the wet trim wet trim is not

1197
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:43,159
bad I've done some wet trimming and then

1198
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:45,119
we just hang it up in the net let it dry

1199
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:48,358
but um yeah I would say just you know

1200
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,680
try to avoid popcorn nugs um the bigger

1201
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:51,799
the bigger the bigger you can get your

1202
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,279
nuggets and your colas you know it' be

1203
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,079
easier on the back end when it's time to

1204
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,599
trim it you know and get it out to the

1205
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:00,640
shelves seems to be pretty split between

1206
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:03,160
people who prefer wet trim or dry trim

1207
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:05,118
50/50 really I mean all with all the

1208
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:07,558
people I talked over the years it's one

1209
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,800
or the other and uh they're hardcore on

1210
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:12,280
their stance there I personally like the

1211
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,280
dry trim and U I do the same thing with

1212
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,519
you we're talking about like ly buds or

1213
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,519
the popcorn buds those actually nowadays

1214
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:21,119
just end up in my trim pile to where I'm

1215
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:24,079
using that for Edibles really for oil

1216
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,720
butter and then making Edibles so yeah

1217
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:29,280
I've gotten less and less picky about

1218
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:30,719
trimming up lar or popcorn buds just

1219
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,119
goes in my trim pile and then I just

1220
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:36,118
keep the top nuggets so yeah so do you

1221
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,599
have any other tips just overall for

1222
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:39,000
making things more efficient throughout

1223
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,559
any part of the growth cycle that we

1224
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,719
didn't cover yet um just just be patient

1225
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:46,160
man I mean gardening and growing in

1226
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:47,399
general is just patience I know I know

1227
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:49,199
when you're on the commercial side you

1228
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,280
can feel kind of rushed or things feel

1229
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:52,480
kind of rushed but just be patient I

1230
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,359
mean everything's not going to be

1231
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:59,519
perfect um take your time uh do what you

1232
00:44:56,358 --> 00:45:02,279
can do um yeah I

1233
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,920
mean patience is key man I mean that's

1234
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,480
Garden is supposed to be relaxing so

1235
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,639
just be patient with everything you're

1236
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,358
doing uh you're going to make mistakes

1237
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:11,480
so nothing's going to be perfect yeah

1238
00:45:10,358 --> 00:45:13,039
I'm glad you brought that up I think

1239
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,519
there's a big difference between being

1240
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:16,960
efficient and cutting Corners you know

1241
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:18,679
and cutting Corners that's what's going

1242
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,800
to potentially get you into hot water

1243
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:21,960
right if you're doing things where you

1244
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,519
really shouldn't be doing it you're

1245
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,358
doing it only to save time but you're

1246
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:28,759
risking quality so yeah big difference

1247
00:45:26,358 --> 00:45:30,480
between being efficient and cutting

1248
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,359
Corners all right so let's wrap things

1249

1250
