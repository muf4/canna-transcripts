1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,679
coming up on garden talk pressure

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,839
treated two by fours

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,679
i spaced it out around five feet and

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,400
goes the length of 34 feet

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,679
and then i have the opening on each end

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,919
with a door

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,679
green lacewing larva and that's what the

8
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,519
alison flowers are for

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,519
because they'll eat that while they're

10
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,559
staying around and getting to the mites

11
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,518
or getting to the

12
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:25,118
other pests the plant doesn't care i'm

13
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,959
an advocate for that i really don't

14
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,359
think the plant cares about

15
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,640
the science that we keep trying to

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,960
implement on it

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,759
i think it's overboard and just a sales

18
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,840
tactic

19
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,759
the california spider mite will swim

20
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,320
through almost all your products

21
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,679
you have to be spraying diligently like

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,238
every three days

23
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,280
it was 122 degrees in there and the

24
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:49,599
plants were just

25
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,600

mcnasty

140
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,280
welcome to the garden talk podcast how

141
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,039

00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,319
i'm great man thanks for having me

143
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,520
thanks for having me i've been watching

144
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,800
you for a while

145
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,240
it's crazy to be up here

146
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,840
yeah thanks for joining me i've been

147
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,160
watching you for a little while too

148
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,000
and uh one thing i noticed is that you

149
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,919
do a lot of greenhouse growing

150
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,680
and i haven't had anybody on the podcast

151
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,120
yet that does greenhouse growing so i'm

152
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,000
super excited for this one to kind of

153
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,918
dig in

154
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,439
and find out what you do in the

155
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,758
greenhouse so

156
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,199
but before we get into all of that can

157
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,960
you tell us a little bit about yourself

158
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,680
and kind of how you got into gardening

159
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,039
well a friend of mine showed me that

160
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,840
plants are the future

161
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,879
you know you need to learn some

162
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,758
agriculture feed your family if the

163
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:02,800
worst case scenario

164
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,000
so we just started out strawberries bell

165
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,879
peppers

166
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,240
all kind of easier things squash

167
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:12,000
everything like that

168
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,160
zucchini and um the greenhouse is great

169
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,199
because you can just control

170
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,520
the cooler season you can heat it up

171
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,960
and you can vent it out when it's hot

172
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,240
when it's hot it is kind of

173
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:26,799
difficult to keep it cool though

174
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,000
that's a issue so you decided to launch

175
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,439
a youtube channel and now you're

176
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,959
showcasing plants right

177
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,120
when did you launch the youtube channel

178
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,319
and um how many subscribers are you up

179
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,918
to now

180
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,279
uh uh embarrassingly i'm only at 5500

181
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:43,758
subscribers

182
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:45,839
and i've been doing this for like 2016

183
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,038
but um it's starting to pick up more and

184
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,478
more now

185
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,000
people are seeing the channel and

186
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,120
they're like i never seen this channel i

187
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,879
would have been subscribed

188
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,560
so maybe i'm doing something wrong in

189
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,079
the algorithm yeah

190
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,240
yeah youtube algorithms is definitely

191
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,758
tough to to work around i mean they'll

192
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,319
black you lose to you like that you know

193
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,479
no prob

194
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,080
no problem so but now 5500 that's a good

195
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,038
amount there's people who would kill

196
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,279
that that much

197
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,159
you know that's that's a really good

198
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,159
idea so

199
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,439
and then you also have a podcast channel

200
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,000
now huh can you tell us a little bit

201
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,478
about that

202
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
yeah the green table podcast with my

203
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,159
co-host beast coast

204
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,038
we're having some fun over there that's

205
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,199
how i initially found

206
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,599
out about you is through that podcast

207
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,840
you did an interview with thc titan

208
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,720
uh the breeder of square one genetics

209
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,959
and that one

210
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,639
uh i was super stoked to hear he dropped

211
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,159
some gems on that one

212
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,000
and uh yeah you guys are doing your

213
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,680
thing over there i'm super pumped

214
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,120
that you guys have that going something

215
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,759
i tune in from

216
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,360
time to time and uh for those audiences

217
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,600
watching or listening in

218
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,800
just search green table podcast on

219
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,039
youtube and you'll

220
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,160
come across it so yeah i appreciate the

221
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,000
look man

222
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,080
we're just over there having some fun

223
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,959
kicking back definitely good times for

224
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,079
sure

225
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,758
so let's get into green house growing so

226
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,359
let's talk all about greenhouse growing

227
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,960
i think it's probably most appropriate

228
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,560
to start with kind of

229
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,000
you know i know you have multiple

230
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,120
greenhouses right so

231
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,120
can you tell us like a little bit about

232
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,000
what size greenhouses they are and the

233
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,079
construction

234
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,478
like uh you know there are several ways

235
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:16,959
to construct a greenhouse what do you do

236
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:18,959
how did you build it it's all a learning

237
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,399
a learning thing the first greenhouse

238
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,279
was a 10 by

239
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,359
34. i still have that uh and i'll just

240
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,519
use the space because that's what i had

241
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,560
if i could go longer or wider i would

242
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:34,079
have but for some reason this 10 foot

243
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,120
is so easy to manage you can

244
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,279
put the great amount of plants in there

245
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,560
everything can be healthy the fans are

246
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,799
going down

247
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,038
um the center row i have about four

248
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,439
beams going down the center

249
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,598
pvc goes over well let me just start

250
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:54,478
about the construction

251
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:57,680
so the outside i'm using two by fours

252
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,680
uh pressure treated two by fours i space

253
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,478
it out around five feet

254
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,038
and goes the length of 34 feet and then

255
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,719
i have

256
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:08,639
the opening on each end with a door

257
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,919
uh you just construct a door you know

258
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,680
it's just simple

259
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,240
two by two framing something really

260
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,038
simple just to keep it open or closed

261
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,439
to vent out and then i run it two by

262
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,439
four across the top

263
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,759
for the frame and then put 20 foot of

264
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,478
pvc and that goes from

265
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,919
just just started at the 2x4 and wrap it

266
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,719
all the way around the top

267
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,519
screw it in put some plastic on it and

268
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,519
that's it

269
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,879
it's really simple what type of ply is

270
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,158
there a special type of plastic that you

271
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,439
put over the top or

272
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:42,319
or what uh six mil plastic works

273
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,519
i had this woven plastic but it wasn't

274
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,760
uv rated

275
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,200
so it the sun just burnt it up before

276
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,919
the season could finish

277
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,759
wow okay and then i know in one of your

278
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,559
greenhouses you have like a material on

279
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:54,240
the bottom

280
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,319
too it's like a black material on the

281
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,320
bottom shade cloth

282
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,080
shade cloth no it's not shade cloth it's

283
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,760
actually ground cloth

284
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,040
um it's woven also it allows for water

285
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,159
to go through

286
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,799
but not that fast

287
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,879
and it stops the pests from coming up

288
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,278
and eating your plants

289
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:17,039
so that's pretty good and that's like a

290
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:19,200
six foot roll by 300

291
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,958
get it for like 80 bucks and then you

292
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,160
also have the shade cloth up top too

293
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,199
right

294
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:28,159
sometimes this this this summer has been

295
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,320
crucial in california i don't know if

296
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:33,439
you're in california but um

297
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,160
it's crucial now i'm in vegas

298
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,920
it's hot out there too but yeah it's

299
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,519
been hot and dry so i've been needing to

300
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,519
cover the plants up

301
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,278
just give them a break so it sounds like

302
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,879
your construction is

303
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,720
pretty cheap right you mentioned you

304
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,320
know pressure treated wood that comes up

305
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,278
there's beams along the middle

306
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,760
uh it to two by fours kind of looping

307
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:54,000
around

308
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,838
plastic up top you get the cloth on the

309
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,559
bottom how much does something like that

310
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,360
roughly

311
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,559
cost would you say that greenhouse cost

312
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,519
me about

313
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,000
800 bucks about around 800 the plastic

314
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,320
is the most

315
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,958
expensive thing the plastic is costing

316
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,079
around 400 bucks a roll

317
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,879
you know um from 250 to 400 depending on

318
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,239
the size

319
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:18,078
the width and the length and the other

320
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,120
greenhouses those are four by

321
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:24,078
fours along the edges because this

322
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,759
needs more support because it's wider if

323
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,078
i could take it back i would just do 10

324
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,919
foot greenhouses though

325
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,199
very simple and then how are you

326
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,519
attaching the plastic

327
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,360
to the actual beams and stuff is it just

328
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,639
like a staple gun or what do you do no

329
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,320
no no that'll rip up

330
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:43,039
fast so you use those one by twos

331
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,879
like fern strips cut little pieces and

332
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,199
then just kind of screw it into the

333
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,559
plastic tight screw it into the wood

334
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,120
where it just smashes against the um the

335
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,799
other each

336
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,278
opposite sides of the wood and the

337
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,278
plastic in between

338
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,360
it keeps it all tight in that size

339
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:00,799
greenhouse how many plants do you run i

340
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,560
mean i know it's going to vary depending

341
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,919
on what type of plants you have you know

342
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,399
if you're growing lettuce

343
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,159
kale bok choy some type of leafy green

344
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,559
give it a lot more plants

345
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,159
in a greenhouse that size versus a plant

346
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:13,439
that particularly takes up like a 2 foot

347
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,120
by 2 foot space

348
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,760
a three foot by three foot space so on

349
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,759
and so forth so for you

350
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,120
for the plants you're growing how many

351
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,078
plants do you roughly

352
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,039
fit in those grow those greenhouses um a

353
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:29,199
good rule of thumb

354
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:32,399
is about two feet by two feet per plant

355
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,600
and i want some walkways

356
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,919
to get in and water even if it's set up

357
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,079
with

358
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,439
irrigation you still want to be able to

359
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,799
get in and

360
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:47,440
pick leaves and hand water sometimes

361
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:51,838
so in the 10 by 30 i have 60 plants

362
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:55,519
in a 20 by 30 i have two separate rows

363
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,560
so i have 96 plants gotcha

364
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,320
so you have two separate walkways how

365
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,638
wide are the walkways so you can get in

366
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,480
there about a foot and a half

367
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,720
okay yeah about a foot and a half so

368
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,159
about 18 inches or so

369
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,839
okay that makes sense and that should

370
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,679
get you should be able to get in there

371
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,440
do whatever you got to do

372
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:17,759
watering's a big thing right yes um what

373
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,800
type of water do you use do you use in

374
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,120
rain water

375
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,319
tap water well water tap water our water

376
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,919
comes out around

377
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:30,480
1 40 ppm so it's fairly

378
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:33,519
good i never seen any any issues with

379
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,720
cal mag or mineral deposits or anything

380
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,959
it's pretty good

381
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,240
and then so it's basically directly from

382
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,159
a hose are you

383
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,600
is there like a filter sometimes people

384
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,679
will attach a filter to it

385
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,200
to filter out some of them i used to use

386
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,000
filters and everything but

387
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,200
i've seen that it doesn't the plant

388
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,120
doesn't care

389
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,879
i'm an advocate for that i really don't

390
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,278
think the plant cares about

391
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,559
the science that we keep trying to

392
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:58,879
implement on it

393
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,679
i think it's overboard it's just a sales

394
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,360
tactic

395
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,679
i think the plants have been growing

396
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,360
fine and it's it will continue to

397
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,958
yeah there's a lot of things that we get

398
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,959
into and a lot of things you hear online

399
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,159
people on videos try to overcomplicate

400
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,958
the process

401
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,879
and i've had a lot of guests over the um

402
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,319
the six months that i've been doing this

403
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,399
i have just mentioned that they like to

404
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,079
keep it simple you know and so

405
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,679
doing things like that where you're not

406
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:22,799
filtering out some of the things

407
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,599
that are in there the plant will still

408
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,838
grow for sure now are you doing hand

409
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,399
watering or do you have an auto watering

410
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,600
system

411
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:34,639
or what i have both i do both

412
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,480
um i like to feed with hand watering i

413
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,360
like the food to get everywhere in the

414
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,199
media

415
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,959
so in the 20 by 30 greenhouses

416
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:47,838
i use beds so twice a week i'll

417
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:50,319
hand water the beds and then the rest of

418
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,800
the time i have it on the time dripper

419
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,600
and just straight water like once or

420
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,319
twice a day

421
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,680
because it's hot during the day so got

422
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,879
to keep it hydrated

423
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,559
gotcha can you talk a little bit more

424
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,919
about the dripper system you have you

425
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,198
assume you have it hooked up to like a

426
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,759
reservoir

427
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:06,639
what size reservoir would it be and how

428
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,039
does that work

429
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,000
the drip system i have is hooked up to

430
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,480
the main

431
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,480
spigot for the house like a house spigot

432
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,759
outside garden hose type

433
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,759
and from the spigot i use a 25 pressure

434
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,559
regulator 25 psi

435
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:24,480
pressure regulator a regular walmart

436
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,759
garden timer

437
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,039
and that goes to a water hose to

438
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:34,078
the um to a wide connector filter

439
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,559
like a 150 micron mesh filter and then

440
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,638
from there

441
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:41,198
it goes to the half inch hose

442
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,399
and that hose goes around in a loop in

443
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,879
the greenhouse

444
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,519
and then little quarter inch hoses go to

445
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:47,278
the plant

446
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,360
connected to four gallon per hour

447
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,720
drippers got it and then

448
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,560
how long did you say you had the time

449
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,680
how often does that timer come on

450
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,479
i turn it on 5 30 in the morning for 20

451
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,599
minutes

452
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,000
and then i know you have one

453
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,440
greenhouse with beds and then i've seen

454
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,159
in some of your videos you have grow

455
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,959
pots

456
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,000
as well and you're in soil what size

457
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:11,518
grow pots

458
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
are those plants in 10 gallons okay so

459
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,039
is it 10

460
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,120
gallons those are the fabric pots and

461
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,039
not the fabric ones i use the plastic

462
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,240
because

463
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:24,240
i'm always changing my mind so like beds

464
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,000
i think are the future for me

465
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,600
and i didn't want to get smart pots

466
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,078
spending 10 bucks a pot

467
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,720
that's like 600 bucks for 60 plants

468
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:35,679
where i could spend like 50 cent

469
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,560
and have um the same amount for way

470
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,958
cheaper

471
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,479
that makes sense and it works i don't

472
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,239
get any of those issues

473
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,079
a lot of people will say that the

474
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,360
plastic is going to get too hot the

475
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,519
roots are going to burn

476
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,560
things like that but i've never seen any

477
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,879
issue

478
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:53,039
like i said again it's a lot of sales a

479
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,120
lot of sales tactics

480
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,399
so for soil what type are you using is

481
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,679
there a particular brand you're using

482
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,159
are you creating your own mix

483
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,879
or what it depends on how you want to

484
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,039
work

485
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,240
if you want to live in soil you want to

486
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:06,838
amend your own soil

487
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,159
and do your own thing if you want to

488
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,600
feed

489
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,879
it really doesn't matter what soil like

490
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,639
what do you what are you worrying about

491
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,278
the soil for if you're going to be

492
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,600
feeding it

493
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:18,720
anyway because it's just the media to

494
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,519
hold the roots in

495
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,160
and keep the stalk strong right so i

496
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,879
just use a regular happy frog

497
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:28,958
for outdoor it's just simple got some

498
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,759
mycorrhizae in there to help start it

499
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,439
off right

500
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,600
and after starting off i'm going to be

501
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,800
feeding it so i didn't really worry

502
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,480
about that

503
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:41,120
now with the beds i got compost in there

504
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,079
i got um soil builder that has all the

505
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,120
feather mills

506
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:48,239
and chicken manure bat guanos

507
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,240
things like that in there but um as far

508
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,360
as really amending my own soil i haven't

509
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,720
done that yet

510
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,399
okay so it sounds like cooking if i'm

511
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,000
wrong it sounds like you're doing two

512
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,240
different things where you have

513
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,519
using synthetic bottled nutrients on one

514
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,399
greenhouse and then you're kind of doing

515
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,198
the living

516
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,679
soil organic in your beds is that

517
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:05,359
correct

518
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,959
yes wouldn't now what are you using for

519
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,038
the bottle nutrients

520
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,720
house and garden okay do you use their

521
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:12,400
complete lineup and do you follow their

522
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,078
feeding chart or do you

523
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,079
do a half dose or how do you do the

524
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,599
feedings i noticed a thousand

525
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,959
milliliters

526
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:23,119
per 55 gallon drum for a and b

527
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,880
the whole way through nice so no

528
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,000
additives no cal mag no silicone no

529
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,039
nothing no cal mac

530
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,759
um epsom salt

531
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:33,200
sometimes sometimes epsom salt but for

532
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,720
the most part it's just a

533
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,319
and b it works keep it simple

534
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,400
and i know on your living soil side of

535
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,879
things what are you using for nutrients

536
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
there

537
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,160
and then i know i know you're also doing

538
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,240
a cover crop as well i've seen

539
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,600
a video where it was just sprouting up

540
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,880
can you talk to us about what you'd use

541
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,719
for nutrients and then

542
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,840
kind of your cover crop and such the

543
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,798
living soil thing kind of got screwed up

544
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,879
i started it off like that but i ran

545
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:01,440
into a nitrogen deficiency

546
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,360
like a really bad one it just wasn't

547
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,519
getting any nitrogen

548
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,359
so i went to house and garden i had to

549
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:10,000
give it give it what it needed

550
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,439
and then they just perked up greened up

551
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,240
and i was like you know what

552
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,919
i'm gonna practice this next year on the

553
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,599
living soil side of things

554
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,520
i'm gonna go ahead and cover crop still

555
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,678
keep that healthy and

556
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,599
and cut it down and kind of just work

557
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,200
the soil a little bit for next year

558
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,839
but for now i'm just gonna go ahead and

559
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,000
keep the house and garden thing going

560
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,558
because

561
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,160
i can't waste time and you know i don't

562
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:33,839
want to waste a crop

563
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,679
that makes sense yeah gotta do what you

564
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,439
got to do right you do

565
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,798
and the cover crop i love it it's just

566
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,240
it just looks great

567
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:41,679
just looks like you're out in nature it

568
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,558
looks like a whole another world down

569
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,038
there

570
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,558
it's beautiful and what were you using

571
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,200
for cover crop did you say

572
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,960
it's a mix on amazon just like a five

573
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,038
pound bag of cover crop

574
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,279
like 20 bucks i just got a few of those

575
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:56,000
and sprinkled it got some clover in

576
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,558
there

577
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,679
a couple types of clover and other stuff

578
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:01,839
i don't remember

579
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,759
okay and you sprinkle that on at a

580
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:04,558
certain point or did you sprinkle it on

581
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,798
like

582
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,879
when the plant first sprouts do you wait

583
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,879
or what you're actually supposed to do

584
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,280
it a long time before

585
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,480
but i didn't i kind of sprinkled it on

586
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,119
after i um

587
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,558
planted and watered everything in and

588
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,279
then about a week or so

589
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,639
they start growing up i also got some

590
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:26,319
alyssum

591
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,960
flowers yarrow um

592
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:31,200
what else do i have in there uh two

593
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,558
types of yarrow actually

594
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,319
and i'm using that because i want to

595
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,678
start giving some beneficial

596
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,918
bugs and that'll help feed the bugs

597
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,840
so i'm trying to i'm not a professional

598
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,200
at the living soil thing i'm just trying

599
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:46,558
to figure it out

600
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,240
continuous improvement right you got to

601
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,639
keep on learning that's one thing i love

602
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,400
about gardening is there's just so many

603
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,559
different ways to do it yeah

604
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,840
and uh the continuous learning i mean

605
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:57,599
it's not like you're doing the same

606
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:58,959
thing over and over and over again right

607
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,558
it's always changing pushing yourself to

608
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,319
learn more yeah it's always changing

609
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,558
there's always something new

610
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:07,038
and what i'm starting to learn is like

611
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:10,960
when you look at gardening you look at

612
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:14,158
the planet earth it's always changing

613
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,319
there's wildfires there's

614
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,559
monsoons they got everything on this

615
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:21,759
planet but the plants still live

616
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:25,119
so just keep on trying new things and

617
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:27,359
figuring it out yep absolutely let's hop

618
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,839
over into environment so

619
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,599
with greenhouse growing you know it's

620
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,279
completely different from

621
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,359
uh growing indoors right i know you have

622
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,599
an indoor operation as well

623
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,199
you know indoors temperature humidity

624
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:39,519
can easily get out of control and

625
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,679
there's

626
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,599
pieces of equipment where you can put in

627
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,120
there to regulate

628
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,359
greenhouse is kind of going to be a

629
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,519
little different there let's go one by

630
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,678
one let's start with temperature so

631
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:53,200
in one of your recent videos i saw that

632
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,960
you don't even have a temperature gauge

633
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,440
on there because you feel like you can't

634
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,919
control it so let me ask you

635
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,440
how high have temperatures gotten do you

636
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,159
you don't have any type of cooling in

637
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,279
there at all

638
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,400
or no i don't um

639
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,519
in the 20 by 30s it's really like hotter

640
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,200
over there

641
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,960
and it's funny because it's not far away

642
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,919
from the 10 by 30

643
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,720
but it's like for some reason it gets

644
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,120
hot in there

645
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:23,919
it was up to like 107 one day

646
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,959
and the plants were happy they didn't

647
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,960
care about it

648
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,880
as long as the plants had water at the

649
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,600
roots they were fine

650
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,200
they were just fine nice yeah i mean

651
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,119
they're resilient they can take it right

652
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,640
they could take it i went to a friend's

653
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,079
house and

654
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,759
you could walk up close to his

655
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:40,879
greenhouse and you could just feel the

656
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:42,640
heat coming out

657
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,559
and i was like why don't he lift the

658
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,320
sides up what's wrong with them

659
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,960
and i get closer and i'm like i'm caught

660
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,439
going in there it was 122 degrees in

661
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,960
there

662
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:56,159
and the plants were just praying not

663
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,519
worried about a thing it's amazing

664
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,720
plant could take it wow and so you lift

665
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,158
up your sides right

666
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,000
i had to and it wasn't even for the

667
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,919
plants it was more like for me

668
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
just to make sure that they were getting

669
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,799
wind flow and things like that but they

670
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,640
never looked

671
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:16,158
bad you know so i think a lot of times

672
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,759
we do things for us

673
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,080
instead of the plant because the plant

674
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,158
can take it so just to kind of go back

675
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:24,879
you have that plastic that wraps

676
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,480
up and kind of up and around and over so

677
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,600
you're just basically lifting it up on

678
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,400
both sides

679
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:32,240
yeah so the sides when you have the four

680
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,280
by four the two by fours for your

681
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,480
support

682
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:39,440
you're screwing that that um fern strip

683
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,159
up at the top so it gives you the

684
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,200
bottoms

685
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:46,320
to roll up and just use a regular clamp

686
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,400
to keep it open something simple you

687
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:52,240
know this is simple greenhouse they have

688
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,880
way better automated systems it costs

689
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,599
20s and 30s or thousands of dollars but

690
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,799
just for this

691
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:01,279
it's really simple just lift it up

692
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:03,599
roll it up keep it tight put a clamp on

693
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,759
it and now your side's open

694
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,359
yeah sounds easy yeah and lifting it up

695
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,558
it's good to have that flexibility yeah

696
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:10,000
you can aerate

697
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:11,759
right i can imagine some people building

698
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,880
a greenhouse and not building that

699
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:14,158
flexibility into it

700
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,480
so then they're kind of scrooge in a

701
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,200
sense it's funny because i didn't at

702
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,159
first

703
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,480
i kept the size down and i figured that

704
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,320
the

705
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,400
that the openings on each end will

706
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,720
create a wind tunnel

707
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,960
but when it's not windy you got to open

708
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,440
those sides up

709
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,798
you have to that makes sense now in the

710
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,400
winter time

711
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,400
uh you know temperatures can get pretty

712
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,840
cold there do you do anything in regards

713
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,720
to do you have any like heating system

714
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,918
or anything or do you just let

715
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,759
oh you shut it down you don't even grow

716
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,880
in the greenhouse at all in wintertime

717
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:49,359
what months typically is that um

718
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,400
right when it's over like september

719
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:52,158
october

720
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,720
let's go ahead so with the with these

721
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,520
beds if i decide to keep the same

722
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,919
structures

723
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:59,278
which i might not because i noticed that

724
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,080
i'm losing

725
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,440
um a lot of square footage by having

726
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:06,000
three separate structures

727
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,240
instead of one large one it's a lot of

728
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,119
square footage that i could fill in

729
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,440
a lot of blank space so i might just

730
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:15,439
scratch the whole thing and start over

731
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,558
gotcha so utilizing space is a big thing

732
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,000
for you huh it's probably one of your

733
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:20,879
main goals to do is utilize

734
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,919
space well at first i like things to be

735
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,720
nice

736
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,919
and um you know i like nice lines i like

737
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,960
things to work right

738
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:32,000
i like one one

739
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,679
plant variety in each greenhouse

740
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,960
so i could have everything cohesive

741
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,640
so that's why i made three but now i'm

742
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,679
looking at i got owls down the

743
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,840
greenhouse

744
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,960
inside the greenhouse and around the

745
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,558
greenhouse

746
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:51,440
so let's cancel out the betweens and

747
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:52,639
insides and use all that space for

748
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,600
canopy

749
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,799
and just make one big structure make

750
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:59,359
sense

751
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:00,960
makes sense now what about humidity kind

752
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:01,759
of sticking on the environment thing

753
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,840
humidity

754
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,798
um are you doing it can't really do too

755
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,038
much

756
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,960
so whatever the humidity is outside it's

757
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:12,158
going to be inside

758
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,000
and humidity comes with rain right

759
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,200
so i'm not doing anything in the raining

760
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,038
season so

761
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,440
i never worry about it it's down to like

762
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:22,480
twenty percent

763
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,679
it's fine it's really weird

764
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,480
coming from indoor to greenhouse because

765
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,000
all those

766
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,720
all the people say 75 50. that's like a

767
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,159
norm

768
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,798
right for indoor and now with led lights

769
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,559
they're saying

770
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:41,918
82 84 65 70

771
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:44,480
humidity vpd and such i've seen the best

772
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:47,919
flower in the greenhouse

773
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:51,440
with total different numbers

774
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:54,400
i'm talking about 84 in the day 55

775
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,360
at night colors exploding out through

776
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,880
the buds

777
00:25:55,359 --> 00:26:02,000
fro you know what i mean everything

778
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,919
a lot of color a lot of color

779
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
i can imagine yep for sure now

780
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,360
when humidity gets high one of the

781
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,079
concerns and this can happen in a

782
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,439
greenhouse

783
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,278
i don't know if you've encountered it

784
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,640
before it's pottery mildew

785
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:16,319
have you encountered a pottery mildew at

786
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,200
all or

787
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,879
no nothing okay that's good no yeah

788
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,000
because it's not high in a greenhouse

789
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:27,120
well it it is it gets high for

790
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,558
i cover the greenhouse at 5 pm and i

791
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,439
uncover at

792
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:33,759
10 o'clock to induce flowering on

793
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,679
certain varieties

794
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:40,558
in that time it's humid and it's hot

795
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,519
in such a short time i don't see any

796
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:42,480
issues

797
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,000
and you also have plenty of air

798
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,640
circulation anyways i've seen your

799
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,240
videos

800
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,480
um can you talk a little bit about air

801
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:52,960
circulations how many fans you have

802
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:56,720
for that greenhouse i have four

803
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,200
and um and one and three in the rest

804
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,839
and it's enough airflow it's enough

805
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,840
airflow

806
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,079
you go in you can feel air movement

807
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:07,119
that's all that's really needed

808
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:09,359
just keep it up top you know keep that

809
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:10,399
keep that air circulation and then the

810
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:13,199
sides and the

811
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,798
other opposite ends they keep a nice

812
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,919
nice low vortex of wind

813
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:20,240
so that's great yeah it's so key

814
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,120
for sure now what about co2 anything for

815
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,038
co2 or

816
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:27,359
just outside co2 you can't do anything

817
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,599
because it's not a sealed space

818
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,439
it's never sealed if that greenhouse was

819
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:35,599
sealed you're talking about

820
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,440
160 degrees you can't do that

821
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:38,798
you know you can't do that yeah unless

822
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,200
you would have cooling and stuff like

823
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:42,000
that

824
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,720
but um yeah and that's a total different

825
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,159
structure

826
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,200
we're talking about way more

827
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,000
construction way more power

828
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,759
it's it's not difficult it's just a

829
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,278
totally different construction

830
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,440
cost will go through the roof right with

831
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:58,480
all the electricity consumption

832
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:02,798
no no you could use a swamp cooler

833
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:05,440
okay on one end enclosed

834
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,158
like uh like you put boards up create a

835
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,278
wall

836
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,760
put a swamp cooler there and have a

837
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,038
small

838
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:15,038
fan on the opposite end that just

839
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:17,839
makes the um cool air flow through the

840
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:19,759
greenhouse i thought about that too

841
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,959
you know i thought about a lot but it's

842
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:23,440
working simpler

843
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,960
without buying the expensive equipment

844
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,320
and things like that

845
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,159
cool let's switch it up and let's talk

846
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:29,759
about lighting so one of the benefits of

847
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,159
growing outdoors in a greenhouse is you

848
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,359
get

849
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,480
free lighting with the sun right

850
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:36,158
so you don't have to spend any money on

851
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,038
electricity consumption there which is a

852
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,960
good thing

853
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:40,879
i believe you're using supplemental

854
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,159
lighting as needed

855
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,039
can you talk to us a little bit about

856
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:48,000
what you use and when you use it

857
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:49,038
well when you want to extend the daytime

858
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,278
a few hours

859
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:53,599
maybe four hours in the beginning to

860
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:57,759
keep things in a vegetative state

861
00:28:53,599 --> 00:29:00,480
i just use these led strip lights

862
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:01,679
and they work they work pretty good and

863
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,720
i just use those

864
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,080
keep it on a timer and uh

865
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,079
that's it that's only for like a few

866
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,639
weeks after that

867
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,119
i'm just using the sun and the sun is

868
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,360
the best

869
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:14,398
if you have a par meter you know what i

870
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:18,479
mean

871
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:21,519
you go outside it's 1700 par

872
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,399
you know it's it's un it's unrivaled

873
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:25,440
you can't mess with it you can't

874
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:28,158
replicate it either

875
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,960
and it's like it's the best yeah and

876
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,080
when we're talking about the

877
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,720
supplemental lighting

878
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:34,079
uh you just a very small amount of light

879
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,640
is needed right you're not going to need

880
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:38,558
to

881
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,000
power you know 400 600 watts per 5x5 or

882
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:42,158
whatever um

883
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,679
you just need a small amount do you do

884
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,760
you know how many like watts

885
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,120
each of those led are any idea how much

886
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:50,640
oh those are only uh like

887
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:52,719
18 watts a piece it's nothing

888
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,000
and they're bright enough and the plants

889
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,399
will still

890
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,359
droop like their sleep but they're still

891
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:59,119
they're still

892
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,678
collecting that light and keeping it in

893
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:04,079
that in that vegetative state

894
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,159
so it works i know you said you have a

895
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:07,678
par meter do you have any idea how much

896
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,760
power that is just with the supplemental

897
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,320
lighting you know i never checked that

898
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,278
okay that would be interesting yeah it

899
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,839
would probably be around

900
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,558
i would think around 200 maybe 400 ppfd

901
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,158
at the most

902
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,079
probably not even that probably like a

903
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,278
t5 right like a t5

904
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:24,798
just like 200 that's it yep not light is

905
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:25,759
not a lot of light is needed for

906
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:28,480
supplemental lighting

907
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:30,879
that's cool it's not i see people with

908
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,640
kavitas inside and it's like

909
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:37,120
what are you doing overkill man

910
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,919
that's a lot of electricity yeah oh it

911
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,199
adds up

912
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,399
now how about light deprivation um

913
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,240
can you talk to us a little bit about

914
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:46,959
that what you do for that

915
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,480
that's simple that's what i mean by um

916
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,640
using a supplemental light

917
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,759
for a few hours when you're first

918
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,600
planting

919
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:55,119
you want the roots to expand through the

920
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:58,639
pot until

921
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,918
before you flower right so sun comes up

922
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,640
at six o'clock

923
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,159
this is just for hypothetical sun is up

924
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,200
at six

925
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,600
goes down around say it was going down

926
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,558
around

927
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:13,359
seven but you want to go veg so you need

928
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:16,079
five more hours to supplement a light

929
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:17,038
until 12. so that's your vegetative

930
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,038
state

931
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,759
now when you want to stop that you cut

932
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:26,000
off your supplemental lighting

933
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:28,798
and you tarp it i type at five

934
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,440
i type at 5 pm so i pull a black sheet

935
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:33,599
over

936
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:36,960
that's light proof leak light leak proof

937
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:38,798
um put that down over all the sides

938
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,240
put like some cinder blocks on it to

939
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:43,119
keep it down

940
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,240
and i'll keep that on until 10 at night

941
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:45,599
when it's

942
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,679
as dark as it's going to get for the

943
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,599
night uncover it

944
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,440
and let the sun wake the plants up in

945
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,240
the morning

946
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,440
so i use so i'm really at 13 hours of

947
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,798
darkness

948
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,240
gotcha now this black sheet uh

949
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,240
do you know what type of material is it

950
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,278
is it is actually a black tarp

951
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,919
or no it's just a six mil

952
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:10,079
black and white poly like the panda film

953
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,320
they got they got way better ones

954
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:14,000
because these rip a lot so next year i

955
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:16,319
would not be using them because the six

956
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,599
mill is just the cheapest set of bunch

957
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,759
and it's really probably made for um

958
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:22,959
just people that's doing it for a season

959
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:24,720
you know

960
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,720
and if you want to get more technical

961
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,798
this 14 mil woven

962
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,919
that will not rip at all but we're

963
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,278
talking about 1400 bucks a roll

964
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,399
you know but it's worth it when you

965
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:36,000
think about it if you're going to be

966
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:36,558
doing it it's worth getting the right

967
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,839
stuff

968
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:40,398
even the right clear plastic the same

969
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:42,398
thing

970
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:44,398
have you ever had any problems with kind

971
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:47,199
of doing that transition to where

972
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:47,678
plants turned into hermaphrodites or

973
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,519
anything

974
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,960
or if you messed up the light schedule

975
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,359
i'm just kind of wondering curious on

976
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,558
that

977
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:54,639
sounds like that would be something easy

978
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:57,200
to mess up on well

979
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,080
when you look at a par meter you will

980
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,798
see that

981
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:06,079
you can see and the par read like five

982
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:08,398
five compared to 1700

983
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:11,038
it's not going to affect it you see i

984
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:11,359
think the higher the the light intensity

985
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:14,398
is

986
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,798
during this daylight the more leeway you

987
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:17,918
have

988
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:18,720
for its night cycle you see what i'm

989
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,320
saying

990
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,159
i think it has a little more leeway but

991
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:23,278
like i said i'm not a scientist i'm just

992
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,760
knowing what i see

993
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:26,398
and i know i have rips in the plastic

994
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,119
sometimes

995
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:31,439
like little spots and nothing ever

996
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:34,000
happens

997
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,480
whereas indoor that might be an issue

998
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,159
yep

999
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,679
i know a common question i get all the

1000
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,480
time is like

1001
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,880
oh the moon has light and why don't

1002
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,399
plants continue to grow on the moonlight

1003
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,240
and stuff like that and it's like well

1004
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:46,719
it's not enough photons of energy it's

1005
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,120
not going to

1006
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,759
drop drive photosynthesis at all right

1007
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:51,199
so

1008
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,278
it's not that's uh that's what i'm

1009
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,798
saying like we could see but the plant

1010
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:57,440
doesn't absorb that

1011
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:58,480
light not that starlight or moonlight or

1012
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,440
nothing

1013
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,919
even like uh my neighbor has a bright

1014
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,919
light in his yard and i was scared of it

1015
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,559
because it's like so bright but it

1016
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,398
didn't it didn't register on a par meter

1017
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:11,759
it wasn't registering anything let's

1018
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:15,039
flip it up and let's talk about

1019
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,720
plant support so i know you do a couple

1020
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,679
different things to support so once the

1021
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,519
plants grow up big

1022
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,440
to a certain point they might have

1023
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:22,878
flowers on them they're so heavy that

1024
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,760
are going to kind of flop all over the

1025
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:24,878
place so

1026
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,520
can you talk to us a little bit about

1027
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:31,039
what you do for plant support

1028
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:33,440
well in the beginning in the beginning

1029
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,199
i just use a bamboo steak to hold them

1030
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,720
up and get their roots strong enough to

1031
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,799
hold yourself

1032
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,719
if i need it you know not all plants

1033
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,519
need it

1034
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,719
then after that just trellis trellis

1035
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:47,440
works

1036
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,039
and trellis is needed when you got a lot

1037
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,918
of plants you need trailers

1038
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:53,519
because that'd be a lot of bamboo and

1039
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,519
then you'll need to clip i use these

1040
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,199
orchid clips

1041
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:58,880
i don't have any here but i use these

1042
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:00,480
little orchid clips and just clip a

1043
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,400
stalk to the bamboo

1044
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,240
not the bottom stalk but like the top

1045
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,559
just clip it to the bamboo

1046
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:08,078
and that works great at what point are

1047
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:12,480
you adding in the steaks

1048
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:14,480
in the trellis too late always too late

1049
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,880
i'm always waiting to like week two a

1050
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,000
flower to add trellis and

1051
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,280
i should start off with trellis right

1052
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,838
over the canopy

1053
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,920
and then go into flour so it gets that

1054
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:26,719
support on all of it because i always

1055
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,960
start late

1056
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:30,480
i don't know why i was wrong with me but

1057
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,079
i gotta fix that

1058
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,480
are you doing any type of like plant

1059
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:38,079
training uh whether it be topping

1060
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,358
defoliation um leaf tucking

1061
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,160
lollipop anything like that or always

1062
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:44,639
lollipop

1063
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,559
i always clean up the bottoms um and i

1064
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:49,279
always top

1065
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:51,358
i just keep it simple and top i've been

1066
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,320
doing that for like six years

1067
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:55,119
just just top get about eight tops on

1068
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,320
there

1069
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:01,440
that's that's enough for me

1070
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,680
that's enough some people argue and say

1071
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,440
veg two weeks longer talk more and talk

1072
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:06,078
more and it's like two weeks is a long

1073
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,440
time

1074
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:12,320
i don't we're on schedule you know so

1075
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,760
no i'm gonna do it this way you gotta

1076
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,960
love back seat growers

1077
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,280
always somebody on their computer

1078
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,679
telling you how to grow your plants all

1079
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,599
day

1080
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:21,519
all day in the comments do this do this

1081
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,559
do this and i check their page and i'm

1082
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:24,960
like

1083
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:26,719
what are you doing you know leave me

1084
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,920
alone

1085
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:32,239
that's funny no two girls are alike

1086
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,920
you know everybody does it their way

1087
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,838
like outside

1088
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,599
i don't see the need for a full

1089
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:40,000
trellised canopy

1090
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,838
because the penetration of the sun is

1091
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,838
going to get down to the lowers

1092
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:49,679
and it's all going to be usable material

1093
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:52,480
in my opinion all right ipm

1094
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:53,440
and pest control so integrated pest

1095
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,320
management

1096
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,599
we probably should have talked about

1097
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,000
this first i feel like i always talk

1098
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,440
about this last at the podcast but

1099
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,639
really i mean this is one of the one of

1100
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,920
the more important things right

1101
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:02,559
especially when you're growing outdoors

1102
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,159
is

1103
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:05,279
these pests they can completely ruin

1104
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:06,319
your crop if you're not if you don't

1105
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,640
have things under control

1106
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,480
it's very important yeah and it's one of

1107
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:13,679
those things that um

1108
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,079
i lack on sometimes uh

1109
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,118
trying to be more preventative but it

1110
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,320
seems like

1111
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,680
a lot of products just don't work like a

1112
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,920
lot of stuff just

1113
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:24,719
especially with spider mites i don't

1114
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,039
know but

1115
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:27,838
the california spider mite will swim

1116
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,480
through

1117
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:31,279
almost all your products you have to be

1118
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,880
spraying

1119
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,280
diligently like every three days or

1120
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,920
even with the beneficials i didn't see

1121
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,000
any

1122
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:45,599
anything um really work

1123
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,519
so today no tomorrow tomorrow i'll be

1124
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,519
getting some green lace wings in

1125
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:52,159
green lace wing larva and that's what

1126
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:54,320
the lesson flowers are for

1127
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,480
because they'll eat that while they're

1128
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,960
staying around and getting to the

1129
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,159
into the mites or getting to the other

1130
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,920
pests

1131
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:03,440
so hopefully this works because i'm

1132
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,358
ordering 5 000

1133
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,639
and i've got it on a schedule to come

1134
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:08,960
every week

1135
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:09,679
so every week five thousand five

1136
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,480
thousand

1137
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:13,759
so hopefully this works because i tried

1138
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,838
to

1139
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,520
neil sillis californica's predator might

1140
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:21,920
i didn't see anything work

1141
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:23,358
it just didn't work so it's spider mites

1142
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,559
in particular that you're battling are

1143
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:27,679
there any other pests

1144
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,480
that you're a fits okay aphids i had

1145
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:31,440
aphids

1146
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,000
and i sprayed spinosad and i never seen

1147
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,039
an aphid

1148
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,760
again it was amazing i was like wow this

1149
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:38,079
really works

1150
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,440
and that was just a safer brand went in

1151
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,039
there sprayed it and they just

1152
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,358
disappeared

1153
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:44,239
i was like okay that works i got to keep

1154
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:46,960
that in the

1155
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,319
in the tuck yeah and i'm liking this

1156
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,119
take down spray

1157
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,160
from monterey take down spray that's

1158
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,599
working pretty good

1159
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,239
also and it leaves a nice little coat on

1160
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,838
your leaves

1161
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:01,598
a little shine so it's pretty good okay

1162
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:03,599
so those are some of the pests you've

1163
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,800
you've encountered and kind of how you

1164
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,960
battle them

1165
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,079
do you do anything in like the

1166
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,000
vegetative stage

1167
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,359
as like is that preventative at all are

1168
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,119
you doing like a neem oil

1169
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:18,400
are you doing anything uh any type i did

1170
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,920
i did neem oil i did sulfur i try to i

1171
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,680
try to mix everything up

1172
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,838
because i always have plants around so

1173
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:28,639
you know how plant you know how pets are

1174
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:32,480
they they

1175
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:32,480
they they leave like um

1176
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:36,879
kind of what's the word i'm looking for

1177
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,720
like they get immune to it

1178
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,800
over a while it builds up like a

1179
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:43,919
tolerance to it a tolerance yeah

1180
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,920
so kind of mixing it

1181
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,039
everything clean whatever you use just

1182
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,838
keep using it

1183
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:02,639
switch it up and just do it at least

1184
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:04,719
once a week

1185
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:06,639
at least once a week right when you

1186
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:10,000
think things are just perfect

1187
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:11,759
spray just do it and a lot of people say

1188
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,679
they don't spray they don't do this and

1189
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,200
it's like here's

1190
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:19,519
it's necessary it's very necessary

1191
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:21,118
just don't spray bad things you know

1192
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:22,400
don't spray the bad stuff

1193
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,318
yeah there have been times where i've

1194
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,000
been lazy on my outdoor garden my little

1195
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:27,920
vegetable garden i have i have a two

1196
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,679
foot by ten foot bed and

1197
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,039
uh you know when you miss the sprays and

1198
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:32,480
stuff i think i missed the spray like

1199
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:34,480
three or four weeks in a row

1200
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,920
and then and then we get all the way up

1201
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,760
to harvest time and i'm

1202
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,519
going into harvest and just loaded with

1203
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,319
aphids and i'm just like

1204
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:43,440
yeah the aphids suck because they look

1205
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:46,159
disgusting

1206
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,159
they just look disgusting it's like oh

1207
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:49,199
no you don't even want to touch it or be

1208
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,519
around it

1209
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:53,039
but yeah the spinner said spinoza works

1210
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:54,960
for the

1211
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:56,639
use the spinosad just once a week just

1212
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,559
use it i'm gonna have to try that out

1213
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:01,039
for sure i haven't used spinosad yet

1214
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:03,599
really yeah that's like yeah that's like

1215
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:05,920
a secret ingredient in a lot of things

1216
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,720
yeah that's great well i mostly grow

1217
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,960
indoors

1218
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:10,159
and yeah you don't really need much

1219
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,358
indoors you know as long as your

1220
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:12,960
environment's pretty clean and stuff

1221
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:14,559
like that and you take the precautions

1222
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,838
that not going directly from outdoors

1223
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:16,880
directly into your grow tent and stuff

1224
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:17,358
like that so you can kind of get away

1225
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,519
with

1226
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:20,400
not doing a lot of these ipm stuff i

1227
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:24,000
can't do that

1228
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,200
i can't i'm everywhere so yeah i just

1229
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,920
got to stay up on my

1230
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,639
my sprays and a lot of a lot of times

1231
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,920
you'll pick up

1232
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:34,960
problems from your garden supply also

1233
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,800
so you got to be careful with that

1234
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,559
you know that's a good point yeah that's

1235
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,240
a really good point a lot of people

1236
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:41,838
a lot of people going to that garden

1237
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:45,118
supply dropping their

1238
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:48,880
issues off right there so

1239
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,280
be careful amazon you know just order it

1240
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,240
come to your door and just just do it

1241
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,560
like that

1242
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,719
all right so we went over quite a bit

1243
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:58,078
today couple final questions

1244
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:59,519
there are a lot of people who are just

1245
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,880
getting started with greenhouse growing

1246
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:02,159
and i imagine that there are people

1247
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,720
clicking on this

1248
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:06,078
this podcast episode and they're a

1249
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:08,639
beginner they're looking for

1250
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,920
advice what advice would you have for

1251
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,879
somebody who's kind of just

1252
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,880
starting out greenhouse growing for a

1253
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,519
greenhouse i get a lot of dms

1254
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,760
all the time about questions about the

1255
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:22,079
greenhouse

1256
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,359
don't overthink it just build the

1257
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,200
structure

1258
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:26,799
and think about what could go wrong

1259
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:30,318
while you're building it

1260
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:34,079
for say like you're using pvc

1261
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:35,039
without a center beam it might collapse

1262
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,400
on you

1263
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:39,119
you never know pvc is hard but it might

1264
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,400
collapse

1265
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:47,039
so use one inch pvc you know

1266
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:49,200
make it thicker um cemented in

1267
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:50,800
siemens your boards in your support

1268
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:54,159
boards

1269
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,079
um and that's about

1270
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:58,159
it because you can get away with doing

1271
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:01,280
the cheapest greenhouse ever

1272
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:02,078
it'll work you know it'll work but if

1273
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,920
you want to be

1274
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,760
if you want to be in it for the long run

1275
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,000
just go ahead and spend

1276
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,200
the right amount of money for the right

1277
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,318
items

1278
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:14,000
and just and just do some research

1279
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:16,159
and look at the new look at the new

1280
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,400
greenhouses that are built with steel

1281
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:20,239
and try to replicate that that's what i

1282
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,318
would say try to replicate that

1283
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:23,279
purlins you know what i mean just go all

1284
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:25,440
out

1285
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,720
but if you can't buy a cheap greenhouse

1286
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,119
from amazon

1287
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:30,719
and that's the best starter that's your

1288
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,800
best start right there

1289
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:36,399
steel structure vented roll-up door

1290
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,800
you know that's your best that's your

1291
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,559
best bet i think that's some good advice

1292
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,160
yeah for sure

1293
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,000
so where can the listeners find you and

1294
