00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:33,000
gardening yeah so um my name is Luke and

99
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,639
um I've been around gardening my whole

100
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,840
life I always felt like I had a green

101
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,479
thumb my mom was always in the garden in

102
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,039
the backyard making compost and just

103
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:43,199
watching her flip the pile and see the

104
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:47,120
steam come off was just it was crazy to

105
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:49,759
see and um as I got older uh you know he

106
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,519
had to find a job so I I got into

107
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:56,158
landscaping and I did that for for

108
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:58,599
several years and um my daughter I had a

109
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:01,000
daughter pretty young I was about 20 and

110
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:04,158
she was diagnosed with spinabifida and

111
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,360
hydris and I won't go too deep into that

112
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:09,280
but uh that kind of was like okay what

113
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,519
can I do all for alternative medicine

114
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,158
because they want to give her this this

115
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:16,959
that and the other thing and I just I'm

116
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:19,478
not a big um pill guy I don't I'm I

117
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,560
think there's other alternative sources

118
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:23,758
so I started doing my research and and

119
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,280
that's when I came across um your

120
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,439
channel and uh Jeremy's channel to build

121
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:31,319
a soil and I started reading more about

122
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:34,680
gardening and it was just a a pipe dream

123
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,560
at this time um I lived in Indiana and I

124
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,840
had a really good job and I travel for

125
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,600
work non-stop I still work there my mom

126
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:45,679
um few years later she passed of cancer

127
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,320
and she was always a big green head so I

128
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,400
I me and my buddy Matt uh we grew up in

129
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,478
diapers together um we just came up with

130
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,959
a plan we said you know what we're going

131
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,879
to move to Michigan we're going to do it

132
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:59,159
we're going to uh start our own CBD

133
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:00,240
company um CBN uh start learning how to

134
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,759
garden

135
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,918
and so we both moved to Michigan I moved

136
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,439
uh about a year and a half ago and uh

137
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:11,279
Matt followed me about 6 months later

138
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:12,879
and we just dou full head in we went AC

139
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,000
Infinity I mean we bought everything we

140
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,719
could we probably overdid a little bit

141
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,240
but we wanted to do it right we it

142
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,080
wasn't just um growing the medicinal

143
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,560
plant we wanted more we wanted to start

144
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:26,918
our own thing and um we did we just

145
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,079
fullon went at it and uh I tried the

146
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:31,318
synthetic for a while it didn't go so

147
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,519
well just cuz the traveling for work and

148
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,160
you know staying up on top of the ph and

149
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,198
you know the watering and the runoff and

150
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,520
so then I started switching to Organics

151
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,639
and um I think Jeremy for his 10x10

152
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:44,599
Channel it changed the way I grow and

153
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,960
how I think about life in general so

154
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,639
would you say your style of gardening is

155
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,519
fully organic are you indoors only are

156
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,360
you doing Outdoors as well and are you

157
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:57,758
in soil or cocoa or what I'm an indoor

158
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,520
grower um like I'm in Michigan so it's a

159
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,919
little cold over here most of the year

160
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:05,918
uh um but I'm a fully organic goer um I

161
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:08,198
did the followed the build the sway path

162
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,159
to the fullest um I love what they're

163
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:13,240
doing over there it just for me I needed

164
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,960
more hands-off gardening and uh with the

165
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,000
Organics and the larger volumes of soil

166
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:22,758
which I have um two 60 Gall beds and a

167
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,399
30 gallon so it allows watering to I can

168
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,000
space it out a little more and get away

169
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,399
with um a little bit less yeah and

170
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,199
Organics is really what I want to get

171
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:33,159
into today with you you know you look at

172
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:36,360
your Instagram and it's just fully

173
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,360
organic and you see very healthy plants

174
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,000
and I think that's a great topic for

175
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,439
today which is organic gardening keeping

176
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,160
plants healthy easier said than done

177
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,800
right I know when I first started

178
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,919
growing Organics I didn't know that you

179
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,400
had to keep the soil moist the entire

180
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,839
time in order for that proper Amendment

181
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:55,918
breakdown I wasn't told that I was told

182
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,719
hey add this fertilizer top dress just

183
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,918
water it in you're good to go so I was

184
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,520
still doing dry backs but between

185
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,560
waterings and found out that was a big

186
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,478
no no I had deficiencies on the plants

187
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,519
and there are little things like that

188
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:10,279
that you really have to abide by in

189
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:12,399
order to make sure that your plants are

190
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:13,799
healthy when growing with Organic inputs

191
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,758
and so we're going to get into all of

192
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,240
those things in this episode I do want

193
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,759
to start with container size because you

194
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,000
mentioned you're in 260 gallons and then

195
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:28,199
you're in 130 Gall so larger containers

196
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,560
are they fabric pots are they plastic or

197
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,720
or what type of containers are they yeah

198
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,800
they're the Grassroots fabric props it

199
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,199
allows for breathing it's got that liner

200
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,360
down at the bottom um so you don't get

201
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,960
so much runoff um it's been great to me

202
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,080
having the larger volume of soil you're

203
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,918
able to have a bigger buffer you're not

204
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:49,598
worrying about pH you know you can

205
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,918
follow a schedule you cannot you can

206
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:54,839
water only with that size and starting

207
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:57,639
with a balanced recipe is the key is

208
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:00,119
balance um then you can go less is more

209
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:02,079
you know like me I I travel for work so

210
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,158
I don't do nothing but water only during

211
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:07,478
the week and on the weekends I'll give

212
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:09,240
it a treat or something and because I'm

213
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,158
in that larger volume of soil I can get

214
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,759
away with that as long as the moisture

215
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:17,478
is at the right level then I do cheat I

216
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,439
use the Eco um sorom meter so it kind of

217
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:21,079
gives me reads of my phone so I can

218
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,839
relay to the wife you know hey we need

219
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:25,038
to water tonight and so on and so forth

220
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,638
yeah it's often said that being in a

221
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,199
larger container is easier when growing

222
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:32,080
with Organic inputs I personally start

223
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,240
out in a actually I tried it in a three

224
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,038
gallon and 5 gallon and even put it in

225
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,038
one gallon before and just to try it and

226
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,240
get some experience and see that it is a

227
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,639
little bit more challenging than it is

228
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,879
growing in a seven gallon or 10 gallon

229
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:49,159
is what I'm in now I've got a a couple

230
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,600
beds actually I've got a 2x10 bed Out

231
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:53,399
outdoors I grow my vegetables in the

232
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,519
same exact living soil one that you have

233
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,278
from grassers fabc pot those ones are

234
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,120
awesome I've got a bed that I'm getting

235
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:02,039
launched up here it's a 2X by4 for the

236
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,959
2x4 grow tent bed I'm not sure how many

237
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:07,399
gallons are in there now the you said 30

238
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:11,278
gallons is that the one that's in your

239
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:13,799
4x4 but is actually a 3X3 bed uh no the

240
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:16,958
30 gallon I have in my 3x3 tent and it's

241
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:20,159
just around um 30 gallon pot and then I

242
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:22,319
got the two 5x 510 when I got the 3X3

243
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,639
grassroot beds in them and those are the

244
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,079
60 gallon the 3X3 and then for your soil

245
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,958
mix right what's in it like what did you

246
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:32,559
do to begin

247
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:34,159
uh well I I kind of cheated again I went

248
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,799
straight through bis oil and I got their

249
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,559
take and bake recipe I said if I'm going

250
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:40,159
to do this you know not knowing much

251
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:43,039
about Organics at all you know I thought

252
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,679
just kind of learn as I go um so I got

253
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:47,319
the best Balan recipes and that's what

254
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:50,559
I've learned from watching the YouTube

255
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:54,160
series and um it's it's great it's it's

256
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,639
class mots mix the artasian soil um it's

257
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,799
it's got everything in it your your

258
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:02,439
Iration it's the one: one to one ratio

259
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:06,359
your your base your compost and your

260
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:11,200
ariation so it's got worm castings in it

261
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:16,759
um biochar with root wise inoculated um

262
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:19,000
it's got pmus rice holes um spum Pete

263
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:20,399
Moss and that was where I struggled too

264
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,078
was the spum Pete Moss because it's

265
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,679
hydrophobic and I I just gave this thing

266
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:27,719
this much water how is it still thirsty

267
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,159
so that was a struggle there so you said

268
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,399
it's a Take and Bake Mix which is cladis

269
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:36,439
cot 1 to one: one so you've got your one

270
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:38,919
part Pete you're using for the Iration

271
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,240
you're using both pmus and rice holes

272
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:43,360
and then you've got everything else worm

273
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,919
castings by ochar like you mentioned so

274
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,480
pretty straightforward there and how

275
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,519
long does that lasts you right so you

276
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,560
got to imagine that there's some

277
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,480
nutrition in there actually is there any

278
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,518
other additional amendments in there as

279
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,879
well for fertilizer yeah there's um it's

280
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:59,039
the build of soil mineral kit it's got

281
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:02,679
like your basol and oyster shell um and

282
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:06,799
then the clamus cots um nutrients so

283
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:10,958
what he used in his the kelp the cran um

284
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:12,879
so yeah it's for the first uh run I did

285
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,479
I only would give it you know some I

286
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,600
gave it some root wise at the beginning

287
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,720
and then I would give it some ferments

288
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,920
or I threw in your guys's stash blend um

289
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,079
I mean I didn't have any issues I'm on

290
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:28,919
my second run now and I'm about week six

291
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:31,799
of flour and I've did the same thing I

292
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:33,679
didn't well I re amended my fault I did

293
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,679
re amend after that first run which is

294
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,799
the build soil way I didn't do no soil

295
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:41,599
test I gave it your compo or your

296
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:43,838
compost build a flower uh worm castings

297
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,480
and that pretty much planted right into

298
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,760
that started again and now I'm in week

299
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,519
six of flour and just given it treats on

300
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,600
the weekend and it's

301
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,278
crushing so when I did break down an

302
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,639
order of soil test I think I am going to

303
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,399
get one after the second run just to

304
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,680
make sure you know my I haven't tested

305
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,879
my water so I don't know if I have a

306
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:02,799
sodium build build up or you know just

307
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:05,559
to kind of learn the whole process and

308
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,919
how you go amending um which is cool

309
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,719
that they offer this now they have

310
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:12,399
consultant so you can meet with the soil

311
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,399
doctor or um Zack Branson and actually

312
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,919
work with them and kind of figure out

313
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,720
what the soil test is saying because

314
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:21,240
I've looked them up online and they are

315
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,199
they're beyond me they are they are

316
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,759
they're in depth definitely they have a

317
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:27,039
ton of knowledge I actually met the so

318
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:29,958
Dr Bryant Mason at the soil Summit not

319
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,958
too long ago great guy and he has a ton

320
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,559
of knowledge so soil testing super

321
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,078
important water testing is another thing

322
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:36,559
that isn't really talked about enough

323
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:40,078
and we're going to get into water here

324
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:41,879
in a little bit but as far as your when

325
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,159
you put in that initial Take and Bake

326
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,720
eventually the nutrients are going to

327
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:47,439
deplete right so when do you put in your

328
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,360
first feeding and what does it consist

329
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,880
of um I stick with the craft blend the

330
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,360
352 um that's just I think it's 15 of

331
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:58,078
their favorite ingredients that they

332
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,879
made work and allinone and that's pretty

333
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,278
much it you know as far as top dressing

334
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,360
I do craft blend um if I do a

335
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:06,078
defoliation or a chop and drop I'll

336
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,839
throw some Kashi blend on there with

337
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:11,319
there just a a compost accelerator kind

338
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:13,800
of get everything active and going but

339
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,278
um as far as feedings I just stick to

340
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:18,679
the ferments um I do give a little bit

341
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:20,559
of build-a Bloom um in the middle of

342
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:23,799
flour which is a water soluble I just

343
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:26,919
mix in the shape in and water in um it's

344
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:29,359
got amino acids and um really built on

345
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:32,278
getting calcium phosphorus and potassium

346
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,800
uh available so but other than feedings

347
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:37,320
I really don't do much I do the re amend

348
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:40,159
water treats on weekend and and that's

349
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,120
it and so far I've had luck that's why I

350
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,159
think I'm going to get a soral test

351
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,679
where I get too deep and realize oh man

352
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:47,039
I just depleted everything CU Jeremy

353
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,198
does talk about you know feeding the

354
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,958
whole buffet and letting the plant do

355
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:52,679
what it's want never let it run out and

356
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,638
kind of stay up on top of that balance

357
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:57,359
so balances everything when it comes to

358
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,680
these when organic beds it really is

359
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,519
yeah I've been using the craft plan for

360
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:04,159
several years and that's an awesome mix

361
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,560
to be able to just use that I top test

362
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,278
every 30 days do you is it every 30 days

363
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,000
you typically doing it kind of according

364
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:11,679
to the instructions or you doing

365
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,879
something else in regards to the top

366
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,919
trusting of craft plan and other

367
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:17,480
amendments well I mean I really don't

368
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,399
have a schedule I think that's one thing

369
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,560
that Drew me from synthetic to organic

370
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,600
was you know you see Jeremy dumping the

371
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:25,319
the you know whatever he's feeding it in

372
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,278
his hand he's not even measuring it he's

373
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,079
just going for it and that's kind of

374
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:32,919
been my mentality I I I don't top dress

375
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:35,479
at all during my grow I uh simply just

376
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:37,559
water only for the most part and then re

377
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,839
amend you know accordingly watch the

378
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:42,758
plant which it stayed green the whole

379
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,839
time so it didn't tell me nothing um so

380
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:46,919
I kind of just you know watched a little

381
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:49,240
more content videos from you guys and

382
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:52,120
kind of made my own balance recipe and

383
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,600
re amended that and so far so good that

384
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,799
that's awesome sounds like uh was pretty

385
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,560
hands off or a little bit easier than it

386
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:01,679
is working with synthetics where you're

387
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:03,838
mixing up nutrients different formula

388
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,799
every week often times it's easier to

389
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,440
just go water only a lot of the times

390
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:09,319
here with the through Organics it sounds

391
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,480
like that's what you did for for last

392
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,879
grow and and this grow yes yep and even

393
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,600
when I ran the chill out OG in the uh 7

394
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:21,078
gallons it was just build aaur 3.0 and I

395
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,120
watered only and you know added some

396
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:25,479
things on the weekends and they

397
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,639
flourished so I'm I'm very excited to

398
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,639
see them in the 3X3 bed that's awesome

399
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,318
you have these soil mixes that are out

400
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,480
there that are water only just makes it

401
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:36,159
so much easier it really does so let's

402
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,480
back up to water water source we talked

403
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,159
about a little bit about how important

404
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,319
it is how you know a lot of people I

405
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:45,799
don't say neglect but they just don't

406
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:47,120
pay attention to as much as really they

407
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:49,559
should what are you using for a water

408
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,318
source are you do using tap water well

409
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:54,758
water are you filtering your water

410
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:58,240
reverse osmosis what's your water source

411
00:15:54,759 --> 00:16:01,039
um well for my first grow um in the big

412
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,318
beds I would just water out of I had I

413
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,719
ran a hose luckily I have a wash tub

414
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:06,278
down in my basement which is game

415
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,959
changer to be able to wash stuff out

416
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:10,720
that there but I ran my hose over to my

417
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,078
grow room so I got just a it and

418
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,879
I'd fill my buckets up I had two five

419
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:19,359
gallon buckets and um I let them sit

420
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:21,078
over 24 hours just to declinate and you

421
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,079
see if I could rid of anything over that

422
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:25,159
small amound of time and I really didn't

423
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:28,479
know I was just guessing and I'd water

424
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:30,559
the plants and and it crushed but that

425
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,039
recipe is so solid that I think I could

426
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,119
have thrown anything at it and it would

427
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:36,278
have been fine for the time being long

428
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,919
duration maybe not so so I finally broke

429
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:40,759
down and I got a just an RV filter

430
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:42,159
something I think they siphon out of uh

431
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,318
when they pull it out of the lake or

432
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,399
what have you it I'm not sure how they

433
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:49,439
do it but it's just a a filter that I

434
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,759
plug into my hose and it takes the small

435
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,040
um materials out that I don't want maybe

436
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:55,440
um but I think a water test is

437
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:58,120
definitely going to be the way to go

438
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,959
just to reassure what I got is going on

439
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,879
is good yeah it can be helpful I can't

440
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:07,078
even use my tap water here because uh

441
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:09,919
too much sodium sodium bicarbonates

442
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:12,318
comes in a very high pH it's just not

443
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,679
good for plants at all I've tried using

444
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,399
it before but unfortunately what it

445
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:18,400
leads to is deficient plants you know

446
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,880
you have too much sodium in the medium

447
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,959
causes lockouts of other nutrients being

448
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,520
uptaken and uh it's just it's not good

449
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,318
so I use reverse osmosis and I've been

450
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:31,079
using that and I know lot of some people

451
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:34,720
hate the fact that reverse osmosis is

452
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:37,439
used because of the Water waste right

453
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,120
some of these systems are 3 to one

454
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,279
basically for every gallon you're

455
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,639
wasting three gallons of water now

456
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,558
that's not every single system I don't

457
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,600
think a lot of people know this but I

458
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,480
actually just recently upgraded my RO

459
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:52,159
system to the uh and I pulled it up here

460
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:56,558
it's Apec Ro es-100 it's the essence

461
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,320
series and it's a 1: one ratio so it's

462
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:01,158
uh for every gallon of water you're only

463
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,439
wasting a a gallon of water technolog is

464
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:04,919
getting better when it comes to

465
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,798
filtering and or reverse osmosis it's

466
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,600
important to start with clean water

467
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:10,599
really because you can can run into

468
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:13,199
issues for sure I've ran into issues in

469
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:15,558
the past some people use well water

470
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,880
which uh you know if you get a a test on

471
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:18,279
there some of the well water comes in

472
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,400
high iron but it really depends on where

473
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:22,279
you live it's just there's so many

474
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,360
different areas that could come out with

475
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:26,599
different things in the water it's hard

476
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,000
to give blanket answers whether or not

477
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:29,959
some of these water sources can be used

478
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,400
or not same thing a tap you know whether

479
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,880
or not you can use it but anyways I'm

480
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,280
rambling on um a good topic water can

481
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,000
change everything absolutely right yeah

482
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:41,879
kind of relating to this is the moisture

483
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,159
content in the medium right so using

484
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,840
your your water you're Watering your

485
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:48,080
plants how do you monitor the moisture

486
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,519
content you mentioned the Eco wit is

487
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,279
that you're using yeah yeah it's an Eco

488
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:54,599
wit um I didn't start that I kind of

489
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:56,720
just did the whole bsur method slap the

490
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,439
bed and see if there's weight down there

491
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,919
kind of maybe move my cover crop a

492
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,679
little bit and see if there's moisture

493
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,559
on top um but then like I said I

494
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:06,400
traveled so much for work and and I

495
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:07,839
wasn't about to ask the wife to take

496
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,600
care of the three kids and go down here

497
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,798
and do these steps so um I saw the Eco

498
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,480
and I went ahead and bought them for all

499
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:16,319
my beds just for as a reinsurance and

500
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,120
makes my practicing better you know cuz

501
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,678
then I can use my gut and not rely on

502
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:23,359
that so much like okay maybe my gut was

503
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,960
right um so it really is a game changer

504
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:28,240
for me um you know it just goes to show

505
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,919
that the technology is so Advanced now

506
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,400
that you don't even have to be home and

507
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,159
you can grow plants as long as you have

508
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,919
you know a partner or somebody that can

509
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:38,480
help you along the way that's awesome

510
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,960
now are you hand watering or you do have

511
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,640
an auto watering system going or what

512
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,679
well I I'm kind of doing both right now

513
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,759
I did the blue mat when I was running

514
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:49,120
synthetic and I don't think I had it

515
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:50,960
dialed in properly three of the plants

516
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,199
went good the other three didn't go so

517
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,759
good and I'm pretty sure it was a

518
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,038
moisture reason or maybe I got a bubble

519
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,000
in the censer the carrot um so now with

520
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,279
the bigger beds um which I thought about

521
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,200
going blue soap but they're just uh

522
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:07,038
watered in hand that with a chapen I

523
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,519
water those in and uh the 30 gallon that

524
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:12,480
I have in the 3X3 tent it's a blue mat

525
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,519
for the and I got it set up properly cuz

526
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,839
she's healthy she's happy the reservoir

527
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:19,319
is going down and it's been awesome so I

528
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:21,158
kind of been experimenting with the blue

529
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:23,000
mat now that I kind of know more about

530
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:25,360
what I'm doing and what I'm looking for

531
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,119
and that's where the ecoi came in handy

532
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,240
too because that first watering can be

533
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,038
everything if you don't have that

534
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,880
moisture right you're setting yourself

535
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:35,319
up for failure so I think that was went

536
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,960
a long way with me you know being newer

537
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:39,558
to Growing that uh helped me to have

538
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,120
that little cheat to get the moisture

539
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:42,639
right and then realize okay this is what

540
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,719
it should feel like this is when I

541
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,440
should probably water at this stage so

542
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,839
the blue mat is definitely handy and

543
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,960
like I said I think eventually I'll try

544
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:53,038
to get a blue soak on the beds just cuz

545
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,400
I travel so much and take a little more

546
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,400
off the wife and maybe water some stuff

547
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,600
in on the weekends I love blue mats it

548
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,159
makes things so much e easier as far as

549
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,199
dialing in that moisture level I mean

550
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:05,240
you don't even need a moisture meter if

551
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,679
you have a blue matat system as long as

552
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,278
you uh have that guess to begin that you

553
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:12,840
think the moisture level is good you

554
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:14,558
right like you said if it's too moist

555
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:16,839
and you add in that blue mat could lead

556
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,480
to overwatering symptoms and so on and

557
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:21,119
so forth but if you add in that blue mat

558
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,000
system at the perfect moisture level it

559
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,798
just maintains it and makes things so

560
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,159
much easier so yeah I love blue mats I

561
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,480
speak about them too much actually well

562
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,039
they are there for the little technology

563
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,360
that's involved it's you know it's

564
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:38,000
there's no plugging nothing in and uh it

565
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:40,199
it is there it's a great system I need

566
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,079
to get some of them caps cuz I now with

567
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,919
the cover crop and everything growing up

568
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,798
it's I don't see nothing so when I go in

569
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,919
there to kind of maybe chop and drop I'm

570
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:49,440
worried I'm going to hit that little

571
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,759
nozzle and you know mess up my settings

572
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,519
so I'm definitely going to get one of

573
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:55,119
those how about compost teas I know a

574
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:57,960
lot of people use those when they're

575
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:00,079
growing with Organic inputs do you do

576
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,400
compost te it all if so how do you use

577
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:06,759
them I do I don't know if I'm doing it

578
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,720
right um I very rarely do do them um

579
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:10,519
when I when you guys came out with your

580
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,120
stash blend and you you know were kind

581
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:14,879
of advocate that you know this will be a

582
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:16,558
good tea um I started doing that and

583
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,240
that's all I really did was some

584
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,839
molasses um my R your stash blend every

585
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,200
once in a while maybe some craft blend

586
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:27,399
and some worm castings and I'd bubble it

587
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,480
for 12 to 24 hours and I that went so

588
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,120
both ways as far hours timing you know

589
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,960
some people went 48 Hours some people

590
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:35,359
said don't go past 12 so it was kind of

591
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,798
I didn't want to feed something I didn't

592
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,839
know what I was doing uh so far so good

593
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,558
and I would love to you know dig in more

594
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:43,240
on te's and because I do think they're

595
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:46,759
beneficial you know it's making things

596
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:50,960
readily available um making you know

597
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:53,240
giving the sugars to the microbes and um

598
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,200
not necessarily you know that sweet spot

599
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,599
to where you don't just have one microbe

600
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,960
you know you're dominant taking out the

601
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,918
other you want that sweet spot to where

602
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,880
you're getting a little little bit of

603
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,320
everything the diversity so learn I want

604
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,880
to learn more about that and definitely

605
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:06,879
get more into teas yeah they can

606
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,440
certainly be beneficial and there's I

607
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,840
agree there a lot of misinformation or a

608
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,919
lot of conflicting information I guess

609
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:14,959
you could say where how long you should

610
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:17,120
Brew for how much Iration needs to

611
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,240
happen and so on and so forth we won't

612
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:22,079
get too deep into compost teas here but

613
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,000
I do have other episodes where people

614
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,038
dive deep into compost teas and really

615
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,079
break it down what they do when they're

616
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:29,960
Brewing teas how they brew their teas

617
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:32,519
and so and so forth now you talked about

618
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,840
sugars a little bit microbial inoculant

619
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:36,558
can you kind of break down how you're

620
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,678
using those things uh well the inoculant

621
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:41,158
like I said I'm using the root Rise um

622
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:43,320
micro complete the bofos and the enzyme

623
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:46,400
Elixir to kind of bring those out of

624
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:47,918
dormy um but that's as far as inoculates

625
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,960
I'm not really getting too far into the

626
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,400
sugars it's still a lot to be learned

627
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,600
obviously um you know my understanding

628
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,600
of sugars is you know they are essential

629
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,240
but they're not a necessity maybe not

630
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:00,399
towards the end of flour and I could be

631
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,319
wrong wrong on that um that they do use

632
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,798
more sugars for resin production um but

633
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:06,960
like I said I wouldn't quote me on that

634
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,558
I'm not sure completely I'm still a

635
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,000
rookie when it comes to you guys so I'm

636
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:13,440
taking a little bit of time and trying

637
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,278
not to overwhelm myself cuz Organics

638
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,400
when I first saw it was like there is no

639
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:20,240
way there's no way I can do this and you

640
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,000
just get started and you know you learn

641
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,359
as you go and so starting with the right

642
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,519
formulas and the right you know Guidance

643
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:30,719
the Mr grows and the jermies and you

644
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:32,798
know so it's been a big help watching

645
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,679
you guys cuz otherwise it's just Google

646
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,960
and you know I was back in Indiana

647
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,759
trying to um just learn about the stuff

648
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,880
and I had a VPN I was so scared so no

649
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,960
one could track me so it's been awesome

650
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,840
to learn from everybody yeah and with

651
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,319
the sugars and microbi knul a lot of

652
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:48,918
people say hey that's kind of an

653
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,798
optional thing you know you don't need

654
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,600
to go out and buy these products and add

655
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:55,440
them in you can totally get away with

656
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:58,798
just top dressing craft blend for

657
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,558
example just a a fertilizer blend that

658
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,359
have all natural organic inputs you

659
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:05,158
could totally just get away with that

660
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,678
and then water and that's it you don't

661
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:10,159
even need to do mulch layers or cover

662
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,840
crops uh but a lot of people do because

663
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,440
it helps with growth right mulch layers

664
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:16,439
cover crops break down what you're doing

665
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,440
for those

666
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,759
things um I do I do the straw mulch I

667
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,880
did the barley straw uh the blue oyster

668
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:26,558
I started off with that and then I just

669
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,919
went to Ace and started getting some

670
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:32,398
regular straw uh I do use the 12 seeve

671
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,159
cover crop from builda soil which that

672
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:37,119
stuff's amazing there's so much in there

673
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,520
different clovers and flax and U that

674
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:42,038
stuff's gorgeous to grow I that um

675
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:44,359
picture that we had in your book and I

676
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:46,359
had some some layovers so I just had

677
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:47,959
cover crop growing it just exploded and

678
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:50,719
there's so much Beauty in it it was

679
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,960
awesome to see um but I really do think

680
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,159
it helps you know protect that

681
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,600
rizosphere the top few inches of that

682
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,840
soil you know helps spread moisture um

683
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,719
throughout the

684
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:04,759
um bed the cover crop is huge when it

685
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,960
comes to um spreading the moisture cuz

686
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:09,519
even if you know you get give too much

687
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,159
water you have all those little clovers

688
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:13,440
drinking up the water to kind of help

689
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:15,480
you out and if you're underwater you can

690
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,640
kind of see it in your cover crop maybe

691
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,599
before your cash crop so I've kind of

692
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,880
used that as my moisture cheater too you

693
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,719
know if the top inch is you know nice

694
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,080
and moist I'm pretty sure the blow layer

695
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,000
is going to be pretty good so I'm a bit

696
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:31,439
advocate of mulch and and STW and

697
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,240
whatever you can get to cover it up and

698
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,558
keep the worms happy and let them come

699
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:39,000
up and take your your nutrients and down

700
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:41,599
to them and feed everything so it's it's

701
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,558
definitely um I I would definitely say

702
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:46,000
do straw and mulch I agree those things

703
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:48,599
are just so helpful particularly for me

704
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,159
living in such a dry climate you know my

705
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:55,278
natural humidity I got to right there

706
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:57,440
actually 24% oh wow 24% RH is what it is

707
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,319
right here and then my grow room is the

708
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,399
next room over here here so I'm always

709
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:05,158
adding in humidity and being in such a

710
00:27:02,398 --> 00:27:07,239
dry climate the medium dries out very

711
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:08,320
quickly it can dry out a lot faster

712
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,079
particularly if you have you know the

713
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:15,079
lights on and the Heats up and so on and

714
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:17,960
so forth but having cover crops using a

715
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:19,798
mulch layer helps out tremendously for

716
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,600
somebody like me who lives in this this

717
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:23,639
type of climate and I use the straw just

718
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,678
like you do I really like to strive

719
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,919
these cardboard covers just using pieces

720
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:31,159
of cardboard cutting them down and

721
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,320
putting as a cover and that acts as a

722
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:36,080
mulch it's not really breaking down like

723
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:38,319
a mulch does but it covers the soil

724
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:40,960
which can certainly have some benefits

725
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,839
there as well and then for the um cover

726
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,679
crops I'm usually using the Clover it's

727
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:46,480
a nitrogen fixer right so it's actually

728
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,159
grabbing nitrogen from the air

729
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,839
converting it to a form that's usable

730
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,360
for the plants now you need to kill off

731
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:55,079
that cover crop in order to get those

732
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:56,439
advantages but you get those advantages

733
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:58,480
once you kill off the cover crop I want

734
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,679
to warp back to kind of getting to water

735
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,919
a little bit deeper one thing I forgot

736
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:06,798
to ask you about is pH do you monitor

737
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:10,640
the pH of your water going in or monitor

738
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:14,398
the pH in your medium I do not no

739
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,880
I I'm you know I I do think that um the

740
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:17,839
nutrients and everything are going to

741
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,200
decide what the pH of the soil is I

742
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:24,798
don't think me putting water um 65 Water

743
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,399
is going to change my soil to 65 um I do

744
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:29,679
think that maybe to stay in a good

745
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:31,759
balance maybe like a a six to 9 or 10 if

746
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,399
it's that's about where I tried to stay

747
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:36,158
but I don't even check when I got here I

748
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:39,798
did a water test on mine and it was like

749
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:43,440
7.2 so I was more uncomfortable you know

750
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:44,839
hands off just water so I do not pH got

751
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,360
it yeah you hear about a lot of folks

752
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:50,359
that are growing organic living soil no

753
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,319
till whatever style they're doing not

754
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:54,079
phing at all not monitoring the pH just

755
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:55,558
adding in the water and I think it

756
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:57,558
really comes down to having a clean

757
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:58,798
water source to begin you know there's a

758
00:28:57,558 --> 00:28:59,918
lot of controver whether or not you

759
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:01,558
should pH whether or not you should

760
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,720
monitor pH when growing with Organic

761
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:05,759
inputs but I really think it comes down

762
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,558
to what's your water source to begin if

763
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,919
you have a clean water source to begin

764
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:11,558
it's within the proper pH you're good to

765
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:15,919
go now there are some folks that have

766
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:17,519
very high pH 8 nine pH right so they are

767
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,240
adjusting it just to kind of have that

768
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,079
ease of mind now I'm not saying that you

769
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,679
can't get away with just adding that in

770
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,119
because the plant does release acids

771
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:29,080
right to lower the ph to make nutrients

772
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:31,199
available microbes are creating acids

773
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:33,798
that the pH is being adjusted by the

774
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,319
microbes as well so things are happening

775
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:37,879
within the medium that's adjusting the

776
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:40,200
pH it's not just the Water Source going

777
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,640
in that's determining what your pH in

778
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,558
the medium is so yeah I always want like

779
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,200
to ask the pH question for the folks

780
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:47,879
that are growing in living soil to see

781
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,360
like whether or not they dojust the pH

782
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,519
because it's kind of split split between

783
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:53,959
people you know yeah well and I think

784
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:56,359
with me leaning on you know having a

785
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,720
soil test every once in a while I think

786
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:00,158
it's going to help me to kind of figure

787
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,278
out okay okay maybe it ain't the best pH

788
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,080
but it's not affecting anything within

789
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:08,079
the grow now what about EC or some

790
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:10,480
people go by PPM instead in order to get

791
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:13,678
an idea of the nutrition that's in the

792
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,319
medium are you doing any sort of EC PPM

793
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,840
test whether it be a slurry test or a

794
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:19,480
runoff test you want to kind of get an

795
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:22,240
idea of how much nutrition's in the

796
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:25,278
medium nope uh same with ph I'm kind of

797
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,640
hands off when it comes to the ppms um

798
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:29,079
when I did the synthetic for a little

799
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,000
bit I would test runoff and and I just

800
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:32,439
it was mindboggling the invalid results

801
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,200
you'd get you just didn't know what you

802
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,840
were getting um but with Organics we

803
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,159
don't want it to run off so we don't

804
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:41,398
really have any water to test and with

805
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:44,000
the slurry test I'm I'm kind of going

806
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:46,158
towards no tail so being less evasive is

807
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,720
possible makes perfect sense yeah a lot

808
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,640
of organic Growers do the same thing

809
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,880
that way so pretty straightforward let's

810
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,960
get into environment a little bit I want

811
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,039
to uh dive deeper into temperature

812
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,278
humidity VPD CO2 all that good stuff

813
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:01,398
let's start with temperature what do you

814
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:04,440
typically aim for for temperature for

815
00:31:01,398 --> 00:31:07,158
the different stages of growth um for

816
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:10,120
the seedling stage I like to stay in the

817
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:11,320
76 to 80 um I'm in a basement so it's

818
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,558
kind of hard to get the warmer

819
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:14,798
temperatures without sucking your

820
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:17,319
humidity out so I find a good balance

821
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:20,240
about 75 to 80 and I pretty much ride

822
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:22,960
that same temperature throughout the

823
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,880
whole grow uh towards flow the end of

824
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:29,519
flow I'll kind of try to stay towards

825
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:31,639
that 75 sometimes 74 73 is what I get um

826
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:35,480
and that's fine with me um I haven't

827
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:37,278
noticed any you know less growth or

828
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,079
obviously the the Tarpin have a lot to

829
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:40,919
do with temperature that we're starting

830
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:42,359
to realize and I feel like the lower

831
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,559
temperature is helping me out as far as

832
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:47,879
keeping some tpin other than flour

833
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:50,839
that's pretty much it 75 to 80 all the

834
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,360
way till finish the grow now what about

835
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:54,158
relative humidity what do you typically

836
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:56,000
aim for for the different stages of

837
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,639
growth um same thing with the

838
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,398
temperature I kind of ride 70 um I'll go

839
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:02,879
a little higher when there seedlings if

840
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,959
if I see 7580 you know obviously that's

841
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,919
good I'm not going to try to fight that

842
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:12,038
but when it comes to vegging I'm about

843
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:15,559
65 70% and I ride that until week three

844
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:18,079
of flour and then I'll do a 5% decrease

845
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:20,918
as the weeks go on but I I usually

846
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:23,079
typically stay about 50% um with me

847
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:25,679
being in the basement it's just kind of

848
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:28,278
you know you kind of tackle your your

849
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,240
weakest link and for me it was kind of

850
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:33,038
just okay don't mess with this too much

851
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,720
let's just ride this um 50% maybe have

852
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:37,278
some extra fans going in the room and I

853
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,639
haven't had any bad luck with petritis

854
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:41,398
or mold yet

855
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:43,319
so I'd like to stick at the 50% if I

856
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:46,119
could I just I felt like it was there

857
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:49,519
wasn't as much drooping for me so is 50%

858
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:51,439
like the lowest you go in flower yes yes

859
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,960
and and I know a lot of people are

860
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,240
against that and I'm asking for problems

861
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,679
and I probably am um but like I said

862
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,120
being in the B basement it's hard for me

863
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:04,798
to get that 45% without sacrificing

864
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:07,558
something else so with the airflow and

865
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:09,519
um I got intake out takes I got two fans

866
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:12,798
going one in the middle of the canopy

867
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,960
one on top of the canopy uh so so far so

868
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:17,079
good I don't have the VPD chart

869
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,798
memorized in regards to like the dark

870
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:20,119
green range versus the light green range

871
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:22,278
versus the yellow range but the the

872
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:24,119
numbers you mentioned there seems like

873
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:26,398
they would be either in the dark green

874
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:28,518
range or light green range for VPD are

875
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:29,918
you monitoring VPD at all definitely and

876
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:31,798
that's what I kind of Base my

877
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:35,919
temperatures and humidity on is just to

878
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:37,638
keep that VPD um when I'm in seedling 7

879
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,759
point8 I'm okay with maybe a little

880
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:41,798
lower um that's what I'm shooting for

881
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:44,839
and then I'll ride that all the way to

882
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:48,480
the end of veg and get to you know

883
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:50,199
beginning of flower maybe 1.2 VPD but I

884
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,038
do try to stay in those parameters on

885
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,798
that I think it's the pulse chart that

886
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:55,038
you

887
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,519
use that's pretty much what I've used

888
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:58,319
most of the time is kind of stay in the

889
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:01,558
parameters every once while I think I

890
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:05,798
creep up to 1.6 1.7 which is a little

891
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:07,398
too dry for my liking um but it's okay

892
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:08,800
it's I think it's in the yellow range or

893
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:11,239
something around there oh yeah I'm

894
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:15,519
looking at the pulse monitor VPD chart

895
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:18,000
right now and uh it says for see 79 Dees

896
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:20,239
the dark green range is between 50 and

897
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,358
56 so you're right in the ballpark as

898
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:25,479
far as that and I think a lot of people

899
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,319
when it comes to lights off that some

900
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,800
people like oh just ignore VP doesn't

901
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,760
really matter matter during lights off

902
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,119
other people say it does matter you

903
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,639
absolutely want to still monitor that

904
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,039
right you can have humidity spikes

905
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,639
during lights off happens to me all the

906
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:40,079
time all the time so being able to lower

907
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,320
that R because your temperature is

908
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,960
dropping right with lights off so if

909
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:46,720
you're at a 70° according to this chart

910
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:50,639
70° F well this is calling the dark

911
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:54,398
green range from 34 to 44% RH so it's

912
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,440
looking for a lot lower of an RH when

913
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:58,279
you have that temperature drop so VPD

914
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,358
chart is definitely something that's

915
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,720
pretty interesting I know some people

916
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:03,319
just ignore it they can say hey the

917
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:04,679
plants are going to go fine we outside

918
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,680
of the VPD range which is absolutely

919
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:07,919
right you'll definitely be able to get

920
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:10,199
to a harvest uh but if you're looking to

921
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,440
optimize growth keep plants healthy

922
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:15,559
trying to stay Within These ranges on

923
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:18,159
the VPD chart is wise well and and

924
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:19,719
that's what's you know your spikes I get

925
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,399
the same thing in my tents and I think

926
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:23,639
that's where the AC Infinity controls

927
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,838
just changed everything because you can

928
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:28,239
have your fan you know up to 10 if you

929
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:30,039
need to when they're off and you know

930
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:31,319
maybe suck some of that humidity out and

931
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:33,759
you know have that all on a timer to

932
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,079
where it just all hands off it's it does

933
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,480
make it easier to control spikes so much

934
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,240
easier how about CO2 are you

935
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,920
supplementing CO2 at all I did an exhale

936
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:46,838
bag one time and I just didn't

937
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,200
really see any huge benefits where I was

938
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:51,159
going to you know explain to myself I'm

939
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:52,679
going to buy this every grow and like

940
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:55,239
I've seen in your videos you know I got

941
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:57,318
five cats three kids and a wife and I'm

942
00:35:55,239 --> 00:36:00,078
always down here running around so I

943
00:35:57,318 --> 00:36:03,318
always find one cat in the garden so

944
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,760
someone's breathing and I have a a CO2

945
00:36:03,318 --> 00:36:08,800
meter that I have hanging in there and

946
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,160
it's about 350 400 and then when I get

947
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,160
down here you know there's a lot of

948
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:16,199
people home you know it'll get up to 6

949
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:17,799
700 800 which is mindblowing so that's

950
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:22,118
kind of how I'm supplementing is just

951
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,440
our own you know exhales and CO2 pretty

952
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:25,960
straightforward yeah I've tried the

953
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,960
exhale bags before and I have a CO2

954
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,639
monitor as well so I'm able to kind of

955
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,159
and it wasn't very consistent you know

956
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,679
it was it was up and down sometimes they

957
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:36,639
go in there it' be 78 900 sometimes

958
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:38,879
actually reaching a th000 I was like oh

959
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:40,239
this is fantastic but then uh other

960
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,640
times I'd go in there and it would just

961
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:45,399
be 5600 so it's like it's very

962
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:47,480
inconsistent so I stopped using the XL

963
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,160
bags as well and same thing with the um

964
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,400
tnb Naturals canisters same exact thing

965
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:54,159
kind of just the inconsistency and the

966
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,559
fact that you've got to you're supposed

967
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:59,519
to buy a new refill packet every two

968
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:01,639
weeks which can become costly over time

969
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,960
you know what I mean so I stop using

970
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:06,879
those ones as well let's uh let's get

971
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:09,039
into IPM next so integrated Pest

972
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,599
Management things to do in order to

973
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,880
prevent pest from invading your growth

974
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:16,160
space what is your IPM routine um so I

975
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,760
try to focus on recycling three

976
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:20,318
different

977
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,480
um ways of going about it I use the

978
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:25,480
essential

979
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,559
oils um which I've kind of had a bad

980
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,358
effect on them but it may have been my

981
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:29,480
own doing I spoiler sprayed when I

982
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:31,559
should have waited a little bit for the

983
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,000
lights to go off and I got some burning

984
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:35,679
but that was my own doing I Ed the

985
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,838
essential oils the em5 from build the

986
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:41,239
soil um and I just got a new one from

987
00:37:38,838 --> 00:37:43,599
petrow the crop Defender which I think

988
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:46,598
it's got peppermint oil and an organic

989
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,039
emulsifier I'm not sure of all the um

990
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:49,680
specifics but there's only three or four

991
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:51,838
or five ingredients in there and they're

992
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:55,679
all organic and I just implemented that

993
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:59,239
into my garden um I got my first pest

994
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:01,838
ever was I believe it was Clover Mite um

995
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:03,318
little round orange red looking bug and

996
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:06,279
they started actually making their way

997
00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:07,880
up my stocks so I paniced cuz I was on

998
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,280
the road and I came home and I saw this

999
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:15,358
so then I hit it with the em5 and the

1000
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:16,680
crop Defender and two weeks went by and

1001
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:17,799
they went away and then all of a sudden

1002
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:20,639
they came back and I hit them with

1003
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,280
another dose and that just goes to show

1004
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:23,879
I got to stay up on IPM because if you

1005
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,760
wait for something to happen it's too

1006
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,640
late luckily they didn't make it to the

1007
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,760
canopy and they were eradicated I used

1008
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:32,679
some ground mustard seed which I think

1009
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,520
helps um as far as the soil keeping them

1010
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:37,000
underneath there but yeah I try to

1011
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:38,800
implement the three rotation to three

1012
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,119
and I may switch it up I've used NE

1013
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,640
before when I first got the beds and

1014
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,760
trying to find out the watering I was

1015
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:49,000
overwatering a little bit so I had a lot

1016
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,079
of gats so I had the traps and you know

1017
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,199
finally they did eradicate and you know

1018
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,960
the beds were able to balance thems out

1019
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:56,598
I was going to ask you what pests you've

1020
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,679
kind of come across and how you got

1021
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:01,800
resolved them and you just answered that

1022
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:04,838
right there for the gats was it just

1023
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,880
just the neem and The Traps or or what

1024
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:09,599
uh I used the neem and the essential

1025
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,559
oils and the em5 actually all in one

1026
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,119
okay um I just went for it all I you

1027
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:14,759
know cuz it was bad you'd open up the

1028
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,280
tent and they were flying in front of

1029
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,440
your face it wasn't just one or two here

1030
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,680
or there and I panicked cuz I go I just

1031
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:24,639
got this balanced soil what am I doing

1032
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:26,919
wrong here um which you know Jeremy says

1033
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:29,078
that you know starting a new bed you're

1034
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,119
going to have it's just there's compost

1035
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:34,880
there's you know more moisture than you

1036
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,400
know your regular size bed and um but it

1037
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,880
once I sprayed those on there they went

1038
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,440
away and it kind of balanced themselves

1039
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,680
out and I assume that you were in the

1040
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,119
vegetation stage when you were battling

1041
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,719
that or were you spraying that stuff

1042
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,960
while in flower No No Yeah I was in veg

1043
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:49,358
luckily I'm a long veger too kind of

1044
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:53,199
just waiting to see for something to

1045
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:55,799
happen and um it did and I eradicated it

1046
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:57,879
luckily and I did notice one or two

1047
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,119
after the fact looking through my Loop

1048
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,800
for uh on the tricomes there was a natat

1049
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:04,760
or two in there which you know it's not

1050
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,880
the end of the world especially being

1051
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,640
the the home growing you know in a big

1052
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,960
facility maybe but for me it wasn't

1053
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:12,559
really too big I like bugs and dirt and

1054
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,159
stuff how often are you actually getting

1055
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:16,838
in there and kind of inspecting your

1056
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,759
plants and and looking for pests well

1057
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:21,400
unfortunately I only can get in there on

1058
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,359
the weekends um the occasion I will be

1059
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,599
home during the week and I do try to

1060
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:27,880
dedicate a lot of time here I'll wake up

1061
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,280
super early in the morning kind of get

1062
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:33,680
in get it out of the way um I could do a

1063
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:36,200
better job um watching for issues so

1064
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:37,318
like last time it kind of they got up

1065
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:40,439
the stock when maybe I could have

1066
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:43,000
eradicated it before then um so I do

1067
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,519
need to do a better job of overseeing my

1068
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,519
canapes and you know finally looking

1069
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:48,159
through there and making sure

1070
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:49,759
everything's okay yeah cuz like you

1071
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:52,159
mentioned it can get out of control

1072
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,560
quick I mean I you meant you when you

1073
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:56,078
talking about the fungus gats and how

1074
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:57,759
out of control it got I thought about a

1075
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,560
time where it got out of control for and

1076
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,319
it was just so bad if you're not on top

1077
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:05,880
of it it gets out of control and then

1078
00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:08,559
you get frustrated and then you start

1079
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,318
getting uh worried that the plant's not

1080
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:12,799
going to get to harvest so yeah being on

1081
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:15,000
top of it scouting I typically go go in

1082
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,640
there every couple days and I am

1083
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,599
scouting looking for pests I always have

1084
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:21,279
the yellow stickies there to make sure

1085
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,440
just really as an identifier right it's

1086
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,519
not going to illuminate the population

1087
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,440
just having yellow stickies in there but

1088
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:29,759
at least you're able to see if they're

1089
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,599
there and then take action from there so

1090
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,280
is there anything else that you feel

1091
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,800
like we need to know or the audience

1092
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,480
needs to know about keeping plants

1093
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,800
healthy when growing with Organic inputs

1094
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,358
um just trust your gut and stay balanced

1095
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,880
less is more with everything when it

1096
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:47,159
comes to Organics you you don't want to

1097
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,519
overdo it um the soil is going to take

1098
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:51,000
care of itself U especially if like I

1099
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:53,480
said if you started balanced and you're

1100
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,719
staying on top of watering moistures and

1101
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,358
making sure everything's in in the right

1102
00:41:55,719 --> 00:42:00,759
place I think um you're Crush in

1103
00:41:58,358 --> 00:42:03,239
Organics I like I said I travel all the

1104
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,920
time for work I'm hardly home and if you

1105
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:07,719

1106
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,079
plants and it's just it really is if you

1107
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:11,118
got the right equipment and the right

1108
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:12,680
mentors like Mr Gro himself you can

1109
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,358
Crush too I think that's some really

1110
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:16,000
good advice yeah like I mentioned in the

1111
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:17,318
beginning of the episode I'm looking at

1112
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,318
your Instagram and you're just you're

1113
00:42:17,318 --> 00:42:20,759
crushing it man so great job definitely

1114
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:23,159
keep up the good work I knew I knew you

1115
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,359
grew a lot of the chillo G how many have

1116
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:27,920
those have you grown out so far uh this

1117
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:30,000
will be eight or nine

1118
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,318
um and I kind of did a little pheno

1119
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,440
picking right off the rip um just how

1120
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,000
they were growing structure-wise and

1121
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,800
rting off the males which was the

1122
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,318

we can get into you know lighting and

1209
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,599
the conversation could go on and on and

1210
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:49,078

talk about and expand upon when it comes

1216
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,679
to using organic inputs and keeping

1217
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:03,558
plants healthy throughout the entire

1218
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:06,199
