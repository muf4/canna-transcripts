name is uh Sly AKA Loco as everybody

83
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,040
should know um I have been growing about

84
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:03,238
6 years now I started with a friend

85
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:06,079
friend actually came by and he gave me a

86
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,719
plant and I decided that I wanted to

87
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,159
grow that plant out and so I went

88
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,919
outside and I grew it out it was pretty

89
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:15,840
fun and yeah I the way I got started was

90
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,518
kind of a little crazy too cuz for those

91
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,319
who don't know I had gotten sick I was a

92
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,080
big drug user and alcoholic long time

96
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,840
weird because nobody around me caught it

97
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:39,200

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,519
what size grow space are you in and kind

137
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,680
of how many plants are you growing um

138
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,279
right now I just took a little size or I

139
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,879
checked the size of my room and it's

140
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:19,679
about 10 by 20 um and I have two tents

141
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:23,399
in there I have two 4x4 tents also a

142
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:27,360
little one uh 2x two tent too that is

143
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:30,038
for my clones um and yeah that's what I

144
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,639
have in there pretty nice side I think

145
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:34,399
it's pretty good also I have a sink in

146
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,720
there which not a lot of people have not

147
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,719
a lot of people have sinks in their

148
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,720
rooms and so I think I feel like it

149
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,120
makes it a lot easier to flush to water

150
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,280
you know go about the daily stuff that

151
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,199
you need to do with your plants W that

152
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,638
makes make it so much easier dude when

153
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,840
I'm between grows like if I have to like

154
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,960
wash out grow pots for example like

155
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,359
doing in a bathtub you know bending over

156
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,159
and like man I my back hurts after a

157
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,600
while after sitting there scrubbing and

158
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,720
I've been doing things outside and still

159
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,000
you're kind of bending over and stuff

160
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,520
having a sink would be really nice I

161
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,720
wish I had wish I had a sink yeah that's

162
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,959
what a lot of people tell me they always

163
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,479
tell me that I'm very lucky to have a

164
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:13,038
sink there and that um I think it is too

165
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:15,598
because when I have to take my plants

166
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,279
into the tub um cuz back in the day I

167
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:20,120
would flush in the tub for some reason I

168
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,038
don't know why oh because my plants were

169
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,360
too big so they were too big to go in

170
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:25,959
the sink so I had to take them out to

171
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,479
the tub and that was a hassle and so I

172
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:30,719
definitely felt for people who have to

173
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:33,000
move their plants out into a a uh tub or

174
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,000
something like that into a area where

175
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,319
they can get

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
wet um and you that would be a lot

177
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:42,199
harder I really would not like that and

178
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,598
I feel also that if you have trellises

179
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,720
in your tent um you wouldn't be able to

180
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:50,360
take the plant out and you know do

181
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,720
whatever you have to do so that would

182
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,560
have been another problem yeah for me I

183
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,840
typically grow smaller plants a little

184
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,918
bit easier to transport from the tent to

185
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:02,079
a tub for example back when I flushed I

186
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:05,198
kind of switched over to Organics so I'm

187
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,800
not really doing flushes as much anymore

188
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,120
uh if ever usually it was just with

189
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,598
synthetic nutrients but uh yeah I mostly

190
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,439
just grow small plants sometimes medium

191
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,319
plants you on the other hand grow large

192
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,439
plants and that's what we're going to

193
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,560
talk about today really is growing large

194
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:21,279
plants indoors I think it's a topic that

195
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,319
we haven't really covered in depth

196
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,758
before and I'm glad when we first talked

197
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,319
about well hey what should we talk about

198
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,800
this time around you had said hey I grow

199
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,080
large plants indoors perfect perfect

200
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,680
topic let's base it around that let's

201
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:37,120
get deep into your style of growing

202
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,160
larger plants indoors so the first

203
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,439
question I got for you is are you going

204
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,639
after like certain genetics that are

205
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,399
like deemed high yielders for example or

206
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,680
have like a certain morphology like

207
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,158
anything in the listing description

208
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,280
that's going to say hey this is going to

209
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:54,680
be good for growing the large plants

210
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:57,119
indoors no actually I don't I um just go

211
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,319
with whatever genetics I can get

212
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,280
whatever genetics come around I'm very C

213
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:06,960
curious curious person so I want to see

214
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:09,439
if I can take a plant that is supposed

215
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:12,439
to be small and see if I can make it a

216
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:14,800
bigger plant which in turn would mean

217
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:16,560
that I have to do a longer veg time

218
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,918
right and that's one thing that I

219
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:23,720
usually do is I will start off in like a

220
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:26,560
one gallon right pot and then transfer I

221
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,280
feel like transferring is one of the

222
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,918
reasons why my plants get too so big is

223
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,120
because I transfer a lot I'll transfer

224
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:36,759
from a 1 gallon to a 3 gallon from a 3

225
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,278
gallon to its final thing is a 5 gallon

226
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:41,559
usually if I did go a little bit above a

227
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:44,679
5 gallon if I went to a s gallon the

228
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:46,439
plant would be massive just massive any

229
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:49,519
every time that I've done a 7 gon plant

230
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,640
it's just been incredibly big all the

231
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,959
way up to the top I can't move you know

232
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:55,759
the light up any higher um I just have

233
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:58,159
to start training and start bringing the

234
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,759
branches down in turn I'm probably going

235
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,559
a little bit too fast there for that but

236
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:06,078
um yeah they're just big plants man very

237
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:09,119
big plants I think it's the the longer

238
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:11,239
veg is what I do CU I usually veg for

239
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,560
about at least minimum seven weeks

240
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,839
minimum got it now for the genetics can

241
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,958
you name off maybe a couple different

242
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,120
plants that you've grown it could be

243
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,838
recently it could be at any point where

244
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,600
you feel like hey these ones were easy

245
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:27,120
to kind of you know they grew pretty

246
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,600
fast they grew large quickly without the

247
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,679
longer veg time maybe or is there

248
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,360
anything that kind of comes to mind that

249
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,919
you're like oh this is good for a large

250
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,440
Plant yeah the there's one that a lot of

251
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:41,799
people know is gg4 um that one is

252
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:46,600
usually a big plant very big one um I

253
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:49,159
also had a blue fire that was a massive

254
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,879
plant I didn't have to do a long I

255
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:53,838
didn't have to do a long veg or anything

256
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:57,519
with that one it just grew big it was a

257
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,959
big one um also this last one that I was

258
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,879
doing was the Triple Crown Triple Crown

259
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:04,039
was a big one too I didn't actually have

260
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:07,360
to do too much to it had a long stretch

261
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:10,360
on it too when I switched to flower it

262
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,639
was very big so I don't really go

263
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,720
looking for any other the big genetics I

264
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,039
just come across what I come across and

265
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,040
I'll just grow it out that makes sense

266
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,120
now what are you using for lighting it's

267
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,799
arguably one of the most contributing

268
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,879
factors to growth right is the the light

269
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,919
energy so you're indoors what are you

270
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:30,559
useing for grow lights so for the grow

271
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:32,639
lights I have a high Photon flood hpf

272
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,039
4000 that's what I'm going right now I

273
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,399
am sponsored by them also by the way uh

274
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,519
very good company I suggest people to go

275
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:44,120
check them out uh it's a bar style

276
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:47,839
LED um has the Red Spectrum it's a full

277
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,320
spectrum like and I also have the spider

278
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,399
farmer

279
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:55,760
se5000 is in my other 4x4 and I only

280
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,039
keep those at about 60% okay now you

281
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,600
chasing after a certain par for those

282
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:01,120
that don't know I have have quite a few

283
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,200
beginners that kind of tuned into this

284
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,519
par photosynthetic active radiation

285
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,240
there's a couple different measurements

286
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,399
ppf which is kind of the total light

287
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,560
output of a fixture ppfd which is kind

288
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,159
of a spot check in basic terms are you

289
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:16,239
aiming for a certain

290
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:19,600
ppfd um I'm not actually I don't have a

291
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:24,480
part tester or ppf uh I think it might

292
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,920
be on the AC controller no no actually I

293
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,000
don't though I just roll with it and I

294
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,958
read the plants the plants will kind of

295
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,200
tell me if the light is too intense you

296
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:33,278
know how they start to get the past to

297
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,600
HS or something like that um that's when

298
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:38,838
I know to turn down the light so I

299
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,480
basically read the the read the plants

300
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,360
and then what about CO2 it's another

301
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,519
thing that really can contribute to a

302
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:48,200
lot faster plant growth right do you run

303
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:50,320
CO2 at all um I don't well I do now I

304
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,240
haven't in the past in the past I just

305
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,120
let uh just let the plants grow with the

306
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,200
lights the water but I started adding

307
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,480
CO2 recently um I have this product

308
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,000
that's called

309
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,759
it's the VIP Plantation CO2 maker um

310
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,879
he's a guy on Instagram he makes a

311
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,439
little uh concoction which I think it's

312
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:11,559
just yeast and sugar or something like

313
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,240
that and water put six cups of water

314
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:16,039
shake it up and just hang it up in your

315
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,600
tent and it gives you your plants of CO2

316
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:19,039
how long does it last and do you need to

317
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,480
like refresh it every couple weeks or

318
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,838
something or what yeah it only lasts two

319
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,120
weeks and then he gives you a package

320
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,519
you get one container that's already

321
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,198
made so you just or that's ready to go

322
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:31,759
you just the water mix it up and then

323
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:34,278
it'll work but then it also comes with

324
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:36,559
another package for the next two weeks

325
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:38,078
so one of those packages lasts two weeks

326
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,479
and then you got to refresh it take it

327
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:43,879
out wash it add the other packet add

328
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,399
some more water and then boom and I have

329
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:50,480
about two six I have about eight weeks

330
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,159
of packaging there to use but I think

331
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,920
that would be perfect for a veg so

332
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,120
what's the total cost on that do you

333
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,479
happen to know how much the packages

334
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,720
cost and kind of how much you're

335
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,360
spending per run yeah the whole set up

336
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,759
that it was about $30 to have them ship

337
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,519
it out and everything so it was about

338
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:09,078
the same price that I see at the grow

339
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,480
stores so but his is a little bit bigger

340
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:12,719
and it lasts a little bit longer you get

341
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,480
an extra couple weeks on there for that

342
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,199
$30 so I felt that that was play that

343
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,560
was the way that I wanted to go and I've

344
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:21,319
developed a a reputation or a rapport

345
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:23,078
with him so you know he hooked it up a

346
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,560
little bit more too so nice now you have

347
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:26,559
a CO2 monitor where you're kind of

348
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,919
monitoring things and dialing in with

349
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,919
that type of setup with CO2 you don't

350
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:33,159
have as much control as you would with

351
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:35,319
like a tank for example do you have a

352
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:37,399
monitor are you able to see like what it

353
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,199
goes up to and and what the low point is

354
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:43,078
and stuff I don't have a monitor yet I'm

355
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:44,399
actually very new to the CO2 so I don't

356
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:48,000
have a monitor I wouldn't even know what

357
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,198
I'm looking for I uh I'm very new very

358
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,639
green to this one I got to start doing a

359
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:53,679
little bit more research so I can figure

360
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:56,399
out how you know cuz I think it's in

361
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:59,758
ppms right yep PPM some people go up to

362
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,000
like you know 14,500 PPM at the max I

363
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,720
naturally for me well naturally outside

364
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,240
it's what like 400 450 PPM naturally

365
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,600
outdoors if you're indoors us exhaling

366
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,720
and I have a three-month old daughter

367
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,079
she's exhaling CO2 I have two cats

368
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,079
they're exhaling CO2 every time I go on

369
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,120
my tent it's at like 700 so it's always

370
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:20,559
elevated a little bit now for me I have

371
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,440
an exhaust and I'm pulling air out and

372
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,239
the fresh air that's coming in is from

373
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,480
my house so for me I just I don't even

374
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,278
run CO2 anymore I used to run the um

375
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,079
mushroom bags for a little while I did

376
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,480
see some increase in it but there's some

377
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:36,559
kind of inconsistencies I ran the tnb

378
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,399
naturals before again same thing where

379
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,679
it's just kind of up and down up and

380
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,120
down no real stable result and then just

381
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,719
finding out you know for me I'm just a

382
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,600
small home grower I grow these small

383
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,839
plants just myself six to 12 plants Max

384
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,159
is usually what I'm running in that

385
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,720
range I personally don't really need to

386
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:55,159
run CO2 but I can see for the folks you

387
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,399
know somebody like yourself who's

388
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:59,439
looking to grow large plants CO2 can

389
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,240
certainly be beneficial so yeah I was

390
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,639
just curious on that one yeah and that's

391
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,120
one thing that I've been trying to keep

392
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,039
an eye on is trying to see if it really

393
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,560
does work if it's giving my plants the

394
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,879
more faster grow the bigger grow um all

395
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:16,559
that and I feel that it is I feel that

396
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:19,078
they are growing uh faster bigger which

397
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,518
is always good you know I really like a

398
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:24,159
a nice big plant to go on the veg what

399
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,799
the way I feel is that FEG is the

400
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,719
pregame to the game you know the game is

401
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,078
when you go into flower and that's

402
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,120
that's the Super Bowl so you want to be

403
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:35,439
very ready before you put that plant

404
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,639
into the flower stage absolutely yeah I

405
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,440
mean kind of rule of thumb is the plant

406
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,039
to be the half the size you want

407
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,399
generally because you're going to expect

408
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,078
some stretch to happen even after

409
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,519
flipping the light cycle and for the

410
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,599
plant to be healthy right so like a lot

411
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:49,879
of people won't flip the flow unless

412
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,519
their plant is fully healthy if they

413
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:54,318
seen any sorts of deficiencies or

414
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,318
anything they won't flip now of course

415
00:15:54,318 --> 00:16:00,240
with autof flowers you're kind of so

416
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:02,039
there because yeah it's on a timeline

417
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,120
right so if you come across deficiency

418
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:05,318
well you just got to roll with the

419
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,839
punches in a sense and just take it but

420
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:08,120
with photo periods you you kind of have

421
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
that control right you could keep it in

422
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,839
veg for a little bit longer get it

423
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,199
healthy again and then be able to flip

424
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,040
the flour from there so that's one the

425
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:19,399
reason that I don't really mess with

426
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:22,120
autof flowers is because I like the the

427
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,679
the control to being able to change it

428
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,198
into flower when I'm ready when I feel

429
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:28,559
that the plant is ready which is kind of

430
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:32,120
you know kind of a little messed up to

431
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,719
say it like that but it's when I feel

432
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,679
that the plant is going to be able to

433
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,440
give me the best buds is when I want to

434
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,838
send it into flower you know I don't

435
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,600
want you turning on you know small and

436
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,560
then giving me little buds I need big

437
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,120
buds and so um yeah that's what that's

438
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:49,719
probably why I don't mess with auto

439
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,278
flowers I hear you I've grown about

440
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,800
probably two dozen close to three dozen

441
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:56,519
autof flowers now and I got some good

442
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:59,240
results I do like them once in a while

443
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,120
but for the most part I do prefer having

444
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,879
that control over the photo period you

445
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,798
know being able to keep it in veg for as

446
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,000
long as I want so I can shape the plant

447
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,400
the way I want it then be able to flip

448
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,558
over the flower when I'm ready so that's

449
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,519
just personal preference there now what

450
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,798
about like temperature and humidity what

451
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:17,918
are you usually aiming for for that so

452
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:19,439
for TS I have been um messing with TS a

453
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,880
little bit because I've been sitting

454
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:25,000
here I'm a very experimental person so I

455
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:30,120
like to go around and check and see okay

456
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,798
how do they work at a 72 73° 75 and now

457
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:36,599
right now I'm at 78° with about 50 to

458
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:38,960
60% humidity which some people would say

459
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:40,279
it's kind of low cuz in my room in my

460
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,798
little room you would think that it'd be

461
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:44,279
easier to control the temperatures but

462
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:47,119
it's not okay summertime it gets really

463
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:50,678
hot winter time it gets really cold so I

464
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:52,839
have to either turn up the heater more

465
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,160
or the air conditioner which I put a air

466
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:55,759
a portable air conditioner in there

467
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,960
during the summertime because over here

468
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,119
on the West side or on the east side of

469
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,679
Washington

470
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:04,359
is not like the West Side okay the West

471
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,320
Side you got uh more calmer temperature

472
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:09,158
70 80° is the hottest maybe 90° is the

473
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:11,319
hottest it'll get over there it gets 10

474
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:14,960
and something over here on the regular

475
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:16,720
every summer so over here and there's

476
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,440
zero humidity I think you deal with this

477
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,480
too cuz being where you're at um you

478
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:26,720
have to add humidity in and so we'll get

479
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,919
a humidifier but then on the same time

480
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,400
since I'm in a small little room if I

481
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,799
have so many plants going it puts the

482
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,000
humidity through the roof so then I'd

483
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:36,240
have to turn on the

484
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,480
dehumidifier right and then turning on

485
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,798
the dehumidifier then I have to is going

486
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,880
to add a little bit of heat so then I

487
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:43,279
got to turn up the air conditioner so

488
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,120
I'm constantly fighting with

489
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,240
temperatures in my little grow room

490
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,959
balancing that environment easier said

491
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,400
than done I mean that's a something when

492
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,360
I first started growing 14 years ago

493
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,559
indoors and I was like yeah it should be

494
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,359
easy to control you know I get my HPS

495
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:59,079
put the HPS in there put my plants in

496
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,119
there right away and all of a sudden the

497
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:02,759
skyrocketed with temp with heat I was

498
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,158
like what the heck so then I have to get

499
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:05,798
an exhaust have the exhaust and the

500
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:06,919
exhaust running all times and all of a

501
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:07,918
sudden the heat is still high it's like

502
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:10,360
what the heck then you have to add

503
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,880
Cooling and it's it's a balancing act

504
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:14,519
for sure is your heater and humidifier

505
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,440
and all that stuff that's in your lung

506
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:18,000
room I assume which is the room that

507
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,279
your grow tents are in and you

508
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,480
controlling that air and so that way any

509
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:25,519
air coming into the tents are of the

510
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,640
proper R and temperature yes that's what

511
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:30,558
that's the way I try to keep it to where

512
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,720
the outside temps are better or you know

513
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:36,200
a little bit more dialed in the inside

514
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:39,038
temps but I do have the the AC Infinity

515
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:42,038
controller on the tent on one of my AC

516
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,960
Infinity tents and that controller does

517
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:45,798
tell me you know the TS the humidity and

518
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,079
everything in one of them but the other

519
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:51,038
tent I don't have that so I'm just

520
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,720
freestyling and I kind of assume that

521
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:54,079
it's in the right same thing as the

522
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,400
other tank cuz I mean it's the same

523
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,319
environment but you know you really want

524
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,759
to be on top of that and I just just

525
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:05,158
been slacking on that veg tent a little

526
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:07,480
bit so you mentioned 78° F and 50 to 60%

527
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:10,880
R is that for the vegetation stage or

528
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:13,279
the flowering stage or both uh for about

529
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,799
both okay got it so you're running that

530
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:19,480
the whole way through yeah cuz I would

531
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:22,279
like I would like my uh my my humidity

532
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:26,000
to go a little bit no actually cuz I

533
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:29,319
like that point in flour because I'm

534
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,720
very uh paranoid about getting

535
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:34,119
mold and getting you know just mold I'm

536
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,440
very paranoid about that that's why I

537
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:37,798
try to keep the humidity very low in the

538
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,798
room because I don't want to build up

539
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:42,038
mold behind the walls which is

540
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:43,480
possibility in growing which some people

541
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:47,200
need to know out there is if you are

542
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,839
growing into a if you're growing in an a

543
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,400
complex or apartment complex or

544
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:51,839
something that's what they are worried

545
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,640
about they're worried about you getting

546
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,079
the humidity so high and mold growing

547
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,679
behind the wall and nobody wants that so

548
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:01,279
make sure that your humidity is low in

549
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,400
your room but in your tent in your tent

550
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,158
you want high humidity so it's a little

551
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,519
balance there that you got to figure out

552
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:09,480
I've heard of like gr operations people

553
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,519
have converted their entire house and

554
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,720
the way they got busted is they see the

555
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,119
condensation on the windows so like

556
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,440
neighbors and stuff we see the

557
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,399
condensation build up and that's too

558
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,038
high of humidity right in there and so

559
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,440
yeah good that stuff could definitely

560
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:26,079
cause mold to happen now me I often get

561
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,600
people commenting on my videos when they

562
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:32,599
see my setup because I have it in I have

563
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:35,278
a 9x12 bedroom and have a couple tents

564
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:36,918
in there right now have a 4x4 and a 2x4

565
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:39,000
I've had other size tents in there in

566
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:42,600
the past but my exhaust is coming from

567
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,679
the tent up into my attic now I have

568
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:46,639
okay ventilation into the attic as well

569
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,759
right so it goes completely out but I've

570
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,520
had so many people like hey you

571
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,480
shouldn't do that cuz that'll mold up

572
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,278
your your attic valid point very very

573
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,278
valid point if you're just dumping high

574
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:57,319
humidity in there depending on you know

575
00:21:56,278 --> 00:21:59,640
what the temperature is and stuff like

576
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:01,599
that it could actually cause mold to

577
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,278
happen on your roof there on the inside

578
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,119
panels I've seen pictures of that and it

579
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:06,880
looks like just a complete nightmare I

580
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,519
live in a very dry climate I have to say

581
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,720
that in every single episode every

582
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,079
single one of my main Channel videos

583
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,079
every single one of my podcast episodes

584
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,558
I live in a dry climate so even if I

585
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:19,480
dump stuff up up there it's usually not

586
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:21,798
high enough to cause mold but those

587
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,839
living in a high humidity area they're

588
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:26,278
dumping stuff into their attic they high

589
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,480
likelihood of mold happening there and

590
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:30,240
for my understanding that can be very

591
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,400
very cost so I mention that one yeah and

592
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,200
it only takes one Spore guys one Spore

593
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,519
of mold and it will just blow up and

594
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,679
it'll just reproduce and reproduce and

595
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:42,079
sometimes in the worst case scenario you

596
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,559
don't know that it's happening and you

597
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:45,359
don't know that it's happening until you

598
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:47,879
start getting sick

599
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,678
so everybody please be on top of that

600
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,360
make sure that you're not getting mold

601
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,919
in places that you can't see absolutely

602
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:57,278
so we talked about your grow room we

603
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,159
talked about lighting we talked about

604
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:01,759
environment condition conditions let's

605
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:03,720
see what else impacts the size of the

606
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:05,919
plant we we didn't talk about soil are

607
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,919
you in soil cocoa Hydro if you're in

608
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:13,120
soil what's in your mix I am using a uh

609
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:16,840
Happy Frog soil so I just recently

610
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:19,038
switched to organic um amendments so

611
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:20,558
that I can build my soil so now I'm

612
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:23,119
using the same soil instead because I

613
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:25,119
used to just go uh Ed soil throw it in

614
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,959
out in like my yard and I'd have this

615
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:29,879
big pile of used soil that I wasn't just

616
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,640
reusing again you know and I just go get

617
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:35,320
another bag well I recently since

618
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,240
watching you guys uh decided that I can

619
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:39,158
re or I learned that I could reuse the

620
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,558
soil so I'm like oh okay well I've been

621
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:42,520
wasting a lot of money so now I'm going

622
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,240
to go over there get all that soil and

623
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:49,519
so I went and ran got

624
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:53,240
a a 26 gallon bin that I put my soil in

625
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:56,599
and now I am mixing them with a GU green

626
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,640
dry amendments so I buil that with some

627
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:01,399
worm casting

628
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,880
and some micro Riser I throw that into

629
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,038
the soil and I just been letting that

630
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,000
sit there and cook for it's been a

631
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:10,839
couple couple months now and

632
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,839
everything's going great I I before that

633
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:16,158
I was a synthetic nutrient person though

634
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:18,319
and I would just yeah like I said I

635
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,640
would just throw out my soil but now I'm

636
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:23,158
reusing the soil and I'm starting to go

637
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,880
Organics and I really digging it it's a

638
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:29,278
lot easier too you don't have to feed so

639
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,399
much that's a synthetic one nutrients

640
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:33,240
okay so you got Gaia green as kind of

641
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:35,839
your base nutrition then some warm

642
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,679
castings and micro risal fungi have you

643
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:40,359
been re reusing your soil for several

644
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,720
grows now or or what this has been it's

645
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:46,678
been about I would say about 6

646
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,440
months no almost a year I've been doing

647
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:49,960
that wow that's pretty good time flies

648
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,600
when you're having

649
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,558
fun but yeah I just been uh using

650
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:59,199
reusing that soil and just mixing the

651
00:24:54,558 --> 00:25:01,599
amendments in and doing that for as of

652
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,278
late and it's working with me and so how

653
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:04,398
do you do the feedings throughout

654
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:05,440
because eventually when you do that

655
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:07,239
initial

656
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,159
amending the nutrients are going to

657
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,399
deplete unless you're loading it up

658
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:11,919
there so it's like a super soil you

659
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:13,000
don't have to do any feedings but I

660
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,679
imagine since you're growing larger

661
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,558
plants you're vegging for a little bit

662
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,679
longer there you're probably doing top

663
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,839
dressings throughout how do you

664
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,720
typically do your top dressings and also

665
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,599
do you know what ratios you do of like

666
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,240
diag green and stuff like how much you

667
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,918
tablespoon per gallon or yeah I do a

668
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,558
little bit more than a tablespoon I

669
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:34,159
about 3 tablespoons per gallon is what I

670
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:36,879
try to do I am uh I try to load it up as

671
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,159
much as possible because I getting a

672
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,000
little lazy and I don't want to be in

673
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,480
there every day and mixing soils and

674
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,159
stuff like that so I'll put about 3

675
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,480
tablespoons per gallon um put it on the

676
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:49,520
top soil mix it in and then just water

677
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,720
and be doing that every couple weeks and

678
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,038
recently also when I start to see

679
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,600
problems if I start to see a little bit

680
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,798
of deficiencies or something I'll make a

681
00:25:54,599 --> 00:26:00,639
brew and I started doing the Brews that

682
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:02,398
was pretty cool I did not know like

683
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,240
going into that that you wanted to see

684
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:06,119
the bubbles when you make a brew for

685
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,120
those who don't know if you're putting

686
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:13,398
in uh your uh organic nutrients into

687
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:15,359
your water or a cheesecloth or something

688
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:16,639
like that that you put it to keep it a

689
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,879
little bit keep the water a little bit

690
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,038
cleaner because that's something that I

691
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,760
didn't know that would happen uh the

692
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,119
first time I just threw everything in a

693
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:27,158
bucket and I turned on the AirStone and

694
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,319
I said left it there and I was like okay

695
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:31,159
but I didn't even cover it so now I

696
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:32,879
cover them and I started getting that

697
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:36,600
life the bubbles and everything that you

698
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,799
see on the top um that you're looking

699
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:41,480
for um and I really like those I really

700
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:43,278
dig it how do you brew your tea what's

701
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,519
in there is it just worm castings or is

702
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:46,720
there some Gaia Green in there as well

703
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:51,200
and how long do you usually like Brew

704
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,600
for yeah I put the ga green uh 444 I

705
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,038
think that's the allpurpose

706
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:56,480
or is that I think it's the All Purpose

707
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:59,200
yeah yeah that's put the allp purpose

708
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,319
and I put the flower in it in it and uh

709
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,240
the worm casting I put in with a little

710
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:07,480
bit of bone meal um and some kelp too

711
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,319
that I do have from another company I

712
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,519
have some of that A friend gave it to me

713
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:14,038
so I started adding that into the Brew

714
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:17,398
um I wanted to try molasses but I'm not

715
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:18,960
too sure about how much molasses what

716
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:21,479
kind of molasses cuz I heard that you're

717
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,000
not supposed to use sweetened

718
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,240
molasses I think I'm not too sure about

719
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,798
that one but unsulfured is the one you

720
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,480
want to Target is no preservatives in

721
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,240
there so a lot of people do black strap

722
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,440
molasses cuz a little bit easier to mix

723
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,798
in if you mix it into kind of warmer

724
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,200
water that'll actually mix into the

725
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:41,158
water better than if it was it was

726
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,000
cooler water but yeah unsulfured black

727
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:46,278
strap is okay pretty much the most

728
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,319
common okay so I do that and I stick it

729
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:51,759
into my bucket with some water and

730
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:54,200
AirStone and I brew it for about 3

731
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:56,960
days um some people say the longer the

732
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,919
Brew the long the better it is but I

733
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,240
haven't really experimented too much on

734
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,840
how much is a long like too long of a

735
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,519
brew U but I feel like 3 days is pretty

736
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:08,678
good yeah then I know long bruise can

737
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:09,960
things can go anerobic bad pathogens

738
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:12,440
that happen so you can definitely mess

739
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,440
up with tea I've done it before or I've

740
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,159
fed my plants tea and they were not

741
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,320
happy at all so okay so how long was a

742
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,440
how how long is too long I usually just

743
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:24,839
do 24 hours that's me some people do 36

744
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,038
hours I've heard of some people doing 48

745
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:30,480
hours at the max I haven't heard anybody

746
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:32,440
going 3 days so that was a new one new

747
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,399
one for me so I could probably I'm no

748
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,919
master when it comes to uh when it comes

749
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:39,359
to Brewing compost teas but I've done

750
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:41,759
done them several dozen times in the

751
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:44,199
past don't do them as much anymore I

752
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,278
usually just water and compost for

753
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,600
example but yeah I usually do it when I

754
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:52,319
need to either I'm I'm going organic and

755
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,759
need to resolve a deficiency or if I'm

756
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,359
just looking to boost up the microbial

757
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,158
population in order to have some more

758
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,879
decomposition in the in the medium

759
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,480
faster decomposition you know yeah I'm

760
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,760
going to cut back on that I'll try two

761
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,440
days and we'll see how that goes one day

762
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:08,278
I one day works sometimes I just forget

763
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,798
about it sometimes I'll set it and I'll

764
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:11,319
walk out and I'll just come back a

765
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:13,158
couple days later and be like oh no the

766
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:15,278
plants oh no the

767
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:16,919
brew and then I got to do what I got to

768
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:20,319
do and get it in

769
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:22,880
there that happens man we lives are busy

770
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:24,798
busy busy do you dilute the tea now when

771
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,159
you create the tea you brew it now are

772
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:28,599
you diluting it in water at any Ratio or

773
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:30,960
anything are you just feeding that

774
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:32,480
solution directly to the plants yeah I

775
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,360
just feed that solution directly to the

776
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,919
plants I uh yeah I know I haven't

777
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,918
deluded it or anything I haven't thought

778
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:40,720
of

779
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,559
that the plants so far they're loving it

780
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,440
so far I haven't had any problems be

781
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:47,798
size pest is the only thing that I've

782
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,200
been dealing with in my girl room okay

783
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:50,759
got it so the te's are working out for

784
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,000
you so that's good to hear yeah now I

785
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:54,398
want to flip it back to the nutrients

786
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,919
now you said you've been doing Organics

787
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:59,239
for about 6 months now before that you

788
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:00,559
were doing doing synthetics so I kind of

789
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,839
want to dive a little bit into

790
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:03,678
synthetics we have a lot of people that

791
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:04,959
listen to here that use synthetics

792
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,278
particularly when growing large plants

793
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,278
they want their Precision feeding they

794
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:10,278
want everything to be soluble in order

795
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:11,798
to try to help get faster growth what

796
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:13,440
were you using for synthetic nutrients

797
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:16,240
and how were you going about your

798
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,440
feedings uh for the synthetic nutrients

799
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,759
when I first started I was using uh

800
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,360
General

801
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:26,000
Hydroponics um and then I had made the

802
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:28,278
switch over to Dutch Pro nutrients from

803
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,359
you guys were but that was back in the

804
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:32,000
day when we were you guys were

805
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:34,278
collaborating with them and I really

806
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,919
like those nutrients because the general

807
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:39,679
hydroponic was already phed so soon as

808
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:44,720
you added it to your water your water

809
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:47,440
would be at 6.2 and so 6.2 6.5 whatever

810
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,038
whatever up pH at

811
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,640
um and it was easier so you just mix it

812
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,599
f your plants boom there you go and so I

813
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,960
did that for a while but then I started

814
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:00,839
getting deficiencies and deficiencies

815
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,519
started plaguing me all the time so then

816
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:05,759
I made the switch to Organics which I

817
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,679
feel is working better for me at the

818
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,960
time right now but I will every once in

819
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,639
a while still throw some synthetic in if

820
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,079
I need to if I'm just like hey this

821
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:15,918
plant needs an nitrogen right now right

822
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:19,759
now here boom just throw some nitrogen

823
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:22,440
on some uh veg General hydroponic feed

824
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:25,558
so the Sanic approach yeah yeah there

825
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,480
you go that's what it is some people

826
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:28,839
swear by that they and I've done it

827
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,360
several times in the past you know start

828
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:33,720
out with the organic medium to begin

829
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:36,079
there's organic nutrients in there then

830
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,278
adding in some synthetics along with top

831
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:39,359
dressing of organic amendments and yeah

832
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:40,960
getting through grows like that that's

833
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,479
some my best Grows Where I combine the

834
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,880
two so yeah and I really don't feel that

835
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,319
you have to go one or the other I feel

836
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,760
like the grow it's your grow if you feel

837
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,678
like you want to add some synthetics in

838
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:54,759
there go for it man it's you know it's

839
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,960
your thing you can do whatever you want

840
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:58,759
there is no set science to this nobody's

841
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,399
ever said hey man you got to do it this

842
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:02,720
way or else you know well there are

843
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:05,000
people who will say that but you know

844
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,399
they there's some people who will try to

845
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,359
make you do what they want you know or

846
00:32:07,398 --> 00:32:11,798
grow how they want but I feel that you

847
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:14,319
need to experience this you need to uh

848
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:16,879
experiment you need to see find out what

849
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,519
works for you the best yeah I completely

850
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,399
agree and yeah there's nothing worse

851
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,798
than a backseat grower somebody that

852
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:23,359
comes in and tells you how to grow your

853
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:26,079
plants oh

854
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:28,359
man feedback like we need to do this

855
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:31,000
this this this now change this and then

856
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:32,240
do this and it's like dude what okay

857
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,319
that's the way you do it but like I want

858
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,759
to do it a little bit different you know

859
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:36,519
I have my own style let me let me do

860
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:39,558
what I'm doing you know I'll ask you for

861
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:42,200
help if I want it you know it's funny

862
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:44,119
yeah there was one guy uh yeah exactly

863
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,960
how you said that I'll ask you for help

864
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:48,558
if I want it right there was one guy out

865
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,038
there on Instagram who was uh he sent me

866
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:51,759
a message and was like dude you need to

867
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:53,240
do this this this and I was like all

868
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,480
right bro I was like yeah I already did

869
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,278
that and he just took total offense to

870
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:01,399
it and was like I've been growing 40

871
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:03,000
years you need to you need to like or he

872
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:04,079
sent me a video too was like shaking his

873
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,159
pants what do you think I don't know

874
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:09,199
what I'm talking about I'm like bro

875
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,799
that's not what I said I just said that

876
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,480
I did that already damn but I could

877
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:16,200
totally understand too so some people I

878
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,798
could see how some people are so

879
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,080
passionate about the way that they grow

880
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:22,519
you know and they they some people deep

881
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:25,278
down they're just trying to help and

882
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:27,399
they don't like being told that they're

883
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:29,079
not doing right which I think they're

884
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:30,798
getting defensive you know they have

885
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:33,439
that

886
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:36,319
inner insecurities or whatever it is and

887
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,679
they just feel like Tash hour was easier

888
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,398
thing than to sit there and talk to

889
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,120
somebody and actually be like okay man

890
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:43,879
my bad I was tripping because I have

891
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:46,000
insecurities you know that's just so

892
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,639
hard for some people to say yeah I can

893
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,839
totally I totally get what you mean by

894
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:52,798
that for sure I want to bring it back to

895
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:54,119
container size and type for a minute now

896
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:55,839
you mentioned you start out in one

897
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:58,038
gallons then you go to three then you go

898
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:59,359
to Five you've tried to go to 7 gallons

899
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:00,839
before but you felt like that was a

900
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:03,519
little bit too much is that when you

901
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:05,638
were growing with Organics or synthetics

902
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,639
and then also those plastic pots or

903
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:10,598
fabric pots or what so that was when I

904
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,480
was doing all of it actually I still do

905
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:18,320
synthetic and organic in that same way

906
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:20,480
um and I use fabric pots I tried some

907
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,480
plastic 1gallon pots but I just feel

908
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,480
like they're not getting the air into

909
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,878
the root system the way that fabric pots

910
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,480
do and I really like I understand that

911
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:31,279
some people like the way that the root

912
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,760
system bounces around and starts to curl

913
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,119
around with the plastic but I don't I

914
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,879
like the root system to be able to

915
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,879
because I feel that that leaves room for

916
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:42,319
root rot if the roots are bouncing

917
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,199
around they're getting tangled up too

918
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,159
much right so that's why I only use

919
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:48,519
fabric pots ever since I've been started

920
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:52,760
growing I just did fabric pots it's

921
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:54,398
easier I like the way that they um like

922
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,399
they could soak up water from the

923
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:57,719
outside like say say you got fungus

924
00:34:56,398 --> 00:34:59,118
gnats

925
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:01,559
and you want to start watering on the

926
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,000
bottom you know it's easier for the

927
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:06,400
fabric pots for them to soak up the

928
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,920
water uh and also I

929
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,240
like that the root system supposedly

930
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,000
when the root system goes out and it

931
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:13,879
hits the fabric it doesn't bounce around

932
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,719
it just stops right there and it starts

933
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,680
to get bigger and bigger and so uh the

934
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:21,199
root system is very healthy in there I

935
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:23,039
think it's healthier with fabric pots

936
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:25,480
yeah they're different and I I did the

937
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,960
one gallon to three gallon to 5 gallon

938
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,679
to S gallon one of my other friends he

939
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,199
does like I don't even know I think like

940
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:36,118
a 20-gallon or something pot in his

941
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:38,598
plants and I was like bro you are a

942
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:39,800
Savage if I did that my plants would be

943
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:41,838
the size of the

944
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,119
house Different Strokes for different

945
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:44,559
folks yeah there are so many different

946
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,640
ways to go about it some people use

947
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:49,519
plastic some people use fabric some

948
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:53,118
people hate plastic love Fabric and vice

949
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:55,119
versa so me I do like the plastic pots

950
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,079
to begin but I did switch over to the

951
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,800
Grassroots fabric pots the living soil

952
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:01,720
fabric Poss with the liner because uh

953
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,039
one thing I learned from Tyler over at

954
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:05,118
Grassroots big shout out to him is he

955
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:07,119
had mentioned that you know it's really

956
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,960
not natural for when you're grow with

957
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,480
the living soil or Organics having the

958
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,720
medium dryo from all sides so they

959
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,440
created one with a liner in the middle

960
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,959
of the pot basically like from I think

961
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,639
it's like 2 in up and upward so it's a

962
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,318
little bit of Iration on the bottom more

963
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:26,440
than you'd get in a plastic pot but it

964
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:28,880
it prevents all the sides from drying

965
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,599
out to dries up from the top down

966
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,640
naturally like it kind of does in nature

967
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:33,920
so those are the ones I've been I've

968
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:35,838
been really digging but Different

969
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,920
Strokes for different folks some people

970
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:41,440
certainly get away with just doing uh

971
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:44,039
Organics with fabric pots so yeah and I

972
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,440
uh just recently started washing my pots

973
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:48,119
um I went and bought new pots every time

974
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,079
so when I first started growing I was

975
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:52,559
wasting a lot of money I feel like I

976
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:56,200
didn't reuse my soil I didn't rewash my

977
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:58,440
pots I you know I just went and got new

978
00:36:56,199 --> 00:37:01,358
stuff and after a while it started

979
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,480
adding up that money adds up so uh

980
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,799
recently just started washing the pots

981
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,760
and I feel like it works as long as you

982
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,318
run them through two times boom

983
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,400
everything comes out nice and clean and

984
00:37:09,318 --> 00:37:14,119
you can just reuse it absolutely yeah

985
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,680
reuse where you can and save money yeah

986
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:18,160
so when you transplant are you doing

987
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:19,118
anything special like some people what

988
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:20,759
they'll do is they'll sprinkle micro

989
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,079
risal fungi on the roots during

990
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,240
transplant I like to do that I also like

991
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:27,079
to put a scoop of worm castings in the

992
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:29,199
bottom of the hole I personally feel

993
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:31,560
like that helps with growth prevents the

994
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:33,639
transplant shock quote transplant shock

995
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:35,199
that that you can get sometimes if you

996
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:36,519
disturb the roots too much it kind of

997
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,199
just looks like the plant's slowing down

998
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:40,318
a little bit before it bounces back

999
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:42,078
typically when I'm I'm sprinkling

1000
00:37:40,318 --> 00:37:43,880
microle fungi and then adding in the

1001
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,839
scoop of worm castings to the bottom of

1002
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,400
the hole growth just seems to continue

1003
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:50,559
on without any sort of stunt do you do

1004
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,400
anything during transplant like that or

1005
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:56,279
or what I do actually I do exactly what

1006
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,318
you do I uh transplant and I put the

1007
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,599
micro RIS it on the root system and put

1008
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:02,480
a little bit of worm casting on the

1009
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:05,160
bottom too cuz I feel like it's just

1010
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,719
that makes sense um to put that right

1011
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:08,358
there while you're transplanting I mean

1012
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,279
you have it all open you might as well

1013
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:13,000
get it to the to the root system while

1014
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:16,960
it's open I also when I do I do break

1015
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,239
the bottom of the uh the root system up

1016
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,880
I break that open just a little bit you

1017
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:22,399
want to be careful though when you're

1018
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,640
transplanting you want to make sure that

1019
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,760
your soil is very dry because if it's

1020
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:29,960
not as dry for me at least um when I go

1021
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,200
to transfer the soil will fall apart Off

1022
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:34,920
The Roots if it's wet so the drier it is

1023
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:36,598
the more you pull it out and it'll stay

1024
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,559
in one spot and then you can drop it

1025
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:40,200
into the thing if it's a little bit wet

1026
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:42,078
it'll fall apart and that's when I have

1027
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:44,239
trouble with my transplants and then

1028
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,160
you'll get the shock and everything like

1029
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:49,919
that to happen but when it's really dry

1030
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:51,679
I don't see any shock and yeah I just

1031
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,079
put a little bit of microa and some worm

1032
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:56,039
casting on there cool let's get into the

1033
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,200
meat and potatoes of this whole talk

1034
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:58,279
right I think the rest of the things

1035
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,199
that we're going to be talking about

1036
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,599
really contributes to larger plants

1037
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:05,279
right so first off how long do you veg

1038
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:07,838
the plants for so my veg I veg for a

1039
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,519
long time I will read the plant as I

1040
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:12,358
like to say which is making sure that's

1041
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:15,239
big enough I want to say it's about 7

1042
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:20,598
weeks is how long I veg for maybe even

1043
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:22,279
eight some sometimes uh but in that veg

1044
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:26,480
time I'm

1045
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:30,160
topping and I'm uh training like crazy

1046
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:33,039
czy so like I said earlier I sit there

1047
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:35,039
and it's like the pregame you know

1048
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:38,480
getting the plant ready for the Super

1049
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:40,639
Bowl so the long veg is something that I

1050
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,400
really stand by cuz I want my plants to

1051
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:45,440
be very healthy very ready to go into

1052
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,400
this flower stage and produce the

1053
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,880
biggest um flowers that I can okay so a

1054
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,400
7 week veg on that then you flip out of

1055
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,000
flow I don't know if I asked you or if

1056
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,760
you mentioned how many plant is that for

1057
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,519
like one plant in a full by4 or how many

1058
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,880
plants are you putting in that full by4

1059
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:05,679
that you mentioned you have oh um what I

1060
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:10,358
would do is I I usually stick it to

1061
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:12,399
about three plants in a 4x4 that I uh

1062
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:14,358
because I find that four is just too big

1063
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,880
the way that I grow my plants grow so

1064
00:40:14,358 --> 00:40:18,759
big that they Bush out really big and so

1065
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,680
when I'm starting

1066
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:24,280
to cuz I uh do the technique from pigees

1067
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:26,358
420 where I break the membrane on the

1068
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:29,040
stem right and I'll break the membrane

1069
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:30,838
and I'll set the plant down I'll super

1070
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:33,159
crop it right is that what it's called

1071
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:36,400
yes so I'll just be super cropping on

1072
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:38,358
top of topping so I really train this

1073
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,200
plant to go out because it gets very

1074
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:42,759
bushy so by the time that I put it into

1075
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:46,719
the 4x4 t0 I can only fit three plants

1076
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:48,280
in before they start to because it looks

1077
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:50,759
like H you know you got a lot of room

1078
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,000
but once they start to flower wow these

1079
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,400
plants start to fill the whole tent out

1080
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,920
and then there's no room for you to get

1081
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,240
in and so I always always have to have

1082
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:02,358
room for myself to be able to get in to

1083
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:05,439
get into the B bottom of it to clean up

1084
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:07,440
the bottom uh stems or you know do all

1085
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,880
the maintenance everything got it so

1086
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,639
three plants and you're trying to fill

1087
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,400
it wall to wall so how tall are they

1088
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:15,318
typically before flipping so you've got

1089
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,079
you know from the ground up about a foot

1090
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:18,519
for the grill pot how tall is it before

1091
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:20,359
you kind of flipping CU you got space

1092
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:21,480
constraints too right so you're doing

1093
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:23,078
your training you're doing the the

1094
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,880
topping low stress training super

1095
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:26,760
cropping and then it you're you're

1096
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,880
shaping it the way you want it to ma CU

1097
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:32,079
out has grow space and then how tall is

1098
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:35,480
it really before flipping to flower I'd

1099
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:38,800
say about 2 feet over the one foot pot

1100
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,599
so it'll be about 3T Al together um and

1101
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,318
then you got to en count you got to take

1102
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:44,599
in count that there is that stretch

1103
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:46,000
going to happen to a flowers so you know

1104
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:47,559
you got to be ready for that one that's

1105
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,838
one thing that I have to deal with a lot

1106
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:51,400
is growing big plants you have to be

1107
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:54,799
ready

1108
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,680
for the stretch to happen and you have

1109
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,839
to be ready for how much room you're

1110
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:59,440
going to have from the light and the

1111
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:02,119
plant because you don't want the plant

1112
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,559
touching the light but when growing big

1113
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,760
plants it's going to happen sometimes it

1114
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:08,279
definitely happens man I've had so many

1115
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,680
plants outgrow and come up into light

1116
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,680
you know I went on vacation one time

1117
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:14,799
came back and the plants were grown into

1118
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:16,639
the light yeah luckily I was able to

1119
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,160
just prune off some branches and I was

1120
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,838
good to go but it certainly can be a

1121
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:22,960
problem where it kind of over grows the

1122
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:24,440
grow space so knowing when to flip

1123
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,199
making sure you're not overing your

1124
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,280
plants to where all of a sudden you're

1125
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:29,879
running into high constraints and you

1126
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,640
have to prune when you don't want to

1127
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,599
prune and so on and so forth so knowing

1128
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:37,838
exactly when to flip and how bit how

1129
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:40,640
long to your plants are super super key

1130
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,880
so one thing that I've ran into also is

1131
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:44,598
because I have a Perpetual grow so I

1132
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,200
have a bunch of you know stages I got my

1133
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:48,720
veg tent I got my flour tent I got my

1134
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:52,799
clone tent I got my drying tent right

1135
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:54,519
well if these tents aren't perfectly syn

1136
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,599
then sometimes you're going to have to

1137
00:42:54,519 --> 00:43:00,559
veg for longer and the veg t than you

1138
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:02,280
would want to and so that that happens a

1139
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:05,720
lot more often than I would like it to

1140
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,680
happen um and so in turn what happens is

1141
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:09,838
when I move it to the flower tent we

1142
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,679
have the plat touching the lights and

1143
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:13,279
you're going to have to prune it and one

1144
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:16,039
thing that I've noticed that freaked me

1145
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,880
out the first time that I saw it was the

1146
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:21,599
leaf touching the I think it's the red

1147
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,838
diode um that gives you the Red Spectrum

1148
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,079
it'll burn it'll burn the plant and it's

1149
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:29,159
burnt and so you want to be careful for

1150
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:30,920
that guys just be out there keep an eye

1151
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:33,399
on it just make sure that if a leaf is

1152
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:36,920
hitting the light it will burn in uh

1153
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:40,960
prune it down if you have to um it will

1154
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:43,920
will stunt the plant a little bit but I

1155
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,559
feel like it'll be okay in the long run

1156
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,599
how about pruning techniques like

1157
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:50,519
lollipopping or defoliation are you

1158
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:53,440
doing those things at all and when yes I

1159
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:55,440
I love the lollipop and default like I'm

1160
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,559
in there defaulting all like crazy

1161
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,720
because the rule that I feel like is you

1162
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:03,280
want all the energy to go up to these

1163
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,000
colas right so you don't want to waste

1164
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,200
too much energy down here with these

1165
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,838
popcorn buds that are just going to be

1166
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:11,719
if you're hand trimming they're just

1167
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:13,239
hard to trim nobody likes to waste time

1168
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:16,759
on the on the popcorn buds when you're

1169
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:19,759
hand trimming um so in return

1170
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:22,480
lollipop so I go in there and I

1171
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,760
defoliate and I lollipop like crazy so I

1172
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,639
will just

1173
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,640
leave I'll just be looking for colas my

1174
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:32,078
my my my goal is to get the big colas I

1175
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:35,838
want I want these fat just beautiful

1176
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:38,359
looking ones so um yeah I lollipop and I

1177
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:40,679
train like crazy and do you do that in

1178
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:42,519
veg before flip well in particular maybe

1179
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,078
break down one by one for lollipopping

1180
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:45,800
are you only doing an AEG before

1181
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,200
flipping with flour are you also

1182
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:51,800
lollipopping in flour at some point or

1183
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:54,000
throughout flour I do it I in flower

1184
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,119
also I do it in veg I get the plant look

1185
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,039
in the way that I really like which is

1186
00:44:56,119 --> 00:45:00,160
lollip popped and topped and super

1187
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:02,000
cropped right so she's throughout those

1188
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:03,838
seven weeks she's going to be looking

1189
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,280
very nice before I put her in the flow

1190
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:07,199
now when I put her in the flower there's

1191
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,720
going to be these these Bud sites that

1192
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,279
are going to show up on the bottom that

1193
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:12,439
a lot of Growers you know what I'm

1194
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,040
talking about you'll have that one

1195
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,960
little nug just sticking out on the

1196
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:17,679
bottom stand that's just like really

1197
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,000
developing and it looks nice but it's

1198
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:22,639
taking an energy away from the top so

1199
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,400
it's got to go and so yeah you just go

1200
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:26,960
down there and just be picking off

1201
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:31,480
whatever's uh on the bottom I try to

1202
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:34,358
make it about a foot from the pot

1203
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,599
nothing from under there just completely

1204
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:39,159
stripped and all the stems are up here

1205
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:43,680
in turn what happens in that time though

1206
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:46,318
is you will get flopp this is a coin a

1207
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:49,318
term that I I want a coin but it's the

1208
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:51,480
flage it's a real big problem and that

1209
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:53,920
is your you know your buds get too big

1210
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,079
and they just start flopping over and

1211
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,800
when they start flopping over that's

1212
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:01,640
when you need a trer

1213
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:03,359
or what I use is the yo-yo hangers use

1214
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:04,759
those those are really nice they just

1215
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:06,719
hang up on the top of your tent and just

1216
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:09,359
come down and you just hook it onto your

1217
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:11,159
bud and it'll hold it up and another

1218
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:13,799
product that I've used is the umbrella

1219
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:16,960
trellis now have you heard of this one I

1220
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:19,960
had the owner on here oh episode before

1221
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,400
huh good good yeah uh the umbrella Tris

1222
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,960
man that's one product that I'm STI

1223
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:26,160
standing by if you learn how to use it I

1224
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,599
didn't know how to use it as well so I

1225
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:30,399
asked uh the owner the maker and he

1226
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:33,000
showed me what he does in his grow and I

1227
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,599
was like oh now that's how it's supposed

1228
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,519
to look it looked very beautiful if you

1229
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:41,079
put two trellises on there then you have

1230
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:43,639
the ability to take out the plant out of

1231
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:45,119
the uh spot or wherever that you have

1232
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:47,440
and you still have be able to hold the

1233
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,318
nugs up and everything so the umbrella

1234
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,480
trellis is really cool invention I like

1235
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:53,119
that one some people don't like it but I

1236
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,838
do that's pretty cool yeah I was going

1237
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:57,838
to ask you about support for the plants

1238
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:59,679
and you mentioned trellis net and the

1239
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:01,719
yo-yos and stuff my next question is if

1240
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:03,598
you're just using a regular trellis net

1241
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:06,480
are you doing just one layer or you

1242
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:10,400
doing multiple layers I actually have

1243
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,280
only done trellising maybe three times

1244
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,800
and there was one time I did one layer

1245
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:17,760
and then one time I did the two layers

1246
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,760
uh but like I said I need to have room

1247
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:25,240
for me to get into the girl room so or

1248
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,520
into the grow tent I can't fit in under

1249
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:28,598
a trer

1250
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:31,920
get under there and have to water

1251
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:34,318
because I'm still hand watering too and

1252
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,200
uh even though I do have a blue mat

1253
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:38,639
system that I need to hook up and get

1254
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:42,078
going uh which I had a question for you

1255
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:44,358
on that but we'll ask that later uh yeah

1256
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,760
trellises have never been my deal I I've

1257
00:47:44,358 --> 00:47:48,558
never really liked trellises I just

1258
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:51,240
can't get over the fact that I can't get

1259
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,400
in there and then when the plant is done

1260
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:55,519
that you have to be able to get that

1261
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,000
trellis off the butts and it's so hard

1262
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:59,358
and back in the day when I was doing

1263
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,679
more synthetic nutrients I would have to

1264
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:04,159
flush a lot more often than not right

1265
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:06,039
well I mean a lot of times having a

1266
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:09,000
flush inside of a tent and move that

1267
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:12,039
plant out is just while it's strapped

1268
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:16,519
down to a trellis is just crazy crazy

1269
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:18,719
impossible I I don't like it and so yeah

1270
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:20,239
I don't really like trellises too much

1271
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:23,000
fair enough now there's a lot of people

1272
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:24,959
listening in here that are homeg Growers

1273
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,599
maybe they're newer and they want to

1274
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,079
grow large plants indoors what advice do

1275
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,680
you have for those folks that are kind

1276
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:33,440
of just getting started growing large

1277
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:36,799
plants indoors um the advice that I

1278
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:40,240
would give them would be to do a large a

1279
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:43,000
longer veg the longer veg time will give

1280
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:45,078
you a bigger plant and flower and yeah

1281
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,519
you just got to be be patient too you

1282
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:48,720
got to be patient with it because I know

1283
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:50,838
you want to get it into the flower tent

1284
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:53,439
you want to you know get a flower in and

1285
00:48:50,838 --> 00:48:58,000
get all the the good excitement out of

1286
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:59,880
it but it's better to have the I like to

1287
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,679
put it in child kind of you want your

1288
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,720
child nice and healthy right before you

1289
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:07,159
go set him into football or something

1290
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:10,439
like that right so that's the way I put

1291
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:12,960
it try to get that the veg is the most

1292
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,720
important thing to me I think if the veg

1293
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,119
is nice and good and perfect then you

1294
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:18,679
shouldn't you should just be able to

1295
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:20,240
flow right through flour but we all know

1296
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:22,679
that that's not what really happens

1297
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:24,439
sometimes sometimes a flour you know

1298
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:26,399
problems arise and you're just going to

1299
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,960
have to deal with that but

1300
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,639
if you have a real long veg you'll have

1301
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:32,679
a real big plant speaking of problems

1302
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:36,199
what problems have you run into and how

1303
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:38,199
did you resolve them oh man oh man what

1304
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:40,798
are we talking on problems you mean like

1305
00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:42,358
best or just anything that's going to

1306
00:49:40,798 --> 00:49:45,119
prevent you from growing large plants or

1307
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:46,279
hinders from large Plant development

1308
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,240
what you're trying to you know your end

1309
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:51,160
goal there the problems that I have one

1310
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:53,239
thing in growing big plants is you're

1311
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:55,759
going to you're going to lose a lot of

1312
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:58,279
room uh these plants take up a lot of

1313
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,160
room they take up a lot of water they

1314
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,559
take up a lot of nutrients you're going

1315
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:03,879
to start be getting a lot of

1316
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:05,440
deficiencies because the bigger the

1317
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:08,318
plant the more they're going to want

1318
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,000
energy they need more more uh nutrients

1319
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:13,880
to create this energy to keep them

1320
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:17,480
healthy to keep them thick and um you

1321
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:19,200
know wantan to live so yeah they're

1322
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,480
going to be having more deficiencies is

1323
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:23,639
one thing that I've noticed that happens

1324
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,760
to me a lot um also the flage when

1325
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:26,000
you're growing big plants you're going

1326
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,839
to have that flop

1327
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,960
so be ready to put a trellis on there or

1328
00:50:28,838 --> 00:50:32,798
yo-yo hangers or something to hold up

1329
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,760
those big buds because those buds are

1330
00:50:32,798 --> 00:50:35,798
going to get really big and they're

1331
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,640
going to start hanging another thing

1332
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:40,239
it's guys just room because you're not

1333
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:42,480
going to be able to put I mean you could

1334
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:44,719
put nine plants in there and try to grow

1335
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,760
nine big plants but you're just going to

1336
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:49,598
be having too many things grabb together

1337
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,200
not enough air circulation because

1338
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:55,519
there's going to just be too much uh

1339
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:58,159
foliation in there uh yeah so that's why

1340
00:50:55,519 --> 00:51:00,759
I keep it to about three plants at a

1341
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:04,239
time some people might want to do more

1342
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:06,280
more power to you but yeah big plants

1343
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:08,399
you're going to be ready for flopp this

1344
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,640
one flopping is something that happens

1345
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,639
to be a lot some people might want to do

1346
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:14,199
less than three plants right some people

1347
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:15,598
some people like to do just one plant

1348
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:18,159
right in the middle of their full by4

1349
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:20,400
and veget for that long period and put

1350
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:22,239
it into a trellis for example is there a

1351
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,639
specific reason why you do three plants

1352
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:27,118
instead of like one plant just oh no

1353
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:30,519
I've done one plant before I've done one

1354
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:35,039
plant in a sgon pot and that was a

1355
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:38,519
massive plant massive it took up like it

1356
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:40,639
might have been three plants in one like

1357
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:42,280
yeah I've done that before and people if

1358
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:45,279
you follow me on Instagram you've seen

1359
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:47,319
that plant that plant was huge I feel

1360
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,559
like it beat me up it was almost like

1361
00:51:47,318 --> 00:51:51,960
Little Shop of hores it was like feed me

1362
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:51,960
SE

1363
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,159
more so I was a little intimidated by

1364
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,480
this plant because they get really big

1365
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:00,759
man and one thing that I've noticed that

1366
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:04,318
if anybody is grown Outdoors they know

1367
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:06,319
that Outdoors they can get huge cuz I

1368
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:08,480
did that one time I wanted to experiment

1369
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:10,920
and I was like well I grow really big

1370
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,559
plants indoors so let's see what happens

1371
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:16,680
if I put it outdoor and so I took one of

1372
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:18,480
my strains that I cloned out and that

1373
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:23,440
had been doing indoors and I put it

1374
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:26,920
outdoors and Jesus Lord it was huge

1375
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:30,000
brother oh my God two plants I had out

1376
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:33,119
there and they just took up a lot of

1377
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,159
space and I had to deal with flage which

1378
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:37,559
is one thing that I'm always dealing

1379
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:39,679
with but they came out good and I just

1380
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:43,240
wanted to see how big it would get and

1381
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:45,159
that was in a 30 gallon pot so yeah that

1382
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:47,318
was pretty fun nice experience right

1383
00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:48,519
there and i' very I highly recommend

1384
00:52:47,318 --> 00:52:51,239
everybody to

1385
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:53,318
experiment experiment with everything

1386
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:55,279
see how big you could get your PL see if

1387
00:52:53,318 --> 00:52:56,920
it's if it's something that you're into

1388
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,240
to if you're something that you can

1389
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,599
handle if you can't handle it keep them

1390
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:03,759
smaller easy I think that's some really

1391
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:05,318
good advice man is there anything else

1392
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,880
we need to cover I'm trying to think

1393
00:53:05,318 --> 00:53:09,000
here when it relates to growing large

1394
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,519
plants indoors we covered lighting

1395
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,960
environment we got soil

1396
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:16,519
nutrition training we did almost

1397
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,880
everything here right anything else you

1398
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:20,880
can think of that we should talk about

1399
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,160
for large plants growing them indoors no

1400
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,838
not really I was just going to say

1401
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:27,399
patience patience is one thing that is a

1402
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:29,440
key in growing in general um you're

1403
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:33,480
going to have to have patience for this

1404
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,400
if you want to have the best product or

1405
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,760
the

1406
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,440
best you know the best product that you

1407
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:41,799
could produce because you're you're

1408
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:43,720
putting in all your time in this and you

1409
00:53:41,798 --> 00:53:46,440
don't want to put all your time in for

1410
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:47,838
nothing right you want to have also one

1411
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,838
thing I wanted to point out is I want to

1412
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:53,519
have everybody out there not not to

1413
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:55,519
stress too much about it because I I I

1414
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:57,199
try to nurture a lot of new Growers and

1415
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:59,079
I tell them like don't stress about it

1416
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:02,318
you're supposed to be having fun let's

1417
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:04,160
have fun on this uh don't take it too

1418
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:05,679
seriously because as long as you gain

1419
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:08,199
that knowledge you could always do it

1420
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:10,039
again if something goes wrong your plant

1421
00:54:08,199 --> 00:54:11,838
dies or whatever you can always plant

1422
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:15,079
another seed and you could give it

1423
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:18,078
another shot and so just keep up with it

1424
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:20,240
man that's the advice I have for people

1425
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:22,599
keep with it and don't give up and have

1426
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:24,519
fun well said well I appreciate you

this has been cool to hear about how you

1429
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,318
do it how you grow large plants indoors

1430
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:32,199
tell the listeners how they can find you

1431
