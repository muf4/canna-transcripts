1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,839
coming up on garden talk if someone had

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,839
a pretty good base mix and had used some

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,839
synthetic nutrients in it at a time or

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,960
two they could probably still turn that

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,439
into a living soil environment over

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,080
a short period of time the microbes will

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:20,559
remediate quickly they'll remediate just

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:23,439
about anything quickly anything really

9
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,719
from the ocean is going to be salty and

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,759
possibly

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:30,320
contaminated we also like planting stuff

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,640
like carrots and radishes and things

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,238
that are going to penetrate the soil

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,520
and feed everything in the soil or below

15
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,479
the soil the quality is absolutely

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,440
higher

17
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,398
the more research you do up front and

18
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,558
the

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,039
more prepared you are going into that

20
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,919
situation the better your turnout's

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,920
going to be for sure

22
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,238

things such as transitioning from

synthetic to organic ferments

33
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,959

thanks for asking excited to talk to you

82
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,080
today we're going to talk about a whole

83
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,759
bunch of things i think are going to be

84
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,200
valuable to the audience listening in

85
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,679
we're going to talk about transitioning

86
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,119
from synthetics to organics we're also

87
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,239
going to get into things such as

88
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,280
ferments

89
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,280
water-soluble mineral inputs cover crops

90
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,120
and so much more but first before we get

91
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,878
into those things what we like to do is

92
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,239
an introduction so can you tell us a

93
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,560
little bit about yourself and kind of

94
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,799
how you got into gardening

95
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,400
you bet my name is james i'm the owner

96
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,080
of red dirt raised

97
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,519
and we have

98
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,640
a small

99
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,239
family ran medicinal farm

100
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:39,039
medicinal plant farm in oklahoma

101
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,719
we started it in 2019

102
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,359
and

103
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:47,039
have been gardening all my life

104
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,840
other types of plants vegetables

105
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,840
house plants

106
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,359
but have been commercially

107
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:58,079
commercially farming in oklahoma since

108
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,799
2019.

109
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,319
that's awesome and i know you i believe

110
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,560
you started out

111
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:06,639
with synthetics right and then you kind

112
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,840
of transitioned over organics and that's

113
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,759
really what we're going to talk about

114
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,280
today first kind of

115
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,959
before talking about the transition and

116
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,799
how to go about it

117
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,560
general question here which i mean i

118
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,840
know the answer but

119
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,000
i think it's important for the audience

120
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,918
to know the answer as well which is why

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,240
make the change from synthetic to

122
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:27,519
organic

123
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,079
for us uh it was all about quality

124
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,079
initially

125
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,879
if you've

126
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,560
if you've tasted the difference in an

127
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,199
organically grown

128
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,199
tomato

129
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,120
as to

130
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,600
compare to what you may go buy at the

131
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,160
grocery store

132
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,439
you'll know immediately you know the

133
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,240
flavor

134
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,560
uh is is quite a bit

135
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,360
stronger in that organically grown

136
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,280
tomato

137
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:05,520
same thing goes for medicinal plants

138
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,959
the quality is absolutely higher

139
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,799
you're going to see a

140
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:14,879
more diverse terpene profile um

141
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,240
higher cannabinoid content altogether

142
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,399
and then

143
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,400
you know for us a lot of it had to do

144
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,399
with sustainability

145
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,279
um

146
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:27,599
being able to

147
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,000
provide your plants with the food they

148
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,000
need

149
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,319
instead of using a bottle

150
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,959
uh

151
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,199
using something from the earth

152
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,120
or maybe even you know a ferment or

153
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,478
something that you have

154
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,478
uh made there yourself

155
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,960
but

156
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,160
now it was uh it was a number of reasons

157
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,478
for us

158
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,840
um you know if you're running a farm

159
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,959
commercially

160
00:05:53,839 --> 00:06:01,198
uh the bottom line is always gonna

161
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:04,159
help steer decisions and overhead on any

162
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,280
size farm isn't small

163
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,720
so

164
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,918
you know that was another really

165
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,600
attractive uh selling point for for me

166
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:12,879
trying to choose what direction we were

167
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,600
gonna go

168
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,759
uh but it all started with quality

169
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,439
if you've had organically grown

170
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,439
medicinal plants

171
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,038
you know the difference

172
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,038
one major thing you mentioned is

173
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,599
sustainability right now certainly there

174
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:30,318
are pros and cons to growing both ways i

175
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,080
believe sustainability really stands out

176
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:36,319
there you know going out and spending

177
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:38,159
money on nutrients every single round

178
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,400
can be expensive and you can certainly

179
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,759
save money going to organic side of

180
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,758
things i think that's a lot of reason

181
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,360
why folks transition to the organic side

182
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,520
of things because you can save a

183
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,960
significant amount of money if you do

184
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,639
things right transitioning over to

185
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,000
organics so i'm glad you mentioned that

186
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,680
one

187
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
most my audience are home growers right

188
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,840
so they're in containers they maybe buy

189
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,759
a bag soiled and they're starting to use

190
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,598
synthetic nutrients oftentimes what

191
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,360
they're doing is

192
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,038
throwing out that medium right they're

193
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,160
throwing out after they finish their

194
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,000
grow

195
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,599
they're usually throwing out that soil

196
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,680
and then buying a new bag of soil

197
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,680
starting fresh the reason why is because

198
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,199
things such as salt buildup can occur

199
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,959
which can you know once you plant your

200
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,960
next crop you could potentially your

201
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,519
higher risk of running into issues also

202
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,519
there can be a nutrient imbalance over

203
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,279
time that can happen within the medium

204
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,719
now you're out on a farm right so

205
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,279
there's no like

206
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,440
there's no throwing away the soil and

207
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,279
starting fresh right you have to kind of

208
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,279
you've already used synthetics you have

209
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,598
to use that same soil in order to

210
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,439
transition to organics so what are the

211
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:42,000
steps to kind of go about transitioning

212
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:45,279
from synthetic to organic

213
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,360
so depending on scale um you know

214
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,439
that's that's there's a few factors

215
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,520
there that are gonna um

216
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,399
i think really line out the steps for

217
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,799
people

218
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,839
um for a tent grower

219
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,360
uh somebody at home uh with a small

220
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,038
garden

221
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,840
you could just simply

222
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,399
well

223
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,478
education is key first of all

224
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,399
try to educate yourself as much as you

225
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,918
can for us it was huge making that

226
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,000
decision

227
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,560
because

228
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,879
it's a totally different system and if

229
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,759
you screw it up

230
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,000
it can be costly so

231
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,319
we went with raised beds

232
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,120
and you know if somebody were growing in

233
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,520
pots and using bottle nutrients

234
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,478
they could go to uh something that fits

235
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,639
their

236
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,240
tent which uh you know i think a four by

237
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,519
four you got a four by four or three by

238
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,680
three bed

239
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,759
and then the same goes for four by eight

240
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,759
or you know anything bigger

241
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,838
but um

242
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,519
you know

243
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,600
i uh

244
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,278
after lots and lots of research we

245
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,839
decided to

246
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,519
to use basically the same base mix that

247
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,680
everyone else uses

248
00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:01,039
which is 33 percent compost 33 percent

249
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:03,199
peat or cocoa or you know your

250
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,799
desired media

251
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,519
and then 33

252
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,039
aeration or a third of each or however

253
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,080
you want to say that

254
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:11,759
um

255
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,639
but

256
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,919
uh you know at home or commercially

257
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,559
commercially it's gonna be quite a bit

258
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,759
more complicated but uh

259
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,239
in a tent

260
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,519
at home

261
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,278
[Music]

262
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,159
someone could

263
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:28,958
either find a local soil yard

264
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:32,559
that's already mixing something real

265
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,439
similar to that and a minute themselves

266
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,518
or

267
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,080
you could go with a great company like

268
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,639
build a soil and

269
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,879
buy something that you know

270
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:46,639
products that already have integrity and

271
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,639
and are already mixed

272
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,560
we mixed everything at home

273
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:55,120
and went and bought

274
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:59,439
pete from lowe's

275
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,720
which was canadian sphagnum peat moss

276
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,600
we like

277
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,519
rice holes and pumice for

278
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,759
aeration

279
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,440
but you can use

280
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:13,200
uh other types of aeration volcanic rock

281
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,959
and

282
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,040
you know people use perlite we've

283
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,599
actually got some soil that has perlite

284
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,799
in it um

285
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,240
but

286
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,879
you know and you can source your own

287
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,879
compost uh that one's tricky as you

288
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,480
probably know

289
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,559
um

290
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,240
you know that's that's really where

291
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,719
you're probably either going to be

292
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,839
making or break it i would say is

293
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,560
finding good compost so

294
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:44,320
we did that at home and uh are even

295
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,319
doing some composting here at home

296
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,839
and we're trying to do a biocomplete

297
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,278
compost

298
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,560
which is what i would suggest for

299
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:56,078
anybody that's really more like your

300
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:58,799
soil food web and elaine ingham

301
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:58,799
school of thought

302
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,360
but uh

303
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,799
amending your soil is going to be a

304
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,560
little different if you're if you're

305
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,120
commercial

306
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,319
i don't suggest using certain products

307
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,000
um

308
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,160
kilt meal

309
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,159
anything really from the ocean is going

310
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,159
to be

311
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,559
salty and possibly

312
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:23,838
contaminated with

313
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:25,679
things in the medicinal plant market

314
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,760
that are going to cause

315
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,439
you know health risks and issues like

316
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,958
that

317
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,279
heavy metals

318
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,278
you know

319
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:37,278
but uh

320
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,919
there's also

321
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,519
some easier ways to dial things in and

322
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,278
for us since we were commercial we

323
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,799
tested our soil

324
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,399
uh

325
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,319
we were really doing that under the

326
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,839
guidance of brandon ross

327
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,920
and uh

328
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,120
doing it consistently

329
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:57,919
uh you know once a month at least

330
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,399
if you've got rows

331
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:02,078
uh and you're using raised beds

332
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,679
um

333
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:04,638
you know that that gets a little bit

334
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,919
tricky

335
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,159
because

336
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,519
uh each individual bed is going to be a

337
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,838
little bit different and if you're

338
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,879
growing different cultivars that's going

339
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,880
to change things up a little bit as well

340
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,399
different plants pull different things

341
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,399
from the soil

342
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,440
so

343
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,639
um

344
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,279
but really

345
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,159
there's some great uh information out

346
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:30,240
there already uh coot's mix and that

347
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,559
recipes uh

348
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,799
already out there

349
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,559
for people to easily

350
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,719
access

351
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,559
i think you can even get you know a lot

352
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,000
of build-a-souls recipes and what

353
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,078
they're using

354
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,919
uh just off their back

355
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:46,638
uh you know but

356
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,159
we

357
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,159
prefer

358
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:56,000
soybean meal uh alfalfa meal

359
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:57,838
and try to avoid things from the ocean

360
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,879
not just because of heavy metals and

361
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,839
other contaminants but because of sodium

362
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:06,000
and

363
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:08,480
you know salt buildup so

364
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,799
once they get that mixed

365
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,800
um

366
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,759
you know if they're not gonna test their

367
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,239
soil

368
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:21,200
uh i would inoculate

369
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,519
plant and take off uh because it's gonna

370
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,519
do pretty awesome and it's gonna do a

371
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,360
lot of the work for you and it's gonna

372
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,440
get better with time

373
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,879
uh we like using cover crop and other

374
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,880
things like that to help with

375
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,160
you know the uh the the full cycle there

376
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,199
that's happening in the soil food web uh

377
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:46,078
things breaking down we do use worms

378
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,359
uh worm castings even but once you get

379
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,278
the worms in the bed you really don't

380
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,278
need the castings a whole lot anymore

381
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,879
they're doing a lot of that for you

382
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:54,480
uh so

383
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,519
um

384
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,120
i can keep going you want me to

385
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,039
i i did a follow-up question i should

386
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,480
ask this in the during the intro but on

387
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,240
your farm

388
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,039
what's the you said you're in raised

389
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,560
beds how many like what size raid beds

390
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,719
are using how many plants are you

391
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:14,838
growing things like that

392
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,839
so we have three flower rooms indoor

393
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:21,519
um we have a veg and mother and

394
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,839
propagation area um and then we have a

395
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,000
greenhouse that we just built

396
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,600
um

397
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,240
you can uh you can find a lot of that on

398
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,240
instagram at red dirt raised okay

399
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:41,359
we just uh just gotten that finished and

400
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,198
really 2022 is gonna be where we're

401
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,360
getting to display

402
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,278
uh the spaceship we built out there

403
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,759
because it's honestly

404
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:53,919
better than our indoor operation

405
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:56,399
and more sustainable

406
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:59,039
uh more regenerative you know we're

407
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,039
gonna be using the sun we'll also be

408
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,679
doing some no-till

409
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:05,679
out there i think eventually

410
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:08,559
we uh we've

411
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,319
taken and had a lot of people bless us

412
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:14,078
with advice and information over the

413
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,278
last few years uh like brandon

414
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,000
um

415
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:20,480
but we'll also be doing some ferments

416
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,799
and do ferments indoors

417
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,039
um just in

418
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,719
not in not in uh

419
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,039
high amounts

420
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,920
we really try to let the soil food web

421
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,278
do as much of the work as we can

422
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,319
and then

423
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,360
um

424
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,680
you know brandon is mainly a

425
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,480
water-soluble

426
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:45,758
guy and a lot of his information and

427
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,159
recommendations have been

428
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,278
with water soluble so that's a really

429
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,879
easy way to get balance in your soil and

430
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,838
after testing

431
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,198
um you know on a commercial level where

432
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,519
you're trying to keep production

433
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:02,319
consistent that was

434
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,519
a big deal for us we uh having that in

435
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,278
your in your toolbox is huge you know we

436
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,360
will get deeper into water soluble

437
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,120
mineral inputs and a little bit here so

438
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,480
okay so you're in beds

439
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,360
and you just kind of started with your

440
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:20,000
own soil mix versus trying to revive

441
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,079
the native soil in in the ground now my

442
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,559
question for you before we move on is

443
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,799
can home growers reuse the soil where

444
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,679
synthetic nutrients have been used in

445
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,278
or

446
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,120
or do you think they should just start

447
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:34,480
fresh with making their own soil like

448
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,679
you mentioned with the 33 33 33 mix

449
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,278
i would definitely say start fresh

450
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:44,000
uh with that 33 33 33 um

451
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:47,360
that's not to say it can't be done

452
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,958
uh but that's not the way we did it

453
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,560
and um

454
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,198
you know i i would assume that if

455
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,758
someone had a pretty good base mix

456
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:57,439
and had used some synthetic nutrients

457
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,360
and at a time or two

458
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,959
they could probably still turn that into

459
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,120
a living soil

460
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,438
uh environment over

461
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,919
a short period of time

462
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,919
the microbes will remediate quickly

463
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,280
they'll remediate just about anything

464
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,480
quickly

465
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:13,759
or

466
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,959
revive

467
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,959
you know um

468
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,318
allowing them to do

469
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:24,399
most of the work has really been key i

470
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,000
think for you know especially no-till

471
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,439
farmers but

472
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,720
um

473
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,960
for us as well uh trying less is more

474
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,160
kind of attitude you know

475
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,919
um

476
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,960
really allowing

477
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:43,120
uh the plant and the soil to have that

478
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,120
symbiotic relationship and

479
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,798
stay out of their way as much as

480
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,240
possible

481
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,119
that makes sense

482
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,359
so for the

483
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:55,599
33-33-33 mix i just released an episode

484
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,759
recently with jeremy silver from build a

485
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:00,240
soil not sure if he caught that one or

486
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,038
not but he gets real into detail about

487
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,200
33 33 33 and what to use when you're

488
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:07,599
soil building so we won't get too deep

489
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,240
into that in this episode but i do want

490
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:13,359
to know what initial amendments you're

491
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,200
putting within that mix

492
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,918
so um

493
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,679
initially we'll start with a really good

494
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,240
compost which is going to have more

495
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,960
nutrients in it than just about anything

496
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,960
uh else you're going to put in there

497
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,360
already broken down and ready to go

498
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,558
available

499
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,159
but uh

500
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:38,558
we'll also add alfalfa meal

501
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:41,038
we might use a little bit of green sand

502
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,119
we might uh

503
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,400
use a little soybean meal

504
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,279
um

505
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,240
we do have some oyster shell meal in our

506
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,399
soil

507
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,720
uh but not a lot

508
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,480
um

509
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:59,600
we use some gypsum um

510
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,599
calcium sulfate

511
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,319
there's a little cow phos in our soil

512
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:11,839
worm castings you know which are going

513
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,840
to be a great source of nitrogen

514
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,240
and then we fired it up

515
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,400
oh about three weeks after actually

516
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,400
getting soil in beds

517
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,720
uh with worms

518
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,960
a little bit of cover crop and really

519
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,679
kind of let everything go for

520
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,960
you know 20-21 days on its own before

521
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,840
planting

522
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,679
okay and then eventually those nutrients

523
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,678
you know majority of them will deplete

524
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,600
and then you have to re-amend like a lot

525
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,880
of folks when growing indoors they'll

526
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:42,639
have that initial amendment and then

527
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,240
they'll do a top dressing you know

528
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,679
roughly 30 days

529
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,359
into the grow

530
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,360
typically you know folks will do it

531
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:51,839
before flipping the flower they will do

532
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,759
it 20 to 30 30 days into flower so this

533
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,159
is the general way of going about

534
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,000
feeding you know we're talking indoors

535
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,160
after you do those initial amendments

536
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,919
that you mentioned the initial planting

537
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,640
you said you wait 20 days and you plant

538
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,880
in at what point do you do any other

539
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,720
fertilizer add in any more you know top

540
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,039
dressing or what

541
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,120
i think midway through flour is a pretty

542
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,319
good point um

543
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,639
you know if

544
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,480
if you've tested your soil and you know

545
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,600
the balance and the nutrition levels are

546
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,519
there

547
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,519
then you may be able to do a run with

548
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,558
water only and

549
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,918
you know that's kind of the goal um

550
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,879
but

551
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:33,520
we like malted barley

552
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,520
we use

553
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,440
we use regular water and only do that a

554
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:41,759
couple of times a week in those beds uh

555
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,200
but occasionally there will be a feeding

556
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,798
there will be a little bit extra in

557
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,840
there

558
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:49,839
and

559
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:54,000
you know some people will just top dress

560
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:56,720
if we can uh we like to water in as much

561
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,159
uh food as we can as much nutrition as

562
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,480
we can as much

563
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,480
inoculation as we can

564
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,000
the water really helps

565
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,640
uh

566
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,880
spread things out you know

567
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,600
absolutely now circling back to the

568
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,280
water soluble mineral inputs what water

569
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,480
soluble mineral inputs do you use

570
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,158
so we're

571
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,720
pretty big on

572
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:25,360
uh soybean amino acids

573
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:28,079
uh hydrolysate soybean hydrolysate um

574
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:32,240
you get a high quality uh version of

575
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:35,678
that and it's pretty water soluble

576
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,640
and they make a form of calcium sulfate

577
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,919
uh

578
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,360
gypsum

579
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:44,320
uh that is really fine and powdery and

580
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:46,639
is fairly water soluble

581
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,399
a lot of people are familiar with

582
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,840
epsom salt

583
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,840
magnesium sulfate

584
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,798
we use it

585
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:59,439
and

586
00:21:54,798 --> 00:22:01,599
it you know extremely water soluble

587
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,360
potassium sulfate

588
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:06,000
uh you gotta watch what you buy because

589
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:08,558
there are chemical versions of these and

590
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,599
then there are mine mineral versions of

591
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:13,200
these

592
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,480
and i suggest uh like down to earth

593
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,400
uh

594
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,200
products that you know have been mined

595
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,720
and

596
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,640
uh aren't

597
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,159
some byproduct of

598
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,600
you know industry

599
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,080
but uh

600
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:29,839
for the most part uh that is it we do

601
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:33,678
use humic acid uh in powder form

602
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,879
and um we also use a humic fulvic full

603
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,000
power

604
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,480
but that's really i'd say the majority

605
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,558
of the water solubles that we use

606
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,599
so you mentioned a ton there when do you

607
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:46,399
generally

608
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,759
apply those water soluble mineral inputs

609
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,840
i'm sure there's different times for

610
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,440
different different ones right

611
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,240
sure um

612
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,960
cool thing about those is you can top

613
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,440
dress them and literally get

614
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,000
like a full run you know seven eight

615
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,400
weeks before you really start seeing

616
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,240
uh levels depleting

617
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,120
or you can

618
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,919
do

619
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,879
small feedings with them and water them

620
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,038
in

621
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,640
uh you know once a week

622
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:16,640
um

623
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,799
the soybean amino

624
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,640
the humic acid is something that you can

625
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:24,158
use uh almost all the way through

626
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,600
and i mean

627
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,679
vegetative stage on into flowering

628
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,439
uh you could cut back on the soybean

629
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,640
aminos because of the high nitrogen

630
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,038
content

631
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:39,600
i would say probably week five

632
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,599
um week 4 a flower

633
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,679
especially if you're running a system

634
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,120
like ours where you have other sources

635
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,798
of nitrogen

636
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,239
in the soil already

637
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,200
but

638
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,919
the others uh you know calcium sulfate

639
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,600
gypsum uh

640
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,278
obviously uh all plants uh

641
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,319
like calcium

642
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:02,558
um

643
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:06,079
some more than others medicinal plants

644
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:07,839
or hogs and

645
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,599
they're gonna they're gonna want calcium

646
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,759
source strong source of calcium and

647
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:15,199
magnesium all the way through

648
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:16,960
uh growth really uh vegetative and cloud

649
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,798
but uh

650
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,880
potassium sulfate you're going to use

651
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:22,480
that quite a bit more in the later

652
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,320
stages

653
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,278
i would say

654
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,798
uh in lighter amounts um

655
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:32,960
and your

656
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:34,879
first three four weeks of flower

657
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,720
and then that's gonna get a little

658
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,559
stronger in

659
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,919
probably weeks four through eight four

660
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,240
through ten

661
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,480
i know there's some that you mentioned

662
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,640
that people often use as foliar feeds

663
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,880
you know they want that fast acting

664
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,000
perfect example would be if you have

665
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,559
you're starting to see magnesium

666
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,759
deficiency they'll do a full layer of

667
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,158
epsom salt

668
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,400
magnesium sulfate do you do any foliars

669
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,440
at all for those water-soluble mineral

670
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,960
inputs

671
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,640
we do

672
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,919
we like to use

673
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,960
the magnesium sulfate

674
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:13,960
we like to use

675
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,960
a bioavailable version of silica

676
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:20,720
we uh we also pull your feed some ohn

677
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,159
and

678
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,360
um

679
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,640
a lot of our ipm is foliar

680
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,399
um

681
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,320
about to get off track there i know we

682
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,600
can get into that later but

683
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:36,240
let's see if i'm leaving anything out uh

684
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:38,719
even microbial uh

685
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,880
foliars you know we we have a couple of

686
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,839
different products one made right here

687
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,799
in oklahoma called wind river

688
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:47,759
and uh it's great in soil and as a full

689
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,079
year

690
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:50,079
um

691
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:56,079
see if i'm leaving anything out

692
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,720
i think that's really about it a few uh

693
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:00,639
stimulants

694
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,880
you know there's a couple different oils

695
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,360
that we use

696
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,039
that will stimulate uh the plant's

697
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,038
immune system if you will

698
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,759
and i think that's about it for four

699
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:16,639
years how often do you inoculate

700
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:19,038
microbes once a week at least we're

701
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,759
doing something uh you know we've got a

702
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,278
couple of different inoculations that we

703
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,839
like to use

704
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:28,159
some are more uh

705
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:31,119
well most of i'll be honest or more

706
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,120
fungally dominant

707
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:37,120
but we do have a couple of different

708
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,640
products even that we like

709
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,558
we've used

710
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,960
you know everything under the sun fish

711
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,319
[ __ ] um

712
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,240
mammoth p

713
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:49,200
uh but honestly

714
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,640
there's nothing like really good compost

715
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,720
and uh

716
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,919
you know you can do a lot of people

717
00:26:52,720 --> 00:27:00,000
don't like to do teas indoor especially

718
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,840
um because of the risk you may take uh

719
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,640
brewing

720
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:04,558
uh

721
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,080
bad bacteria

722
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:10,079
so uh you know a top dress of compost

723
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:12,798
especially if you're using a good mulch

724
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,399
layer will go a long way you can water

725
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,759
that in

726
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,320
or

727
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,319
you can do

728
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:24,558
a concentrate you're basically straining

729
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:28,239
uh the compost

730
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:30,960
into the water and um

731
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,960
and creating a concentrated version

732
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,720
there and then using that to water in

733
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,919
instead of uh

734
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,640
brewing you know

735
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,320
and i'm i'm drawing a blank uh your soul

736
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,200
food web folks

737
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,839
uh are probably bigger your elaning and

738
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,880
folks are probably bigger on these

739
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:50,319
terminologies uh

740
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,919
and know them well

741
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,519
but uh

742
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,679
that's that may be a little safer

743
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,319
version and we often do that but we also

744
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:02,559
do teas and um

745
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,759
you know we use some uh species of

746
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,000
fungi

747
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:09,359
as

748
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,278
food cycling nutrient cycling

749
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,199
and you know

750
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,240
they're a benefit to the plant's health

751
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,200
and then

752
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:21,440
some are going to be more for ipm and

753
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,000
you know to keep pest pressure down

754
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,120
uh other bacteria

755
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,079
fungi and pests i'm glad you brought up

756
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,479
the the risk of brewing a tea which is

757
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:34,319
that you're brewing anaerobic bag

758
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,079
bacteria right which that's happened to

759
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:37,759
me before you know not having enough air

760
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:39,119
stones in the bucket and then giving it

761
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,038
to my plant and all of a sudden the

762
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,119
plant looks like crap for like several

763
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,398
days and it's like

764
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,359
you know eventually it bounced back but

765
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,798
it was a significant step back you know

766
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:50,319
so it can absolutely happen you know

767
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,319
making sure you have enough air stones

768
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:55,278
in there is important

769
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:57,678
some people actually put a airline going

770
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:58,798
directly into their bag of compost that

771
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,480
they put

772
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:01,679
into the bucket i don't know if you do

773
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,519
that as well or anything like that if

774
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,759
you've heard about that tip but i

775
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,319
thought that was pretty interesting

776
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,599
we haven't tried that um

777
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:12,879
so

778
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:15,519
uh we have a brewer that we built with

779
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,200
the help of leighton morrison um not

780
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,519
sure if you're familiar with him from

781
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,519
future cannabis project they do living

782
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,079
spoiled conversations

783
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:28,000
but leighton helped us uh build a brewer

784
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:29,519
here that we love it's a 55 gallon

785
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,038
tap coat tank

786
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,599
tone bottom

787
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:34,558
and then it's plumbed

788
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:36,319
and

789
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:39,759
has a really cool

790
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:41,359
uh air pump going to it that's

791
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:43,278
quiet and

792
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:45,038
low maintenance

793
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,278
but with that air entering the bottom

794
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:48,240
instead of using a stone it eliminates

795
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:52,880
the

796
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,880
need to clean a stone or you know

797
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,120
buy new ones you know you gotta you

798
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,439
gotta replace those things

799
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:01,038
after a while just from gunk

800
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,600
but um

801
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:06,000
now we've loved that brewer and

802
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,119
you know we'll use it even just a mix of

803
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,200
feeding

804
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,798
just to aerate our water not necessarily

805
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,679
to brew a tea

806
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,720
but just to have good aerated living

807
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,000
water

808
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,880
and

809
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,880
moving water

810
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,840
but

811
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,159
yeah

812
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:27,439
we that eliminated a lot of the

813
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:30,880
the bad issues with brewing for us and

814
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,120
then you know a few different things uh

815
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,240
about brewing

816
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,199
uh

817
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,679
you know our tips that we've been given

818
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,480
are um

819
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:45,840
you know strain your compost instead of

820
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,558
brew it that can often be uh

821
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,879
very helpful and you can

822
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:54,079
make that concentrated version of that

823
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,080
inoculant that away

824
00:30:55,359 --> 00:31:00,398
and then water that in

825
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:02,558
but if you're seeing any brown uh around

826
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:06,319
the ring or the top of

827
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:08,079
your brew uh and you are brewing a tea

828
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:10,639
the stuff that starts sticking to the

829
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:13,439
side of your bucket

830
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,480
uh or your tank

831
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:20,159
that's usually uh

832
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,399
i believe kind of a bad sign of

833
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,960
that bad bacteria brewing that

834
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:27,278
anaerobic bacteria growing or maybe i

835
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,840
was told that it was waste of some sort

836
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:31,200
from uh you know the microbes

837
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,599
but um

838
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,840
anyways we tried to limit the times we

839
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:38,480
you know when we started out it was

840
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:39,839
sometimes 24-48 hours

841
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,558
of brewing

842
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,000
and then uh that eventually

843
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:45,599
got to where it wasn't really any more

844
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,398
than about 12.

845
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,278
and

846
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:51,199
by that time we're watering it in

847
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:52,079
and usually don't see any of that brown

848
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,399
film

849
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:57,678
stuck to the side

850
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:59,759
at that point so

851
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,759
i think that that avoids a lot of that

852
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,839
anaerobic activity

853
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:07,119
you know people run into you do like a

854
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:09,278
48 hour brew and you got a stinky

855
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:10,959
smelly uh

856
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:13,480
you know and that doesn't always happen

857
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,759
i think if you have enough sugar

858
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,640
carbohydrates in there for those

859
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:21,038
microbes to feast on and they don't die

860
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,759
off and they probably thrive for

861
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:26,319
you know not real sure how long but

862
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:27,919
yeah i typically do no longer than 24

863
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,519
hours sometimes i'll pull a little bit

864
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,440
earlier than that just to kind of safe

865
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,120
side things but i don't really do teas

866
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,600
that often i mean like you mentioned in

867
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:38,319
the beginning something you can just top

868
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:40,000
dress compost and water that in right

869
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:41,439
that's very effective as well so i'm

870
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,359
glad you mentioned that let's flip it up

871
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,640
let's talk about ferments i want to get

872
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:46,398
into this this is something that i

873
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,559
haven't done myself but i hear more and

874
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:51,119
more people talking about it so can you

875
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:53,200
talk to us about ferments what are they

876
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,199
how you go about doing them

877
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,038
you bet um

878
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:02,159
so we're in no in no way are we um

879
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:03,359
experts in ferments but

880
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,600
uh

881
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:06,558
van from k f garden

882
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,038
um

883
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:12,639
i met him at a convention here in

884
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:14,798
oklahoma in 2020 i believe

885
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,679
and uh

886
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:20,000
ended up using some of his techniques uh

887
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,559
we started off uh

888
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,038
with kind of his baseline in veg which

889
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:27,038
was humic and aminos

890
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:28,720
which is a great combination by the way

891
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,000
i'm not saying that's all plants need

892
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,200
but

893
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,278
we've seen good results from it

894
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,278
the the ferments that we used were his

895
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,278
versions

896
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:41,119
uh k f

897
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:44,079
and um

898
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:46,000
you know i think he's doing things uh a

899
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,879
little differently kind of a hybrid

900
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,359
version if you will

901
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,039
for him you know he lived in la i

902
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,398
believe and

903
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:58,000
didn't didn't really have a farm to

904
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:58,959
do knf

905
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,798
on

906
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,038
korean natural farming

907
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:03,038
and

908
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:08,000
i think simplifying it

909
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:12,559
was was probably what he was going for

910
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,559
but anyways you know fermentation

911
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,440
taking

912
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,679
fruit and vegetables

913
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,358
with sugar and allowing

914
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,240
or without i think a lot of people

915
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:26,799
actually do it without and

916
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:29,118
allow that stuff to break down

917
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,119
and

918
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:34,320
you know same process used for making

919
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:34,320
alcohol

920
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,078
but

921
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,279
all those nutrients become available

922
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,720
again

923
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,040
and

924
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:45,199
at some point you can stabilize it with

925
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,960
his recipe we were only going a couple

926
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,118
weeks

927
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,800
and using lots of different kinds of

928
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,399
fruits and veggies

929
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,280
um

930
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:58,880
and uh you know you try to

931
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:01,040
be responsible uh uh go get organically

932
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,119
grown fruits and vegetables and start

933
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:04,800
there if you're going to do it that way

934
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,838
but i think the whole premise behind

935
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,320
korean natural farming is probably

936
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:11,838
using the land you have you know to grow

937
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,680
those fruits and vegetables and then

938
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,320
fermenting them and

939
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:18,319
you know using that to feed some plants

940
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,000
feeding plants you know and you're kind

941
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,519
of speeding up that process with

942
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,519
fermentation

943
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:26,000
um

944
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:28,159
van's idea behind a lot of it

945
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,440
is

946
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,960
even

947
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,400
i think trying to push certain

948
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,000
cannabinoids and terpene levels uh and

949
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,519
using certain

950
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,039
fruits and vegetables uh to target those

951
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:44,480
um

952
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:48,000
so we started using this bloom ferment

953
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,000
and have now for

954
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:53,279
i would say five six months

955
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:55,358
with success

956
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,119
that's in a living soil system and

957
00:35:55,358 --> 00:36:00,078
raised beds

958
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,519
and it's not only using ferments uh so

959
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,800
we're definitely a lot of the times

960
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:05,280
using less

961
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,359
than the suggested amount

962
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,040
and sometimes if we feel like they

963
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:10,000
really need something we may give them

964
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:11,199
more

965
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,400
but

966
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:16,159
um combining that with that

967
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,039
soul food web

968
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:20,078
i've seen nothing but amazing results

969
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:21,920
from

970
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,599
and you know i know there's a lot of

971
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,838
controversy there

972
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,039
uh

973
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:30,799
but i mean all in all it's uh

974
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:32,880
we're we're still doing the same thing

975
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:36,240
and we have the same goal

976
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,358
so for us it's always been about quality

977
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:41,159
you know

978
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:41,159
uh not necessarily

979
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,880
you know there's almost belief systems

980
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:48,480
built behind these methods

981
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,280
and if you veer

982
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,240
one from another

983
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,599
the community doesn't necessarily always

984
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:59,439
agree on stuff like that so

985
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,519
but for us it's always been about

986
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,639
providing the best possible medicine we

987
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,199
can

988
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:07,199
um and so if that's combining some of

989
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:09,838
these methods together

990
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:11,439
that's fine with us

991
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:14,239
do you have like a general recipe that

992
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,119
somebody can follow or like a source

993
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:20,319
that a noob like me can go to

994
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:23,680
and learn how to start fermenting

995
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,200
you bet uh go follow

996
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:27,118
uh

997
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:28,639
knf garden

998
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,880
um

999
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:33,838
go follow

1000
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,480
uh you know uh jeremy has some great

1001
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:37,759
ferment uh products that i've seen

1002
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,000
available

1003
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,000
so that's another good source

1004
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,119
you know don't come to us for that

1005
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:48,719
information necessarily i can give you

1006
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,960
uh you know the

1007
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:52,559
recipe that we use but

1008
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,199
we're not uh

1009
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:58,078
knf gurus by any means

1010
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:59,118
uh you know the the man himself chris

1011
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,480
trump

1012
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:05,240
um

1013
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,240
i believe that chris trump on instagram

1014
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,799
lots of good ferment farmers out there

1015
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,520
lots of good guys still in

1016
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,880
cali uh humble region

1017
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:25,358
using ferments uh

1018
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,838
man i wish i could uh

1019
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,838
i wish i could name them all off

1020
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,679
on the spot

1021
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:34,239
uh but that right there ought to get you

1022
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,358
started and van's method is so super

1023
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:37,199
simple

1024
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:38,400
um

1025
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:41,039
you know

1026
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,240
you can't go wrong there uh i think he's

1027
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:47,358
even selling uh his bloom ferment

1028
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,799
uh so you can go buy that and just start

1029
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:51,279
there and see

1030
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,960
you know the difference but

1031
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,040
uh

1032
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,480
you know he uh uh

1033
00:38:55,039 --> 00:39:01,039
claims you're gonna see a greasier um

1034
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,719
terpier flower and we have seen some

1035
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,400
great results

1036
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:07,199
uh from

1037
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,519
our experience with that so

1038
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:10,639
i think uh i think you can't go wrong

1039
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:13,119
with

1040
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:16,159
with his stuff j plant speaker i think

1041
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:19,599
is another guy that may do some

1042
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:21,199
hell i think masonic does some k s stuff

1043
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,800
uh

1044
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:26,399
you know lots of good teachers out there

1045
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,920
yeah lots of sources there i'm familiar

1046
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,440
with some of those names and not but not

1047
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,200
all of them so i'll definitely be

1048
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,039
following some of those names for sure i

1049
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:34,960
do want to get into cover crops a little

1050
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:36,960
bit so we're talking about making that

1051
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,599
transition from synthetic to organic

1052
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,960
cover crops is something that's optional

1053
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,039
but a lot of people use it because there

1054
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,480
are benefits to it right so for example

1055
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:48,960
i use clover for a cover crop a white

1056
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,400
dutch clover is the kind that i use

1057
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,240
and one thing i've learned is that it

1058
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,400
helps with nitrogen fixation so it's

1059
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:56,078
actually taking nitrogen from the air

1060
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,920
converting it and putting it to the soil

1061
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,240
that's in a form that the plant can

1062
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,559
uptake right so that's just one benefit

1063
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,078
on one particular type of cover crop

1064
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:07,119
there's a whole different types of cover

1065
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,880
crops out there with various amounts of

1066
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,960
various types of benefits for sure what

1067
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,480
do you use for cover crops and kind

1068
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,599
what's your process for planting them as

1069
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,760
well

1070
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,800
we're big on clover as well

1071
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,560
and

1072
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,960
native grasses are great you know

1073
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:25,279
you just got to be careful

1074
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,039
what seed you're starting with

1075
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,280
uh because you never know how enough

1076
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:31,759
that was grown or harvested

1077
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,079
uh so you know build the soil

1078
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,119
uh here in oklahoma we've got red bud

1079
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,039
soil company and they make some great

1080
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,079
cover crop blends

1081
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,279
um

1082
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,760
you know we also uh like planting stuff

1083
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,079
like carrots and radishes and things

1084
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,680
that are going to penetrate the soil

1085
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:54,240
and feed everything in the soil or below

1086
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:54,239
the soil

1087
00:40:54,559 --> 00:41:00,000
but uh a process

1088
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:01,759
for planting cover crop

1089
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,599
for us

1090
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,280
uh we started with cover crop after

1091
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,760
initially filling our beds and

1092
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,760
everything

1093
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,960
and then

1094
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:18,559
we'll replant cover crop

1095
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,599
after harvest when we've got access to

1096
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,480
the soil again

1097
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,000
and

1098
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,079
really that's about it uh

1099
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,159
that that

1100
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,318
really takes care of itself

1101
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:33,519
uh really well you're letting nature do

1102
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:35,119
its thing

1103
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:36,480
and

1104
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,559
um

1105
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,519
not too complicated

1106
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:43,519
there you know so between grows when

1107
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:45,440
you're planting that cover crop

1108
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:47,920
how long are you letting that cover crop

1109
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,200
grow and you know you're cutting it down

1110
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,119
and letting it die off is there like a

1111
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:53,759
period of time you know like two weeks

1112
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,880
or a month or what's your time period

1113
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,200
so uh we'll we'll plant and basically

1114
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,079
let the cover crop grow

1115
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:04,799
until it's um

1116
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,480
maybe becoming annoying you know getting

1117
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,200
a little bit out of hand

1118
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,039
uh we may chop it back then

1119
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:13,919
but a lot of the times we'll let that

1120
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:17,679
naturally uh occur as well

1121
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,760
and and i haven't had to do a ton of

1122
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:21,679
uh maintenance now we don't use near as

1123
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,800
much cover crop as a lot of people i've

1124
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:24,559
seen

1125
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,200
um

1126
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:30,239
cantwell over greenlight productions has

1127
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:32,719
usually got a pretty nice green bed

1128
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,799
going it looks like and

1129
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:38,959
we don't use quite that much i think he

1130
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:41,280
uses dichondra and some other things

1131
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,039
that we haven't tried yet but are very

1132
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,960
interested in

1133
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:49,838
um but yeah i would say uh

1134
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,880
you know experiment with stuff like uh

1135
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:55,440
carrots and and radishes and growing

1136
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:59,760
even you know companion plants

1137
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,519
uh with your medicinal plants uh or your

1138
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,640
vegetable garden

1139
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:05,039
um

1140
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:07,440
now you'd be amazed uh

1141
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:10,000
the difference in a bed full of plants

1142
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,880
and a pot with one

1143
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,159
and what you see going on there

1144
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,000
uh they definitely enjoy one another

1145
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:19,440
i think so too i've seen it

1146
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,920
for sure

1147
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,000
yeah so there are a lot of people trying

1148
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,240
to make that transition from synthetic

1149
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,679
to organic right taking a step back

1150
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:29,838
generally speaking

1151
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,759
what advice do you have for those

1152
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:33,838
trying to make that transition

1153
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,119
i would say be patient

1154
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:36,000
uh

1155
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,240
you know

1156
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,920
everything may not play out just like

1157
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:43,519
you want

1158
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,519
especially that first run or two

1159
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,400
you know if you're doing a no-till type

1160
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:48,400
of method

1161
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:55,159
that less is better mindset will go a

1162
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:55,159
long way

1163
00:43:55,358 --> 00:44:01,119
and uh don't water so much

1164
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:02,880
you know that's probably

1165
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,880
one of the most common mistakes that

1166
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,318
people make

1167
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,720
going from

1168
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:11,358
synthetics to organics

1169
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:13,838
uh if you're using

1170
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:15,920
a decent sized pot which i've heard

1171
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:17,119
jeremy and others talk quite a bit about

1172
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,079
uh

1173
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,480
you know

1174
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:23,599
there's gonna be enough moisture and

1175
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,000
nutrition in that pot

1176
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,760
to last that plant beyond you know what

1177
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
we normally would think

1178
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,359
and uh

1179
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,760
yeah you know just be patient and

1180
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:37,119
spend as much time reading and and

1181
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,280
searching for

1182
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:42,640
information as you can

1183
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,480
uh an ounce of prevention is worth a

1184
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:45,279
pound of cure

1185
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,119
so

1186
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,440
you know in an organic system where

1187
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,800
things are a little bit more permanent

1188
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,599
uh

1189
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,200
the more research you do up front and

1190
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,359
the and the

1191
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:58,799
more prepared you are going into that

1192
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:01,279
situation
