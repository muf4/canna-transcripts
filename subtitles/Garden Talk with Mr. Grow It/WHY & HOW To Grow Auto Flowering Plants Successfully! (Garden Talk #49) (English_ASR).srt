1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,560
coming up on garden talk i myself have

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,400
never

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:10,000
had increased yield from topping in auto

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,440
and these days i'm really trying to

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,679
focus more

6
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,919
on feeding the soil rather than feeding

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,760
the plant a lot of this stuff is just

8
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:20,160
kind of subjective as again what you're

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,000
doing what your goals are what your grow

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,760
area looks like they're great for

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,359
concentrates as well a lot of people are

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,519
actually growing them because of the

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,439
fact that they grow so fast they're able

14
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,198
to turn them around and press them and

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,920
create concentrates right from the

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,679
flowers if you're in a really small area

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,079
and you've got a ceiling

18
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,479
max height then you might consider

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,719
smaller pots you definitely in my

20
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,640
opinion want to transplant them well

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,960
before the stretch everything that's

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,799
alive has a will to survive you know

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,039
even microbial life everything wants to

24
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,038

autos i mean it's just about every day

103
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,199

so forth so we're going to get into so

110
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,759
much stuff in regards to autos today but

111
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,280
first one of the things i like to do

112
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,598
with every guest would be an

113
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,959
introduction so can you tell us a little

114
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,199
bit about yourself and kind of how you

115
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,640
got into gardening yeah man first i just

116
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,959
want to say thank you for having me on

117
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,079
i'm really honored and i appreciate it

118
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,238
um

119
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,639
i got really passionate about gardening

120
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,638
probably about five years ago uh before

121
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,000
that um i've been around like my

122
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,560
grandparents who gardened a lot um

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,319
vegetable gardens a lot of irises and

124
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,319
and just different plants and trees

125
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,680
around their property

126
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,319
kind of grew up a little around that and

127
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,400
that's kind of my exposure to it and but

128
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:44,079
i wasn't really interested until about

129
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:46,478
five years ago and it's when i realized

130
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:49,198
um how much you know certain medicinal

131
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,560
plants could help my tourette syndrome

132
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,680
so um

133
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,918
my online name often is tourette grower

134
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,240
and that's because i have tourette

135
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,918
syndrome my 14 year old son also has

136
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,960
it's a genetic thing that runs in

137
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,000
families

138
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:07,198
and it started when i was a a young lad

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,720
probably nine or ten and uh

140
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,879
would just kind of do weird stuff with

141
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,720
my eyes and things like that and it

142
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,199
wasn't until my early 20s that i was

143
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,720
actually kind of diagnosed with it

144
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,840
so there's other things that come along

145
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,680
with that

146
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,560
anxiety

147
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,600
ocd are very popular things that go

148
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,319
along with tourette syndrome so

149
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,199
yeah when i discovered how well

150
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,599
medicinal plants could help me

151
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,680
and you know of course along the way

152
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,680
just other things about different plants

153
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:43,600
that that we like um i began

154
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,840
uh using those those plants and um

155
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,080
quickly realized that uh it's pretty

156
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,159
expensive to source those plants from

157
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,240
other areas and so

158
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,320
i thought well i'm just going to start

159
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,000
growing my own i had a little bit of

160
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,959
garden experience just being around my

161
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
grandparents and stuff so

162
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:05,519
i started growing autos somebody handed

163
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,918
me a handful of auto seeds

164
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,839
someone local to me and so i just began

165
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,198
popping those and germinating them and

166
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,719
learning and

167
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,400
growing and researching and

168
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,720
you know as i said it's one of the

169
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,799
co-morbids of tourette's is ocd so i can

170
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,199
become pretty obsessive compulsive about

171
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,520
things and i think gardening was one of

172
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,639
them but more in a positive way you know

173
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,719
and

174
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,840
yeah i just started searching around

175
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,479
actually and i i love podcasts including

176
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,959
yours and so i was searching around for

177
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:39,439
podcasts revolved more around autos and

178
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,799
more around the home grower and not

179
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,240
necessarily

180
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,639
commercial grows

181
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,439
and there wasn't one so uh man i just

182
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,840
decided to start my own and that was

183
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,680
back i think in 2019

184
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,638
or 2018

185
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,639
and uh that's how that came about

186
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,478
and since then for the last five years

187
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,079
i've just really been

188
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:04,719
uh plugging away just learning and uh

189
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:07,519
and gardening and

190
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,599
just being a part of the community that

191
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,359
exists you know and just um jumping in

192
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:14,000
there and letting that iron

193
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,680
iron sharpen iron as they say you know

194
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,879
growers coming together like you and i

195
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,280
are right now and just talking and uh

196
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:24,319
taking truth nuggets and learning and uh

197
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:26,079
it's a great community so um

198
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,840

so thanks for coming on man i appreciate

219
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,879
it that's so cool to hear so let's start

220
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,959
with your style of gardening i know you

221
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,479
primarily grow autos i think you only

222
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,120
grow autos you can correct me from wrong

223
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:21,758
there but are you indoor grower outdoor

224
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,240
grower do you grow in soil coco hydro

225
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,400
organic synthetic what's your grow style

226
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,280
when growing autos

227
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,159
yeah so i do primarily grow autos i do

228
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,559
have

229
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,200
my first photo period seeds that have

230
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,439
sprouted they're just a few days old so

231
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,519
i will be going down that route and

232
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,560
experiencing that but

233
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,080
i also primarily grow indoors

234
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,399
i grow in

235
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,120
grow tints i have two two foot by four

236
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,839
foot grow tents by six foot high

237
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,720
just led lights and

238
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,920
one of them i've got an auto pot system

239
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,600
set up

240
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,519
and i know you're familiar with that

241
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,519
that's just an automatic gravity fed

242
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,200
watering system that feeds the plants

243
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,278
from the bottom up

244
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,959
and then in the other tent

245
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:12,559
i just hand water in pots and um

246
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:14,879
i've only had two tints for

247
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,958
just under a year so i don't really have

248
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,399
a a certain

249
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,159
you know

250
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,080
system going with the tents or anything

251
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,879
like that but basically one's just hand

252
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,959
watered and one's automatically watered

253
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,679
um one of them i

254
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:33,199
typically grow my own personal herbs in

255
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,958
and the other one i actually um

256
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,278
i chuck pollen i don't want to say a

257
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:41,838
breed i chuck pollen and um and and

258
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,759
produce seeds so one of one of them is

259
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,519
kind of set apart for that and the other

260
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,519
one is set apart for

261
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,360
um my own medicine

262
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,600
and then as far as soil um i grow in i

263
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,000
guess we can we call it soil but it's

264
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,879
it's really a a grow medium right it's

265
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,440
uh you know uh we call it soil but it's

266
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,958
peat moss based you know like typical

267
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,279
potting soil

268
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,119
with perlite and a little bit of compost

269
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:10,078
added in

270
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,720
i do prefer to grow organic i went

271
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:15,199
organic a couple of years ago

272
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,240
about three years ago and

273
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,920
i

274
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,519
kind of dabbled a little bit in the

275
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:22,240
synthetics as well

276
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,200
um but i find myself really being drawn

277
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,560
to the organics and really nerding out

278
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,800
on

279
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:31,199
the soil food web and microbes and

280
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,879
things like that so i'm really

281
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,879
really kind of treading down a path

282
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,838
right now of getting deeper and deeper

283
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,360
into

284
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,200
organics

285
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,919
but as far as right now

286
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,120
i just grow in

287
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:47,039
an amended potting soil you know with

288
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,759
right now i just got dry amendments by

289
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,159
down to earth i just mixed them up and

290
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,480
did a super a super soil type grow like

291
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,480
a sub cool um you know

292
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,720
type method that's what i'm doing right

293
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,759
now previously i was using nature's

294
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,519
living soil concentrates those worked

295
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,000
well for me too

296
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,600
and then um i'm also going to be testing

297
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,958
out foop

298
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,519
sent me

299
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,439
a little beginner line of their their

300
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,200
entire product i don't know if you've

301
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,600
heard of them so

302
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,040
they're an organic bottled nutrient

303
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,519
company

304
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:24,639
and it's called food f-o-o-p

305
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,560
and it's basically made from fish poo

306
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,199
and they've got a bloom and a veg and a

307
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,559
sweetener and and things like that so um

308
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,240
they just sent it to me so i'm just

309
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,759
going to be testing that out

310
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,360
and

311
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,480
seeing how that goes

312
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,600
so i i really do um i'm pretty i'm an

313
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,959
organic guy and and as time goes by that

314
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,440
passion and that style of growing is is

315
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,439
growing for me itself i just i keep

316
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,120
getting more and more into it

317
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,680
right now i'm getting into some natural

318
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,078
farming practices and trying to learn

319
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:59,039
some different things with that

320
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:01,679
just made my own lactic acid bacteria

321
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:04,078
serum i did my first indigenous

322
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,958
microorganism collection i just made my

323
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,039
own

324
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,719
water soluble calcium

325
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,879
by roasting eggshells and soaking them

326
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,839
in vinegar for a week things like that

327
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,600
you know save money and uh

328
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,760
and and resource my food waste and just

329
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,519
things like that you know totally going

330
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,639
going down the organic rabbit hole for

331
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,240
sure

332
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,639
that's awesome so let's dive into autos

333
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,320
i think we should start with the pros

334
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,320
and cons to autos i know you have a

335
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,680
whole video on this on your channel

336
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,240
really good video actually show them my

337
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,838
youtube recommended feed i think it blew

338
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,440
up um because youtube's been

339
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,440
recommending it everywhere they still

340
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,639
recommend it even though i've watched it

341
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,880
but there is a lot of pros to autos and

342
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,240
there's a lot of cons to autos right can

343
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,958
you talk to us about some of the pros

344
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,360
and cons to growing autos

345
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:56,239
yeah absolutely man um

346
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,320
i mean some of the pros to start off uh

347
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,839
they grow really fast and i think that's

348
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,120
something that attracts a lot of people

349
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,360
to them

350
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,720
um from the time that they sprout

351
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,839
from the soil um you know often times

352
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,120
within

353
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,600
70 75 days on average they're they're

354
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,360
finished from the day they sprout

355
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,200
some of them even earlier

356
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,600
some of them will you know be done

357
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,720
within 55 to 60 days some really fast

358
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,639
ones and still get fairly large as well

359
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,240
and

360
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,919
you know some of them some of them will

361
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,839
go 90 days but for the most part they're

362
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,399
just super fast you know you pop them in

363
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,120
the soil and once they germinate they

364
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,120
just take off like a freight train

365
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,159
and uh and within

366
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,759
you know 60 to 90 days you're harvesting

367
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,519
your plant

368
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,519
that's definitely

369
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,720
definitely one of the cons or the pros

370
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,198
i'm sorry

371
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,120
another pro is that

372
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,439
it's a day neutral plant

373
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,000
so which means it doesn't require a

374
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,959
specific light cycle to flower

375
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,078
so it doesn't matter if you are under 18

376
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:05,359
hours of light or 12 or even 24 with no

377
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,000
darkness

378
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,159
they'll flower regardlessly based off of

379
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,480
genetics and not based off of

380
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,958
a light cycle whereas a traditional you

381
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,759
know traditional photo period plants of

382
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,759
any species uh you know they require a

383
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:24,159
certain amount of of light and darkness

384
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,039
to trigger that flowering in them so

385
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,879
that's

386
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,759
that's a pro and it's a pro to a lot of

387
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:32,480
people because if you've got some room

388
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,958
if you've got a veg tint and let's say

389
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,800
you've got a corner a space or a spot i

390
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,759
mean you can throw just throw an auto in

391
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,639
there and

392
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:42,879
let it go if you're you know growing

393
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,320
tomatoes and peppers and whatever else

394
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,399
you're growing and there's a couple of

395
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,879
areas and you want to throw an auto in

396
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,600
there like why not fill up the space

397
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,320
um so you know things like things like

398
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,000
that are beneficial

399
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,680
they're great for concentrates as well a

400
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,039
lot of people are actually

401
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,198
growing them because of the fact that

402
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,360
they grow so fast they're able to turn

403
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,559
them around and press them and

404
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,919
and create

405
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:10,479
concentrates right from the flowers

406
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:13,439
so it's a super fast turnaround they

407
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,440
provide a lot of oil and resin and stuff

408
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,880
uh that your traditional photo period

409
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,639
plants

410
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,278
will produce uh of course you know

411
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,440
depending on genetics but um but yeah i

412
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,039
mean for the most part

413
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,360
you know they're just as just as

414
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,120
powerful

415
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,360
as long as you get good genetics you

416
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,240
know and and they just grow they just

417
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,919
grow really fast man

418
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,278
another thing that's great about them is

419
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,278
if you keep them all under the same

420
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,720
light cycle and you've got one area with

421
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,039
one light cycle you can just do a

422
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,320
constant perpetual grow of different

423
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:45,838
ages

424
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,680
um

425
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,600
you know they they actually will take a

426
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,198
lot less light and that's not something

427
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,360
i'm really familiar with um i think

428
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:55,278
that's something that maybe

429
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,860
is better

430
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:58,078
chatted with with dr bruce

431
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,159
[Music]

432
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,919
but as far as the dli and stuff with

433
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,919
with autos um

434
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,000
i'm not sure what that looks like but

435
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,479
but i do know in general i think they're

436
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,278
going to require a little less intense

437
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,759
light because it's on for say 18 hours

438
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:15,759
instead of 12 so your dli

439
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,039
is going to change with that for those

440
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,039
light nerds

441
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,559
that's about as far as i can go with it

442
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,399
unfortunately because i don't know much

443
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,479
about that but

444
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,440
those are some of the pros

445
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,680
of growing autos there are some cons

446
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,120
there are cons to them absolutely for

447
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,758
sure like anything

448
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,919
i think the biggest one being that they

449
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,839
automatically flower that that could be

450
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,360
the biggest con and i think it's a lot

451
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,880
of these things are subjective right

452
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,120
like depending on

453
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,360
who the grower is and and what they're

454
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,360
looking for and what their style is and

455
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,879
what their goals are

456
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,000
but the fact that it automatically

457
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:53,439
flowers can be a problem especially for

458
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,480
a new grower

459
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,399
um if you encounter any deficiencies

460
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,159
let's say you're in you're in a

461
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,839
vegetative stage let's say it's it's

462
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,600
been two weeks

463
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,798
let's say you're like in a potting soil

464
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,279
of some kind maybe like a fox farm happy

465
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:12,240
frog it's pretty popular potting soil

466
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,399
for people to start out in

467
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,318
that potting soil in particular is it

468
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,240
can tend to be

469
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,159
more on the inert side i guess you can

470
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,120
say there's not a whole lot of compost

471
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,480
or worm castings or humic acid and like

472
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,000
all that different stuff there's not a

473
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,000
whole lot of it in

474
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,640
happy frog as as compared to ocean

475
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,240
forest say with the fox farm brand

476
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,080
so if you sprout in something like that

477
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,038
within a few weeks the plant's going to

478
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,720
run out of food you're going to be

479
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:38,798
showing deficiencies

480
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,440
if you're not um

481
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:45,119
purposeful and proactive about

482
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,360
feeding that plant or making sure that

483
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,599
you're set up for that next stage and

484
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:52,159
you show deficiencies you don't have a

485
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,918
whole lot of time to correct those

486
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,480
because the plants going to end up going

487
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,440
into flower on its own and of course

488
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,880
once you see the deficiencies

489
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,960
you know what what's happening in the

490
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,480
soil has already happened and you're now

491
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,558
just seeing it

492
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,319
in the leaves so

493
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:09,839
that could be a problem you know if

494
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,359
you're if you're learning to grow and

495
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,879
you're running it or even if you're an

496
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,519
experienced grower you know and you run

497
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,640
into deficiencies

498
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,879
it's going to be an issue for you

499
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,400
because you don't have that time to slow

500
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,160
down and fix it and say you know i'm

501
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,160
going to wait another week before i flip

502
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,759
into flour i'm going to wait another two

503
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,720
or i'm going to train it out a little

504
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:28,960
bit more

505
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,120
you don't have that that that

506
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,759
opportunity and i think that could be

507
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,678
one of the biggest cons

508
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,759
one of the biggest cons to it

509
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,960
i think the second largest

510
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:43,519
con would be that you can't clone them

511
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,759
and so if you find a cultivar that

512
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,720
you're in love with or that you really

513
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:49,759
liked or that uh helped you in some way

514
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,160
um

515
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,960
you can't just clone that and keep it

516
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,880
around uh you now you can clone it now

517
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,480
let me be literal here

518
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,440
you can clone it

519
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,480
um

520
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,640
and it'll root but it's not going to do

521
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,079
anything for you the best that i've ever

522
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,200
seen done

523
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:12,720
was a friend of mine in san diego

524
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,640
and she um cloned it twice she cloned

525
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,480
her original and then cloned that one

526
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,120
again and just had kind of this

527
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,200
consecutive harvest but each clone was

528
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:23,519
smaller and smaller

529
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,759
so as you can imagine that's

530
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,200
a waste of time i mean in my opinion

531
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,359
unless you're like really in love with

532
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,279
that strain

533
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,798
so you can't clone them

534
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,599
um

535
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,480
another con right now at least is

536
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,319
there's

537
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,798
there's a lot of bad genetics running

538
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:43,678
around when it comes to autos in general

539
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,798
a lot of facebook backyard um

540
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,120
you know

541
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:50,000
pollen chucker bro breeder

542
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:52,479
uh genetics and you know some of them

543
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
are okay you know not everybody is like

544
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,440
that so i don't wanna

545
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,640
you know speak i don't wanna paint a

546
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,400
wide brush for everybody but um

547
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,720
my biggest caution would be to stay away

548
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,480
from these facebook groups man um

549
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,720
because a lot of these facebook groups

550
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,120
you got guys on there you know selling

551
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,000
their uh you know there's their pollen

552
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,759
chuck seeds for 50 bucks for five of

553
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
them you know and

554
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,200
they you know only two of them sprout

555
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,400
one of them's

556
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,400
a female and that one is just wanky and

557
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,400
doesn't get anywhere and you just gotta

558
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,720
be have discernment like with anything

559
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,640
and just be careful but that's a con

560
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,240
there's a lot of crazy genetics running

561
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,360
around right now

562
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,839
um

563
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,759
and i think another con and i kind of

564
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,839
touched on this already but uh is that

565
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,519
they may not be the best to learn on

566
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,480
you know they may not be the best uh

567
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,639
plant

568
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,480
to learn on um and for the reasons that

569
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,280
i spoke about a bit automatically

570
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,079
flowering because with a photo period um

571
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,480
which ironically i've never grown until

572
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,639
now but with a photo period

573
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,759
you know you have that opportunity so i

574
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,559
think those are uh probably the biggest

575
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:02,240
bullet points as far as pros and cons go

576
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:05,279
yeah i think you touched upon a lot of

577
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,519
good ones both pros and cons you know

578
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:10,319
one of the things that you mentioned is

579
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,679
if there's any sort of stunt growth

580
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,079
while the plant is in the vegetation

581
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,440
stage you could potentially impact yield

582
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:17,199
right it's going to negatively impact

583
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,880
yield if you have a stunt growth it's

584
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,640
going to automatically flower

585
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,360
so i agree with you it might not be the

586
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,280
best for new growers to start with

587
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,439
autoflowers right you have much more

588
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,279
control with photo periods so yeah i

589
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,000
think that's that's a big one i feel

590
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:34,079
like because of that

591
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,558
because that stunt growth and the

592
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,399
vegetation stage could negatively impact

593
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,319
yield a lot of people are planting

594
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,480
autoflower seeds in the final container

595
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,480
they're avoiding that transplant process

596
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,200
right so my question for you is what pot

597
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,120
size do you grow autos in are you

598
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,798
starting in a small container and then

599
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:53,119
transplanting your way up to a larger

600
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:55,119
container or you just starting out in a

601
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:58,158
large container and avoiding that

602
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,759
transplant process altogether

603
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,600
i do both

604
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,919
to be honest with you and it's just

605
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,519
simply because i just

606
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,159
get itches up my butt and i like to

607
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,400
experience at things and experiment you

608
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,080
know what i mean i just i just i do both

609
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,440
for the most part i start in the final

610
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:17,119
container

611
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,880
um you can transplant autos but you do

612
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:20,798
have to be careful and you do have to do

613
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,840
them um

614
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:26,158
at the right time to avoid that stunting

615
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:28,240
you know you definitely in my opinion

616
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,600
want to transplant them well before the

617
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,720
stretch

618
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:35,359
um you also want to transplant them

619
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,000
before they get too root bound in their

620
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:40,798
container so for example if you start in

621
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,599
a solo cup

622
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,440
typically and i get this from my friend

623
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,678
dan full duplex

624
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,720
typically when those leaves hit the

625
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:53,360
outer edge of that solo cup

626
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,360
your your the roots of that auto is most

627
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:58,240
likely hit the bottom and just starting

628
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:01,038
to kind of circle around down there

629
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,640
for some odd reason and this is

630
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:06,879
totally anecdotal with just me and a few

631
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,720
people we just all kind of agree that

632
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,559
for some reason if they're when they're

633
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,798
started in a really small pot if you

634
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:15,200
don't transplant them quick enough they

635
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:16,879
will become root bound and they'll it

636
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,798
for some it seems to trigger them in the

637
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,559
flower a little bit earlier almost like

638
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:22,960
anything less than one gallon now i'm

639
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:24,639
not claiming that scientifically i'm not

640
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,798
claiming that as bro science either i'm

641
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,960
just kind of some of us have been like

642
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,879
that's that's interesting you know

643
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,919
so you want to

644
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,919
um

645
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,759
you want to get it out of that that solo

646
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,360
cup if that's what you're starting in

647
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,839
once the leaves kind of hit that outer

648
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:42,158
edge i use that rule of thumb for any

649
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,519
size container i start in

650
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,919
sometimes i'll start like in a half

651
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,679
gallon pot that's what i did recently i

652
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,320
started in half gallon pots i was kind

653
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,240
of doing a miniature final hunt so i

654
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,798
started in small pots

655
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,359
once the leaves hit the edges

656
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:58,639
the plants had showed sex

657
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,479
and so

658
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,559
i went ahead and just transplanted the

659
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,159
ones that i wanted to keep and move

660
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,079
those ones forward if you don't

661
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,000
transplant them in time they're just

662
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,119
going to end up getting root bound and

663
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,880
they're going to end up going into

664
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:12,079
flower and then if you transplant them

665
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,880
you're just going to really stunt them

666
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,960
even more so transplanting is possible

667
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,559
and and it's and it's it's it's very

668
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,480
doable it's just you really got to pay

669
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,158
attention and kind of

670
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,519
do it at the right time

671
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,799
you know because that it just it's going

672
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:26,400
to keep going and it's on a time

673
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:27,759
schedule you know the clock is just

674
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,600
ticking and ticking and ticking and

675
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,440
ticking so you don't

676
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:32,639
you don't want to mess that up you know

677
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,360
some people are going to claim that

678
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,720
transplanting is is beneficial because

679
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,399
then they have the opportunity to

680
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,079
sprinkle some mycorrhizal fungi onto the

681
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,840
roots right it's going to attach the

682
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,158
root system be an extension of the root

683
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,158
system help with nutrient uptake so

684
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,919
transplanting be they're able to

685
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,440
sprinkle directly onto the roots i

686
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,960
personally like to do like a third cup

687
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,159
of worm castings put that in the bottom

688
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,720
of the hole that's going to definitely

689
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,880
help with beneficial microbes you know

690
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,640
and it's close to the root zone so i've

691
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,960
had good luck doing that

692
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,480
that's a good idea what size container

693
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,038
are you in five gallons or even seven

694
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,558
gallons or what all over the place man

695
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:12,640
so in my auto pots they're 3.9 gallons

696
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:14,960
but i'm considering upgrading to the 6.6

697
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,278
gallons i think they are

698
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,519
and the reason being is is because they

699
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,519
end up running out of uh out of food and

700
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,200
top dressing is challenging and stuff

701
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,558
with those because they're bottom fed so

702
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,360
typically three

703
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:30,798
3.9 gallons for the auto pots

704
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,558
in my other tint if i'm if i'm doing

705
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,079
like any type of pollen chucking or

706
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:36,639
anything like that i usually grow in

707
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,639
small pots so that i can

708
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,600
sprout a bunch of them and

709
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,080
kind of weed out the ones i don't want

710
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,959
and if not then i actually like to put

711
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:47,918
two

712
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,600
ten gallon pots in a two by four tint

713
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,200
and just grow two

714
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:52,480
just two of them in that two by four

715
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,558
tent um

716
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,159
is is great too because in a ten gallon

717
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:57,839
pot

718
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,760
you know i can mix up a super soil and

719
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,038
it'll have plenty in there to get that

720
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:03,519
thing through those whole life with a

721
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,038
true a more true water only

722
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,278
and uh

723
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:09,519
and it'll you know they'll fill up

724
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,599
a two by four tent easily to two plants

725
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,319
in a 10 gallon pot so i'm kind of all

726
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,839
over the place man to be honest with you

727
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,639
okay yeah you've tried a whole bunch of

728
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:22,240
things there yeah i just i'm always just

729
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,559
doing different stuff you know but um

730
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,720
but as far as like pot size and what i

731
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:30,240
would suggest i mean in my opinion it's

732
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,240
a lot of this stuff is just kind of

733
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,640
subjective as again what you're doing

734
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,558
what your goals are what your grow area

735
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,840
looks like um if you're in a really

736
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:42,240
small area and you've got a ceiling

737
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,000
max height then you might consider

738
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,420
smaller pots

739
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,679
you know

740
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:48,480
[Music]

741
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,400
just things like that yeah for sure i

742
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,480
want to back up and go back to your

743
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,000
starting mix you touch base on it a

744
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,400
little bit and you mentioned that you're

745
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,480
mostly in peat mixture with perlite

746
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,840
you're using down to earth nutrients can

747
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,880
you be a little bit more specific on

748
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,000
like you know what's your ratio of peat

749
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,240
aeration

750
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,079
and what specific amendments you're

751
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,679
mixing in to begin with

752
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:12,399
yeah so

753
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,720
i'm actually um right now i'm actually

754
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,640
using bagged potting soil this last run

755
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,960
i actually used ocean forest because i

756
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,278
had three or four bags laying around i

757
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,840
plan on getting away from that

758
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:25,919
just to save some money but

759
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:26,798
from what i understand that's a typical

760
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,559
you know

761
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:32,240
333 of um you know like peat moss

762
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:33,519
compost and then a narration like

763
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,359
paralyte

764
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,200
i would like to get away from perlite

765
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:40,000
because when i hand water it all just

766
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,798
kind of tends to float to the top

767
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,798
i'm thinking of going with rice holes

768
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:47,599
because of their

769
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:49,679
their aeration quality as well as you

770
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,359
know that they break down provide silica

771
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,159
to your plant but

772
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,000
there's been some talk about

773
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,600
something um

774
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,960
i don't know man like something i forget

775
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:00,558
what it is but there's been some talk

776
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,480
about how they can produce some type of

777
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,879
negative chemical or something if i'm

778
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,798
not mistaken but i don't know

779
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,919
so the the potting soil it's already

780
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:12,879
bagged up and then what i did this round

781
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,278
now what i usually do is i've been using

782
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,520
nature's living soil and so that's just

783
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,200
a concentrate that they provide to you

784
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:22,158
which is basically like a bunch of dry

785
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,000
amendments already uh kind of cooked up

786
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,559
you know by the microbial life and it's

787
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,119
readily available it also has microbes

788
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:30,480
in it that's typically what i would use

789
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,319
before

790
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,159
and i would just add that to a happy

791
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,158
frog or an ocean forest

792
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:41,359
or pro mix or any of those those potting

793
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,679
soils you add that to like the bottom

794
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,199
third or mix it thoroughly and it's

795
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,360
supposed to be like a pretty much a

796
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,759
water only all the way through

797
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:52,639
um what i'm doing now is i've switched

798
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:55,359
gears and i bought all of the um dry

799
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,960
amendments uh to make my own super soil

800
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,759
from down to earth

801
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,759
and this is my first time doing it

802
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,919
so i can't really speak as to how it's

803
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,879
working or anything like that i've just

804
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,520
got some seedlings that just sprouted up

805
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,278
that are in their final pots in that mix

806
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,679
but what i did

807
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:16,240
was i just mixed that into the bottom

808
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,120
half and then the top half i just did

809
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,839
ocean forest so the idea is and some

810
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:24,079
people say ocean forest is too hot for

811
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:27,119
autos

812
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,918
i have never had one auto have an issue

813
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,239
so

814
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:33,038
um i mean to each their own uh but

815
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,880
that's just been my experience so um i

816
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:37,759
start seedlings in that stuff with no

817
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,480
issues so on the top half of my pot i

818
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:44,398
have got fox farm ocean forest

819
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,919
and i did add perlite um i like to add

820
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:47,678
you know quite a bit i like to have

821
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,278
really really really well draining

822
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,880
aerated soil

823
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:56,558
and so um the bottom half is

824
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:59,600
ocean forest with the uh dry amendments

825
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:02,480
mixed up inside of them

826
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:04,879
and so basically you know my seed will

827
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,440
just pop up and it will grow in that

828
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,600
ocean forest and when it's in the plant

829
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,440
is mature enough and it's a little a

830
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:15,918
little more established it'll hit that

831
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,360
super soil and it'll begin to use that

832
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,440
to uptake those nutrients that the

833
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,278
microbes have been breaking down for the

834
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,880
last couple of weeks

835
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:26,480
so that's kind of where i'm at right now

836
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,399
i'm not sure if i'm just going to keep

837
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,919
going down that route

838
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,398
i'm considering

839
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,320
getting into purchasing like a two foot

840
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:36,639
by four foot bed

841
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:39,599
and getting some peat moss and some rice

842
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,799
holes and some of my own compost and

843
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:45,519
make start starting my own living soil

844
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,679
uh indoors but that's i've got a lot to

845
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,839
learn when it comes to that and i don't

846
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,159
want to just pull the trigger on that

847
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:53,359
without doing my my research first you

848
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,000
know because i don't want to waste my

849
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:58,240
time it's uh it's an investment

850
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,919
you know yeah you mess things up then

851
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,919
you mess things up and

852
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,000
your overall result might not be

853
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,399
what you anticipated unfortunately yeah

854
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,839
so let's dive a little bit deeper into

855
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:09,518
nutrients right so we talked about your

856
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:11,439
starting mix when you're not doing the

857
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,278
super soil method that you talked about

858
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,278
right you're just using bag soil

859
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:17,278
eventually the nutrients are going to

860
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:19,679
deplete in the medium right so this is

861
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:22,000
going to highly depend on the pot size

862
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,480
right if you're in a larger pot size

863
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,919
with more soil more nutrients in there

864
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,919
it's going to take longer for that plant

865
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,519
to work through it versus a smaller pot

866
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,440
size let's say a three gallon grill pot

867
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,159
for example so say you're in a smaller

868
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,360
grill pot and you need to feed the plant

869
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,159
you know you need to feed the plant the

870
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,678
nutrients i know you said you're organic

871
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,000
what nutrients i think you mentioned

872
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,840
down to earth what nutrients are you

873
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,480
using and when are you feeding

874
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:51,839
okay so typically

875
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,240
i did mix um so prior to my

876
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:56,639
dry amendment grow that i'm doing now

877
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,240
like i said i'd mix nature's living soil

878
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,880
so then that would have

879
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,038
enough nutrients to get me through

880
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,840
usually

881
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:08,720
until you know mid-flower

882
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:11,199
um and then mid-flower is is when i

883
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,200
would um start to see deficiencies or

884
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,080
run into issues

885
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,759
and um so with with autos a lot of times

886
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:19,519
you can get through your veg without

887
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:20,879
adding any veg nutrients if you really

888
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,720
don't want to

889
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,720
and depending on what type of soil

890
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,600
you're in a lot of people like will grow

891
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,640
an ocean forest for example and then

892
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:33,439
when their autoflower goes into bloom

893
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,000
um they will then just begin adding

894
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,278
their bloom nutrients or top dressing

895
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,960
you know bloom

896
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:40,960
type dry amendments

897
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,399
and stuff like that so but what i would

898
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,360
do is um i would let the plant grow

899
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:48,000
and then

900
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:50,798
uh what i like to do now is right when

901
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,599
it starts to go into flower

902
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:53,839
and

903
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:56,240
what i mean by that is

904
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,398
you know when when the flowering spots

905
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,919
are starting to you know really spit out

906
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:03,599
some of those um white pistols and stuff

907
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,240
at that point

908
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,719
i like to top dress

909
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,440
and begin feeding teas

910
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,919
so what i'll do is

911
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,558
when it starts to go into flower um

912
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,480
nature's living soil makes this product

913
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,480
called girl flower power and it's made

914
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,839
for bloom and it's of course it's

915
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,079
something that we can make on our own

916
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:28,079
but you just sprinkle that on top and

917
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:30,480
maybe etch it in a little bit and water

918
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,240
over it and let that you know kind of

919
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,960
get in there and that'll begin to break

920
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,880
down and feed the plants and then i also

921
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,640
like to brew teas

922
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,960
whether that's just an earthworm

923
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,278
castings tea to add microbial life

924
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,679
itself and some nutrients

925
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:48,079
or nutrient teas right where your your

926
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,080
plant is actually being fed in organic

927
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:51,759
tea where it can uptake certain things

928
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:54,398
right away

929
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:57,599
it's a benefit of the girl flower power

930
00:33:54,398 --> 00:34:01,119
is that it contains microbes and and

931
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:02,879
diverse microbial life but it also has

932
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,959
readily available nutrients for your

933
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,039
plants because it's already basically

934
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,878
those dry amendments have already been

935
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:11,358
cooked so to speak have already been

936
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:13,440
broken down and readily available forms

937
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:16,559
for the plant

938
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,079
so between the top dressing and a tea

939
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:19,679
um

940
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,760
you know the top dressing i like to

941
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,720
sprinkle a little bit on and kind of

942
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,639
water it in and then let it let it go

943
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,239
for maybe another week and then sprinkle

944
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,559
a little more and just little bits at a

945
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,719
time and then just feed teas and let the

946
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:36,000
tea go to work and uh that'll usually

947
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:38,239
get me through um you know till the end

948
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,280
so it's not a lot not a lot really not a

949
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,878
lot of feeding going on

950
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,240
and these days i'm really trying to

951
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:46,078
focus more

952
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,319
on feeding the soil

953
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,399
rather than feeding the plant um with my

954
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,519
own kind of grow technique and what i'm

955
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:56,000
into so and you know it's it's i i tend

956
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:58,800
to focus more on

957
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,239
the quality the end quality and the of

958
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,599
course everybody wants volume um you

959
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:08,639
know i i prefer my my my my red

960
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,559
delicious apples to be huge if i if if i

961
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,319
can you know i want to enjoy it you know

962
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,078
but i i'm more concerned about the

963
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,559
quality of that apple as well or the

964
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:21,119
quality of the herbs as well

965
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:23,039
and i try not to just push for size um

966
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,800
in looks and things like that i try to

967
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,759
really dial it in because i'm using this

968
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,800
stuff

969
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,280
as medicine you know more so than

970
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,000
recreational um

971
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,160
so i try to

972
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,039
you know just focus on the in quality

973
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:41,118
and as far as um you know terpenes and

974
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:44,320
and different things like that

975
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,920
that are going to help me medically so

976
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,160
growing organic works great for that

977
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,400
because i'm not trying to grow monster

978
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,440
plants or trying to push anything too

979
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,160
hard

980
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,320
it's just not my uh just not my thing

981
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:57,679
yeah i totally get what you mean

982
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,800
let's uh let's switch it up let's talk

983
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:02,960
about environment for autos right so

984
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,079
what temperature and humidity do you

985
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,240
typically aim for when growing autos

986
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,720
the same as photos

987
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:12,719
typically i mean really anywhere if i

988
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:14,719
can keep it anywhere

989
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:16,239
really if i can keep it around 50

990
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:18,879
through the whole grow that would be

991
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:21,199
great i do try to tailor it a little

992
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,880
more earlier in its life i try to get

993
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:24,559
the humidity up right now i've got some

994
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,880
seedlings and i've got the humidity up

995
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:28,799
to about 70 percent

996
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,559
um

997
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,039
when they begin to grow and get a little

998
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,440
bit bigger um i'll drop that down

999
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,358
personally i try i try to mess with the

1000
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,159
humidity it's difficult for me because i

1001
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:42,960
live in a pretty arid dry environment so

1002
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:45,279
the humidity can change very fast as far

1003
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,440
as declining for me

1004
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,599
so i i'm constantly battling to keep it

1005
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,320
up to keep it up

1006
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,760
so if i can just keep it at around 50

1007
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,519
basically through the whole grow and

1008
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,320
maybe drop it a little bit during flower

1009
00:36:55,519 --> 00:37:00,800
which is really easy for me um then i'm

1010
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,640
happy yeah that's but you know to be

1011
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,320
honest man

1012
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:08,159
um i've grown them uh outdoors during

1013
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,640
like right now during the winter it's

1014
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,319
january i've had plants out there um a

1015
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,480
couple of years ago right now in

1016
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,640
southern california and you know it'll

1017
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,719
be 60 during the day

1018
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:23,920
and drop down to 32 30 to 29 sometimes

1019
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:25,199
at night and if i don't have too many of

1020
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,400
those nights of that freezing

1021
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,118
temperatures

1022
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,440
i've grown some some pretty good looking

1023
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,680
large plants outdoors in the winter in

1024
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,838
the cold

1025
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:37,919
it's not too humid here so i don't have

1026
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:39,519
to worry about any type of rot or

1027
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,920
anything like that

1028
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:43,838
and uh it's you know it's and it's sunny

1029
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,800
it's sunny southern california so but

1030
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:46,480
you know

1031
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,880
i do try to

1032
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,880
to dial it in man as much as i can you

1033
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,200
know in my indoor environment of course

1034
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,800
to to just get that extra little umph

1035
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,559
you know a lot of people don't know that

1036
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,800
these plants are resilient right there's

1037
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,400
an optimal range for conditions right

1038
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,039
and then there's a tolerance range so

1039
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,039
there's a large range that these plants

1040
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:06,800
were able to survive in right so cold

1041
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,400
nights are common outdoors and the plant

1042
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,119
still survives you know it's within

1043
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,880
their tolerance range

1044
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,599
yeah i think that tolerant range is is

1045
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,280
wider than a lot of people think it is

1046
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,320
yeah and temperatures you know pretty

1047
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,320
much the same as photos um i do like to

1048
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,119
run warm if i can

1049
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:28,000
i prefer to hit like 80 maybe even up to

1050
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,039
82. some people think that's a little

1051
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,800
warm

1052
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,279
but in my environment i noticed that

1053
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,519
that kind of tends to have the best uh

1054
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,680
fastest growth for me

1055
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:39,199
um and when you're using led lights i

1056
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,118
think there's might there may be some

1057
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:42,799
science to that of being able to run

1058
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,240
things warmer or something i'm not sure

1059
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,880
but um

1060
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:49,919
yeah you know environment um the more

1061
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,039
that i can dial in my environment uh the

1062
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,519
better

1063
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:56,400
my plants and more healthier my plants

1064
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,679
are going to be and going to grow so i

1065
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,760
do try

1066
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,919
to dial it in but you're right man i

1067
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,800
mean these you know plants they want to

1068
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,639
live

1069
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,039
you know they just want to live

1070
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:09,598
i've got a mandarin orange tree that i

1071
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:11,920
was gone for eight months caring for my

1072
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,519
grandma and when i came home

1073
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,200
it was almost dead i had only been

1074
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:17,519
coming home like on the weekends

1075
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:19,118
sometimes and uh

1076
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,000
i ended up just chopping that thing

1077
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,838
about four inches from the soil and i'll

1078
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,280
be darned man i came out there in the

1079
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:27,440
spring and that thing had little green

1080
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,519
leaves on it and now that thing is about

1081
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,079
six and a half feet tall

1082
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:34,480
and it just those little sucker leaves

1083
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,560
grew and i braided them and it was

1084
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,000
really cool man but these plants won't

1085
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:39,279
they want to live they're like you and i

1086
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,400
they want to live every everything

1087
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,160
that's alive has a will to survive

1088
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,559
you know even microbial life everything

1089
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:49,679
wants to live and uh

1090
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:51,679
so it it's it's um they'll do well man

1091
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,440
you know they'll do well in environments

1092
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:56,559
i've i've grown them like in the in the

1093
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,920
rain and just all it's not ideal but um

1094
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,480
i've done it

1095
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,400
you know yeah a lot of people that are

1096
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,760
okay with the you know just being in the

1097
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,680
tolerance range but there are some

1098
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,000
people that want to really dial things

1099
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:10,639
in and be in the optimal ranges let's

1100
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,639
talk about co2 co2 is something that's

1101
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:16,159
often supplemented when growing indoors

1102
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:17,920
do you supplement co2 at all i don't

1103
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:20,879
um

1104
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,119
and i'm i don't because i just i'm not

1105
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,760
educated on it and i'm not sure as far

1106
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,640
as like you know an exhale bag or a tnb

1107
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,599
naturals um no i don't

1108
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:31,598
um

1109
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,960
i'm not educated on that really as far

1110
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,119
as

1111
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,119
how that works and and being able to add

1112
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:39,760
more light and

1113
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,400
and things like that um i'm not

1114
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,640
convinced necessarily

1115
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,599
that that those products really do

1116
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:50,480
anything um i don't understand it uh if

1117
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,960
someone can explain it to me i'd

1118
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,280
be great but um yeah i just i don't

1119
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,119
supplement uh co2 just because i'm not

1120
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,800
i'm not convinced that it that it works

1121
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,440
you can cut that out if you've got like

1122
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,839
any type of deals with anybody dude

1123
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,838
like tmv natural or somebody yeah i just

1124
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:08,078
uh i'm just not i just don't uh i don't

1125
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:10,799
supplement co2 i've used the tmb

1126
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,318
naturals canisters i used for quite some

1127
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,720
time and i actually did put a co2

1128
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:17,119
monitor in the room and it actually does

1129
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:19,838
work there was often times where it

1130
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,039
averaged on around 800 900 ppm and of

1131
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:22,799
course it's going to depend on how much

1132
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:25,599
you exhaust i was exhausting

1133
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,880
intermittently i also now i start using

1134
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,039
the mushroom bags

1135
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,358
and so i use the exhale bag the mushroom

1136
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:33,679
bag i have it hanging above the plants

1137
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:36,480
the top part of my grow tent and within

1138
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:38,000
a couple weeks that whole substrate was

1139
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,480
really inoculated i mean the whole

1140
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,639
thing's like white at this point and i

1141
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,240
don't have my co2 monitor in there i

1142
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:46,239
have one of the older ones we have to

1143
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:48,078
actually hook it up to the wall and it's

1144
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:49,439
like this big basically the size of

1145
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,200
softball for those that are that are

1146
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,519
listening in on one of the podcast

1147
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:55,838
platforms there really needs to be more

1148
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,599
companies releasing co2 monitors i mean

1149
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:59,440
i'm about to talk to ac infinity and be

1150
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,440
like dude if you guys release a co2

1151
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,920
monitor it'll fly off the shelf because

1152
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,400
nobody has co2 monitors right now that

1153
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,559
are affordable right i mean i know pulse

1154
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,720
has one but i think theirs is connected

1155
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:12,880
to like a it's like a 500 device because

1156
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:14,480
it also has like par and it has

1157
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,000
temperature humidity all that stuff

1158
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,679
worth the money you know because you can

1159
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,760
actually measure par so for a lot of

1160
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:21,118
people they say it's worth the money but

1161
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,920
you know i'd really love to see a

1162
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,760
standalone co2 monitor that hooks up to

1163
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,760
your app so you can see the different

1164
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,800
levels throughout the day along with

1165
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,960
temperature and humidity i mean soon i

1166
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,160
mean if you're a company listening build

1167
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,480
you know make it right now because

1168
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:38,799
that'll that'll for sure fly off the

1169
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,240
shelves i'm confident of that one

1170
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,640
yeah i think that would help everybody

1171
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:44,719
out you know and um i by no means in

1172
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:46,799
saying that they don't work i i just

1173
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:48,559
personally was was i haven't been

1174
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,400
convinced but i mean you've got a co2

1175
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:51,838
monitor and you're you're monitoring it

1176
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,838
and it's up but

1177
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:55,358
um you know i've got some some friends

1178
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:57,039
who have done the same thing and it

1179
00:42:55,358 --> 00:43:00,000
shoots up to eight or nine hundred but

1180
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:02,960
but within 24 to 48 hours it's it's back

1181
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,519
down low and it doesn't hike back up um

1182
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,920
even when they're shaking the bottles or

1183
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,280
and stuff like that so um i just

1184
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,200
personally just haven't pulled the

1185
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,280
trigger on it but you're right man a

1186
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:15,279
monitor would be great you know an

1187
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,880
affordable one so people like me can be

1188
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,760
like well let's try this out for myself

1189
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,599
you know

1190
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,359
exactly exactly

1191
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,760
how about plant training let's get into

1192
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:25,679
that a little bit it's a highly debated

1193
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,520
topic right we talk about some of the

1194
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,598
types of training so low stress training

1195
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:31,679
i think a lot of people do with

1196
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,680
autos in particular definitely helps

1197
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:35,039
with kind of having those even colas you

1198
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:36,159
prevent that

1199
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,759
you know the plant growing christmas

1200
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:39,679
tree style and have one big main cold

1201
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,119
that's at risk for for bud rod mold to

1202
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:43,199
get in in the middle of it due to lack

1203
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,960
of air flow so on and so forth so low

1204
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,879
stress chaining is very very common

1205
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,199
topping is one of those things that are

1206
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,480
very very debated right we touched upon

1207
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,159
how

1208
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,240
you know any stunt growth

1209
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:55,519
is going to negatively impact yield but

1210
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:57,358
there are some people that swear by

1211
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:59,440
topping and you know doing one top at a

1212
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:01,759
certain point and they swear that they

1213
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,240
get a bigger yield off of it what's your

1214
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,079
stance you know on on training we can

1215
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:07,759
even get into super cropping do you do

1216
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,359
any low stress training super cropping

1217
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,520
topping any type of plant training when

1218
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,838
you're growing autos

1219
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,960
so i've never super cropped

1220
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:18,480
but i used to top every single auto i

1221
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,599
grew

1222
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,318
and

1223
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,720
you know my stance really is whatever

1224
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:26,880
works for you that's my stance that's

1225
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:28,239
usually my stance on a lot of this stuff

1226
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,559
um

1227
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:31,519
i think that topping has a place

1228
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:34,159
for me

1229
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:35,119
again this stuff is subjective for me

1230
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:39,118
topping

1231
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:41,519
is is good when it's needed as far as um

1232
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,079
ceiling height maxes and stuff like that

1233
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:46,239
i started out in a two by two by four

1234
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,560
tent a four foot ceiling height in my

1235
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:50,719
opinion unless you're growing like micro

1236
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:52,559
greens is really low

1237
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:55,358
and so um

1238
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:57,679
the plants would grow up into

1239
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:58,639
dangerous areas in that light very

1240
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:00,318
easily

1241
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:01,759
when you you know if you've got a pot

1242
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:04,079
down at the bottom that's taking up a

1243
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,520
foot and then the soil level starts and

1244
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,039
then you've got to stay

1245
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:08,559
let's say you're you're you know you

1246
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:11,920
let's say your light in particular you

1247
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:13,358
need to stay at least 18 inches away um

1248
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,400
you know that only leaves you so much

1249
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:17,358
space

1250
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,200
so that's why i topped you know

1251
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:21,838
you can

1252
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:24,318
indeed top autos

1253
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:26,480
uh you can top them at whatever node you

1254
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:28,400
want the question is is it going to be

1255
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,639
beneficial for you

1256
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,318
and um

1257
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:34,960
so let's break this down into a couple

1258
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:37,039
of different categories here as far as

1259
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,679
yield

1260
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:43,358
i myself have never

1261
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:44,480
had increased yield from topping in auto

1262
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:49,039
now

1263
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:51,760
i can't say that with absolute certainty

1264
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:53,440
because like we talked about earlier i'm

1265
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,560
unable to clone

1266
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,960
an auto and do a side-by-side comparison

1267
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:02,078
you know if we could clone one

1268
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:05,039
and then have two identical plants top

1269
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,880
one not top the other grow them the same

1270
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,400
and see what happens that would be great

1271
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,000
but we don't have the benefit of doing

1272
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,519
that with autos because you can't clone

1273
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,880
them correctly

1274
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,719
so

1275
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,680
uh in my opinion

1276
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:20,559
and based off of my experience

1277
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:23,039
i don't see them giving you any giving

1278
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:26,159
me any more yield uh that could be

1279
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,759
grower error that could be my own uh

1280
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:31,199
grow techniques that could be something

1281
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:33,599
i did i'm not pumping full of uh

1282
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:35,439
of of synthetic nutrients i mean if

1283
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,838
you're in dwc

1284
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,240
um there's so many variables that could

1285
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:42,799
play into this you know but in general

1286
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:45,919
yes you can top

1287
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,440
if you're topping to get more yield

1288
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,358
that didn't work for me it doesn't work

1289
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,318
for a lot of people if some people say

1290
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:54,559
that it does work for them then maybe

1291
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:56,480
maybe that method of those people that

1292
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:59,838
it's working for is kind of where people

1293
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,400
need to flock to and build upon

1294
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:04,639
for me in my method it doesn't really

1295
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,200
produce any more yields for me

1296
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,078
so i think there are other reasons to do

1297
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,000
it

1298
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,760
so like for me ceiling height another

1299
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,159
reason to do it there's a guy on

1300
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,119
instagram named green75

1301
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:19,279
he tops and hacks and bends and ties and

1302
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:21,119
trains these things

1303
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,319
like they're just yarn you know what i

1304
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,240
mean and um he does it because he wants

1305
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:29,119
to shoot for

1306
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:31,199
all colas and not necessarily

1307
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,599
popcorn fluff and stuff all along the

1308
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:34,879
bottom um

1309
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,359
so

1310
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,519
i'm not sure it gives you more yield

1311
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:42,400
for me it didn't and for a lot of people

1312
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:44,719
i know it doesn't i prefer to just grow

1313
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,559
them naturally and do some low stress

1314
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:48,000
training i think low stress training is

1315
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,400
great

1316
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,480
it doesn't really stress the plan out

1317
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,800
and the biggest yields that i've gotten

1318
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,280
if i had to compare and i had to make a

1319
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,599
guess was from low stress training

1320
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,079
um a topped plant

1321
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:05,359
uh an untopped plant and then a low

1322
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,200
stress trained plant the lst one uh has

1323
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:08,558
i i've gotten the biggest results out of

1324
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:11,039
and that was actually just simply kind

1325
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,720
of bending the plant over almost and and

1326
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:15,119
letting it grow

1327
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:16,959
uh horizontal and letting the side

1328
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,440
branches grow up and i just ended up

1329
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,599
with these huge like just spear cola

1330
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,880
shooting out all over the place

1331
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,200
um

1332
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,119
but a lot of times these days i just let

1333
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:28,799
them grow and

1334
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,119
it's just because i'm fascinated with

1335
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,200
their natural state i do like to you

1336
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:34,720
know shave the legs so to speak and

1337
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:37,039
lollipop a little bit and get some of

1338
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:38,399
that larf on the bottom but um but for

1339
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,759
the most part i just like to let them

1340
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,880
grow but

1341
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:45,119
it's a debated topic man it is um can

1342
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,480
you top absolutely of course you can

1343
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,680
should you

1344
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:52,960
well that's like i said that depends

1345
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:57,118
solely upon your your your experience

1346
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:58,960
your goals uh your environment um

1347
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,599
all those different things that's just

1348
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,280
my subjective opinion on it though

1349
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,119
how about defoliation some people like

1350
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,800
to strip their plants basically naked to

1351
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,720
where they have just a few leaves on

1352
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:11,839
each branch are you doing any type of

1353
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:13,439
defoliation techniques on autos

1354
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:14,400
not unless they're really leafy and

1355
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,720
bushy

1356
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,039
not unless a leaf is really in the way i

1357
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:21,759
do a lot of tucking i like to tuck the

1358
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,759
leaves and get them out of the way um if

1359
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,000
it's a really really leafy plant and it

1360
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,640
just looks really wild and nuts then

1361
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,760
yeah i'll defoliate it a little bit i

1362
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:34,799
try not to do too much at one time but

1363
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:37,440
i like to just kind of

1364
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,920
give the plant

1365
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,800
what it needs to the best of my ability

1366
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,800
to

1367
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,960
get the best genetic expression out of

1368
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,880
that plant as i can that's kind of my

1369
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,400
goal gotcha

1370
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,960
a few more things that i want to get

1371
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,358
your input on so a few questions do you

1372
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,920
flush before harvest or give your plants

1373
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:58,799
a period of darkness before harvest and

1374
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,240
then along with that when do you harvest

1375
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,318
okay

1376
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:05,199
if i'm growing in it with synthetic

1377
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:06,719
nutrients then then i do flush

1378
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:08,318
um

1379
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:10,959
and but i don't really grow

1380
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:12,480
synthetically anymore so no i don't

1381
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,318
flush

1382
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,920
growing an organic sometimes the plant

1383
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:20,960
will naturally fade sometimes it won't

1384
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:23,519
as far as when i harvest i mostly pay

1385
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,440
attention to trichome development as

1386
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:27,759
well as

1387
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,318
i look for the pistols um kind of like

1388
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,720
we talked about on on my podcast i look

1389
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:34,880
for the pistols to recede kind of curl

1390
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:36,879
up and kind of want to go into the plant

1391
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,880
turn orange or brown or whatever color

1392
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,559
they turn

1393
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,039
of course i like to see the flowers

1394
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,319
themselves uh kind of fatten up a little

1395
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:46,400
bit

1396
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:47,519
and uh i pay attention to trichome

1397
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,519
development

1398
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,440
it's a really weird thing with autos in

1399
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:53,119
my experience um

1400
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,760
and i hear other people say this as well

1401
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:58,640
man it's really weird uh they don't go

1402
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:01,359
to amber trichomes a whole lot

1403
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:03,199
um if you're waiting to get like a 50 50

1404
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:06,159
you know like you do like some people

1405
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:08,558
want to go crazy like 50 50 amber cloudy

1406
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:10,000
on a photo period like autos a lot of

1407
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,000
times they won't do that you'll just be

1408
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,318
waiting around that thing's done and

1409
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,440
ready to be harvest

1410
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:19,119
so

1411
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,960
i typically just wait until i see

1412
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:22,800
growth slow

1413
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,240
sometimes though i think you said like

1414
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,119
sometimes they'll even stop kind of

1415
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:29,279
uptaking a lot of water as much as usual

1416
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,039
um i wait for those pistols and i just

1417
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,400
wait for the trichomes to be mostly

1418
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:37,679
cloudy and uh and and nice and you know

1419
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,920
milky and cloudy and uh and i wait for

1420
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:41,919
some amber usually i'll get five to ten

1421
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,000
percent and at that point i tend to

1422
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,200
harvest um that's pretty much my

1423
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,039
preferred

1424
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:48,318
area of harvest probably even with a

1425
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:49,199
photo as well

1426
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:51,440
so

1427
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:53,679
gotcha that makes sense

1428
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,559
well this could have easily been a two

1429
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:58,639
or three hour podcast episode there's a

1430
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,640
lot of things that we didn't cover maybe

1431
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:03,440
in a feature episode who knows might be

1432
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:05,279
a part two who knows yeah anytime

1433
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,200
but definitely appreciate you you coming

1434

year

1447
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:39,920
i'm just diving more into organics

1448
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:42,880
more into natural farming techniques i'm

1449
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:46,240
going to be documenting uh how

1450
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,160
to produce your own seeds at home just

1451
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:49,759
to have your own plants to grow not not

1452
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:50,558
teaching how to breed or anything like

1453
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,000
that

1454
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,680
i'm going to be

1455
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,960
just trying to share and document how to

1456
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:56,480
grow for

1457
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,119
inexpensive

1458
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,599
real cheap and use resources from around

1459
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:03,760
home and

1460
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:07,119
that's pretty much it man i'm just uh

1461
