8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,400
ingredients pumpkin seed pumpkin seed is

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,920
extremely high in phosphorus and purees

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,598

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,719
where you're trying to obtain you know a

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,520
certain temperature to break things down

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,160

you'd be surprised how just a spoonful

21
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,320
of certain things can really be

yeah i have been a hobby gardener for

110
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,598
most of my life um and

111
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,479
then

112
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:11,119
as i progressed into a variety of

113
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,199
different crops um medicinal plants

114
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,079
became sort of a focus of mine

115
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,599
and i looked for ways to um

116
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,120
you know streamline what i was doing and

117
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,199
that's really where the technique that

118
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,840
i've shared with everybody else um

119
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,840

169
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,918
tell us what is avocado tech and how did

170
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,439
you come up with it um avocado tech is

171
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,560
essentially a method of maintaining a

172
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,639
good

173
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,240
soil biology and also a manner to feed

174
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,840
plants um

175
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,918
indirectly through soil decomposition um

176
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,079
i basically came up with it uh through

177
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,560
working in my own home garden uh looking

178
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,439
for ways to streamline what i was doing

179
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,399
um

180
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:36,160
i

181
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,478
did not have a lot of infrastructure and

182
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,240
ability to uh compost during the cold

183
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:44,399
months here and i started to kind of uh

184
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,280
think to myself why can i not do this in

185
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:50,478
container and so i read more into you

186
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,758
know composting at the time and uh

187
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,839
started to come up with a way that i

188
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,160
thought that i could uh obtain what i

189
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,318
was looking for um for

190
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,400
feeding the soil and be able to do it

191
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,919
all in container and not have to you

192
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,918
know have worm bins or other

193
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,680
infrastructure that um that would have

194
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,680
been a little more cumbersome in my

195
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,598
situation so that's how it kind of

196
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,079
started and and then i kind of went down

197
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,839
on a rabbit hole um of

198
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,399
what i consider to be the fruit drop

199
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,879
theory and also the law of return

200
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,638
as far as container gardening goes and

201
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,719
basically what fruit drop theory is is

202
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,879
that you know in the natural world a

203
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,199
plant will

204
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,360
sacrifice a portion of its uh

205
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,000
reproductive nature to

206
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,479
feed itself and the soil biology to

207
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,680
maintain itself and then

208
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:37,918
the um

209
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,199
law of returns just simply kind of goes

210
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,598
hand in hand with that it's it's

211
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,680
returning a portion of what

212
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,360
has been cultivated back into the system

213
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,038
and so that it can you know

214
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,038
maintain itself for

215
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,719
the next cycle okay that makes sense now

216
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,719
can this technique be done in a

217
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,919
non-organic system for example those

218
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,319
folks that are out there using the

219
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:59,120
synthetic bottled nutrients can you use

220
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,199
avocado tech with that or um i think

221
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,120
that there are some

222
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,800
aspects of it which could benefit that

223
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,360
style of gardening if that's not my

224
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,759
focus of course um i'm more of a living

225
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,639
soil gardener but um

226
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,879
what you could probably um facilitate

227
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,478
there would be

228
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,800
bringing a little more biology into your

229
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:21,120
system and also maintaining that biology

230
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,879
source so that it continuously

231
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,160
inoculates the system

232
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,560
even though the conditions aren't

233
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,800
necessarily um you know the best for

234
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,360
that type of

235
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,200
biology when you see these videos of

236
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,639
avocado tech happening you know whether

237
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,158
it be on your instagram or there's a lot

238
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,799
of people now on youtube that are doing

239
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,639
it you know you pull out that pod

240
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,278
and it's loaded with worms and different

241
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:45,759
types of insects do you need worms and

242
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,679
or insects in order for this to work

243
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,159
um i look at them as definitely the

244
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,879
workhorse of the situation um i would

245
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:55,759
say that's a more complex or and more

246
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,799
beneficial aspect of it

247
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,958
you know

248
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,759
the real heart of it is is that you're

249
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:04,399
using microbiology to aid in

250
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,240
decomposition and

251
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,759
at the end of the day you could use

252
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,120
fungal inoculants and bacterial

253
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:11,200
inoculants too

254
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,000
to to break down

255
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,600
what you're choosing to to put into your

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,240
to put into your filling so to speak and

257
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,519
we'll get to that later

258
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,720
but worms microarthropods arthropods are

259
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,519
definitely

260
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,759
the workhorses of of the situation and

261
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,360
you will see the most um

262
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:32,879
the most complex return based on usage

263
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,720
with those guys yeah so there are

264
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,039
several different types of worms out

265
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,200
there which type of worms work best with

266
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,360
this well um

267
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,720
definitely some of the uh

268
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,159
the faster uh workhorses uh would be red

269
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,399
wigglers which a lot of people know

270
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,079
great composting worm works the surface

271
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,320
of a substrate

272
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,720
and tends to be pretty voracious

273
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,920
but i also um really like to push

274
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,600
diversity in what i do and so um using

275
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,039
european night crawlers and now i've

276
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,720
actually moved to using a little bit of

277
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,879
the african night crawlers as well in a

278
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,360
few different systems and they kind of

279
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:11,200
work different levels of the substrate

280
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,278
and they actually can even hand down um

281
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,800
material that's been worked by the other

282
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:16,320
to the next and

283
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,039
that can be really beneficial in a

284
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,920
system and and again uh the diversity of

285
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,759
the biology and and moving um you know

286
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,278
your inputs around within the soil

287
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,439
substrate is definitely accomplished

288
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,600
better when you have more workers in

289
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,399
doing that and i've even expanded to

290
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,959
beyond worms as well um

291
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,240
through sort of happenstance um things

292
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:40,000
like millipedes um even the uh the

293
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,320
woodlouse which is so controversial a

294
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,480
lot of people call them pill bugs um or

295
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,640
um isopods

296
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,278
and uh think there are organisms like

297
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,679
that which will absolutely aid in the uh

298
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:53,200
the essential digestion of of the

299
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,599
ingredients that you're adding and and

300
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,800
get them into your soil system so um i

301
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,639
would say that a a broadcast is

302
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,799
is the best way you know get it get as

303
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,958
many people as many organisms doing the

304
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,719
work for you as possible okay i've seen

305
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,719
a bunch of people do this indoors you

306
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,240
know avocado attack indoors can also be

307
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,680
done outdoors absolutely um excuse me

308
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,959
there's probably a different set of

309
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:19,039
rules involved of course outdoors you

310
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,599
don't have the control and so there's

311
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:23,360
more organisms around and they may want

312
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,278
to jump in on the party so it's very

313
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,879
important to take into consideration

314
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,439
where you're doing this what your plot

315
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,958
is like um what kind of you know flora

316
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,040
and fauna you have

317
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,119
in your area and that may or may not

318
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,120
want to take part in this uh this

319
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,720
decomposition and so there are some

320
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,879
things you can do probably the most

321
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,560
frequently asked questions are um you

322
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,958
know i have um

323
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,719
rodents or have ants or i have you know

324
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,119
some things that might excuse me be

325
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,600
opportunistic and and want to jump in on

326
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,200
the party of decomposition uh whether it

327
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,519
be just straight up eating what you've

328
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,720
put down or tampering with it and there

329
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,480
are ways to

330
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,560
to uh you know help with that i've

331
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,320
suggested flat rocks to go on top of

332
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,719
your avocado tech

333
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,720
that helps protect it i've also

334
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,839
suggested folks and i've practiced this

335
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,360
myself is

336
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,120
submerged the

337
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,159
pod as i like to call it

338
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,839
a little bit

339
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,838
more down in the soil and maybe even

340
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,680
mulch over it and that way it's just not

341
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,880
so obvious to

342
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,078
you know organisms passing by and

343
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,480
another thing would be to really

344
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,319
pre-inoculate your filling

345
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,039
with some great fungal life some

346
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,519
voracious fungal life that may uh just

347
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,278
get that work going and get it done

348
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,720
before you're you know essentially

349
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,000
putting out bait for something to

350
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,120
attract something that you may or may

351
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,240
not want

352
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,799
so it can absolutely be done um i did it

353
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,799
with success this past season uh in a

354
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,919
greenhouse that would you know doors

355
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,838
open and uh you know not really um

356
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:52,078
no other real safety measures to keep

357
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,320
things away and again with a rapid

358
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,479
decomposition i did just fine

359
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,519
okay let's get into the process a little

360
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,759
bit deeper so you know how many avocados

361
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,959
are you doing per plant or per container

362
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,838
can you talk to us a little bit about

363
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,518
that

364
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,920
sure well i mean it's probably best to

365
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,919
back track of of how i came upon this

366
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:13,039
and the regular process of learning

367
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:15,439
composting um you take note of of how

368
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:17,599
things break down in your system i've

369
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,480
done a little bit of bokashi um use

370
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,560
bokashi to do an anaerobic uh breakdown

371
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,159
of my product i've i've tried

372
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,679
thermophilic composting where you're

373
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:27,519
trying to obtain you know a certain

374
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,278
temperature to break things down but i

375
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,440
really wanted to sort of stay away from

376
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,679
both of those both of those things

377
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,279
because um you know thermophilic

378
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,638
composting can get too hot and can

379
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,519
actually be detrimental to soil

380
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,240
organisms and uh bokashi of course can

381
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,839
also be uh anaerobic which is not always

382
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,278
a bad thing but if you can avoid it

383
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:50,240
certainly um it is a good thing to do um

384
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,039
but with avocados um i noticed just

385
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,720
through

386
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,958
trial and error that my worms were

387
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,440
extremely attracted to the decomposition

388
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,359
of avocados um more so than any other

389
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,839
thing that i kind of experimented with

390
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,600
so they got me really thinking man like

391
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,920
what what is it with these guys what is

392
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,720
it with avocados and um what it really

393
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:12,159
comes down to is that uh you know fungal

394
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,040
life moves in on things uh that it likes

395
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:17,759
such as fats and lipids and avocado

396
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,159
being one of the most fattiest uh fruits

397
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,000
out there um just time and time again i

398
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,879
found that writhing ball of worms

399
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,360
forming underneath um a half an avocado

400
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:29,919
um i actually when i before i started it

401
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,680
i had half an eggplant in half and i was

402
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,838
attempting to use an eggplant and i

403
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,039
noticed that they gathered but they were

404
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,920
they they were fleeting they would

405
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,838
disappear um after a while and so

406
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,360
that led me to having the avocado and

407
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,800
putting that down and i just found that

408
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,399
that dome

409
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,479
of the shell of the avocado

410
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,320
uh kept it nice and dark and moist

411
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,959
underneath there there and it was really

412
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,760
kind of a situation that the worms loved

413
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:56,638
and so that led me towards the avocado

414
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,639
um and then beyond that um i had

415
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,600
children that were young at the time and

416
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,519
in high chairs and uh we used to sneak

417
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,079
uh you know veggies and foods that they

418
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,360
wouldn't normally eat uh to them through

419
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:11,519
pureeing them and so i got the idea of

420
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,800
mashing some of these dry amendments

421
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,919
that i would have liked to top dress

422
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:18,319
with into this uh guacamole of sorts and

423
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,559
then like a twice baked potato putting

424
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,879
it back inside and putting it down and i

425
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,479
found you know rapid decomposition of

426
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,159
that whether it be mechanical or

427
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,000
digestion through fungal life or worms

428
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,838
or whatever it may have been so it just

429
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,679
was uh it was hatched through

430
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,120
observation basically

431
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,799
and since then i want to stress that

432
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,399
there are many other domed fruits that

433
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,719
you can use

434
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,879
in place of an avocado that work just

435
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,480
fine but that avocado does have some

436
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:43,679
secret properties for sure that they

437
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,800
weren't

438
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:49,919
so do you just apply one avocado per per

439
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,919
gross cycle or multiple and when do you

440
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,360
lay those down um i really want to

441
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,078
stress that more is less so you need to

442
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,440
be cognizant of where your soil is at

443
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:59,120
i have people

444
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,480
hitting me up all the time wanting to

445
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,198
employ this

446
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,079
technique and i always my first question

447
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,000
is

448
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:08,159
you know what's your substrate how old

449
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,240
is your substrate and nine times out of

450
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,120
ten these are people with a first use

451
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,519
soil and i just want to stress that um

452
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,078
you know you should be striving to build

453
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,679
a complete soil to begin with and if

454
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,159
you're building a complete soil or

455
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,319
you're purchasing a complete soil

456
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,159
it should be fine for one cycle

457
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,240
when i like to start employing

458
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,919
avocado tech would be in the second

459
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,519
in the second cycle that's not to say

460
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,278
that you can't do it in the first cycle

461
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,839
i just think it's a little bit redundant

462
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:37,759
but people are always thinking more more

463
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,440
and more and more and so basically what

464
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,480
i like to do is

465
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,920
i use one avocado half of an avocado per

466
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,399
plant

467
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,319
i like to position it down near the

468
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,720
stock but not directly on it or touching

469
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,519
it not too close and i use a drip

470
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,480
emitter system a blue mat style system

471
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,959
that

472
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,240
drips on top of the shell of the avocado

473
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,919
maintaining the moisture and i think

474
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,000
that's really important you can obtain

475
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:04,558
the same thing by mulching it

476
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,480
or just hand watering it frequently but

477
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,879
um that's the easiest way for me because

478
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,959
i get cons consistency and what i have

479
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:16,079
done through trial and error is timed um

480
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,600
putting down one half an avocado

481
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,000
to complement

482
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,318
three parts of the plant's life cycle

483
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,720
and so basically um

484
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:27,359
i put one down in what you consider the

485
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,240
veg vegetative portion of the cycle

486
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:33,038
and i'll tailor what i fold into the

487
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,759
avocado or other dome fruit

488
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:38,640
to the vegetative cycle and then i will

489
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:41,119
i will do a second one

490
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,880
about a week or two before i want to

491
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,599
switch to

492
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,840
the flowering cycle and then i will use

493
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:51,199
a third and final one

494
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,809
about 20 days into the flowering cycle

495
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,080
um just to push um

496
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:55,440
[Music]

497
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:57,759
push the ingredients that i would like

498
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,080
to see being utilized in the soil um at

499
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,160
that time for ripening and for uh

500
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,798
finishing and flavor and secondary

501
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,400
metabolites and terpenes and oils and

502
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,558
whatever you plant you're growing you

503
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,000
know that you'd like them to to produce

504
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:11,119
make sure that that

505
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,119
those

506
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,719
ingredients are ample in the soil should

507
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,558
the plant call on them

508
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,160
okay now i know in a

509
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,399
lot of people that are in a living soil

510
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,880
system they're in larger containers

511
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,880
right you know 15 gallons is generally

512
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,320
said to be the the smallest container

513
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,240
you want to be in some people run 20

514
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,079
gallons some people are in beds what

515
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,679
container size do you suggest for this

516
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,119
and what's like the smallest container

517
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,360
that can be used for this

518
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:38,159
sure um i would say the rule of thumb

519
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:40,719
especially in living soil is the larger

520
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,759
soil container the better it just

521
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,919
there's more buffer there's um there's

522
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,919
just uh the ability to create a more

523
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,440
complex system in my opinion

524
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,559
um that being said i have uh on my

525
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,640
instagram

526
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,399
gone so far as to document containers as

527
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,120
small as two gallons

528
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,600
with the avocado tech and the reason

529
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:04,199
being is this dome fruit

530
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,918
principle can really act as a hub to

531
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,558
continuously

532
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,400
keep the inoculation that you have

533
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:11,918
you know um

534
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,240
that you've used

535
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,480
going in your system because there is

536
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,200
that moisture there is that continuous

537
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,160
uh breakdown um that you have going and

538
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,160
it can really maintain a soil system um

539
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,519
in a in quite a quite a small container

540
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,558
the only thing is again you don't have

541
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:30,160
that buffering capacity and so um you

542
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,558
know you are walking a bit of a tight

543
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,720
rope as far as you have to stay on you

544
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,918
know your moisture levels um you know

545
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,600
and you have to make sure that the

546
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,360
organisms that you're using in there

547
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,199
makes sense i mean if you're using

548
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:42,000
european night crawlers that are you

549
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,798
know

550
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,880
you know

551
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,079
six inches to a foot long

552
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,160
it's going to get crowded in a two

553
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,519
gallon container pretty quickly and

554
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,880
they're they're not going to probably be

555
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,879
very happy so

556
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,080
you need to to be smart with that and of

557
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,440
course um you know i prefer beds um

558
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:58,720
because i just feel that's the way

559
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,320
you're going to get the most complex

560
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,759
soil system going and that's the way

561
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:03,839
you're going to have the most longevity

562
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,000
with the soil system that you're trying

563
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,839
to create and and make it easier to

564
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,919
maintain the diversity basically

565
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:12,720
that makes sense now going back to the

566
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,919
actual avocado you had mentioned that

567
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,759
there's sometimes there's other

568
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,759
amendments you added to like what you

569
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,599
call i believe a mash right so what

570
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,359
other amendments are you adding to the

571
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,199
pod i know you said you tailored it to

572
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,719
the vegetation stage and then you also

573
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,640
kind of have your own thing for the

574
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,440
flowering stage can you talk to us

575
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,520
what actually that consists of sure um

576
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,440
again i mean i'm going to kind of sound

577
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,000
like a broken record in that diversity

578
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,120
diversity diversity um so

579
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,759
uh generally i don't like to

580
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,918
generally i don't like to add um

581
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,759
you know too many things but i like to

582
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,080
bring sort of a focus so in the

583
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,158
vegetative stage you're looking for

584
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,119
maybe a bump of nitrogen you're looking

585
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,280
for

586
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:56,239
you know a bump of calcium

587
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:59,119
you're looking for maybe a few gross

588
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,720
stimulants something like a kelp

589
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,399
would be a nice ingredient to use at

590
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,400
that point but that's the beautiful

591
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,559
thing about this is sky is the sky is

592
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,600
really the limit and uh utilizing soil

593
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:11,279
testing can really help you hone in on

594
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,038
exactly what you may want to add and

595
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,720
again this isn't uh you know with

596
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:17,279
organics the um

597
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,038
the the results aren't absolutely

598
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:22,480
immediate so you have to be

599
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:24,879
focusing on maybe a few weeks ahead um

600
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,640
and you know the best part of this verma

601
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,400
composting that we're doing is that once

602
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,200
these ingredients pass through the worms

603
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,280
gut

604
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,120
and some do and some do not some are

605
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,839
mechanically mixed in just by the worms

606
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,239
body moving around but um that that they

607
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,839
can be made plant available very quickly

608
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,599
um especially when you've been

609
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,000
pre-inoculated with some type type of

610
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,719
fungi and bacteria that's kind of

611
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,720
working it uh you know uh

612
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,360
pre-digesting it in a way and then the

613
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,519
worms coming through um and eating the

614
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,439
fungi bacteria and their byproducts and

615
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:58,720
sort of really making a plant plant

616
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,720
available even quicker so um i use a mix

617
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,360
and and i like to be smart and i like to

618
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,279
use um several different forms of the

619
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:09,199
same ingredients sometimes sometimes i

620
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:12,000
may use a gypsum dust for uh calcium and

621
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,080
i also may mix in a little oyster flower

622
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
um you know just to uh oyster

623
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,918
shellflower excuse me um just to give a

624
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,919
little bit of slow release so there

625
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,919
there has to be a little bit of uh

626
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,159
thinking ahead with this aspect but

627
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,320
other things i like to use malted barley

628
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,559
is fantastic because the fungal life is

629
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:30,319
really attracted to that as well

630
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,319
you can add a sugar source if you like

631
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:35,119
although i like to to really go low and

632
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,558
slow on that and we can get into why uh

633
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,199
later but

634
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:40,720
you know your molasses your agave

635
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,279
there's a lot of different

636
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,240
things that you can use to kind of

637
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,639
spur

638
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,480
the microbial life popping off a little

639
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,960
bit quicker and also to sort of feed

640
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,120
your inoculant that you choose

641
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,200
indigenous microbes are fantastic but

642
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,719
you can purchase them as well

643
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,558
there's many many varieties out there

644
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,679
that you can use but i like to use a

645
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,918
good mix of a bioinoculant

646
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,320
and then a couple targeted nutrient

647
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,960
sources so moving on to flour you would

648
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,720
maybe want a bump of a continued bump of

649
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,960
calcium that seems to be a pretty

650
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,120
consistent theme

651
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,440
and then moving into something like

652
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:18,558
phosphorus and one of my favorite

653
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,798
ingredients

654
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:22,399
is pumpkin seed pumpkin seed is

655
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,798
extremely high in phosphorus

656
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,559
and purees beautifully into almost like

657
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:29,038
a nut butter if you will and folds into

658
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:31,038
that avocado really nicely as do uh

659
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:33,679
sunflower seeds and you can get a great

660
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:34,879
bump of phosphorus you know leading into

661
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,400
when you might want to get into your

662
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,880
branching and spreading out of your

663
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,000
plants and and really setting the stage

664
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,520
for flower

665
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,038
okay now i know a lot of people are

666
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:46,158
listening to this and they have living

667
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:48,079
soil systems and they're wondering

668
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,880
is this the only thing you really need

669
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:49,839
to

670
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,840
feed

671
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,959
your system throughout the grow is it

672
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,959
can you just do an avocado and veg with

673
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,120
your your mash with your amendments

674
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,038
mixed into the pods and also same thing

675
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:02,558
in flour and then that's it or you also

676
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:04,558
doing top dressing of different

677
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,639
amendments throughout the grow well i

678
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:09,599
felt it was uh really important when i

679
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,799
was developing you know the the uh the

680
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,839
sops if you will uh for this to attempt

681
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,158
to grow

682
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:18,639
completely with um avocado tech and

683
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,000
that's kind of one of the more i'm not

684
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,559
gonna say controversial but it's a

685
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,440
little more polarizing as far as uh

686
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:27,918
people who are using it just for uh you

687
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,320
know propagation of worms and

688
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,840
maintenance of the worm population um

689
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:34,480
and even just maintenance of the

690
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:35,918
biological population of the soil and

691
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,319
then there's the other side of actually

692
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,440
completely feeding um with that and i

693
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,519
think that it's a little bit more

694
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,720
complicated when you feed solely with

695
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:47,119
avocado tech but it works fantastically

696
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,278
and i'm having results

697
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,278
that are amazing honestly with just

698
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:52,970
maintaining my system that way you'd be

699
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,400
surprised how um

700
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:56,640
[Music]

701
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,880
how just a spoonful of certain things

702
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,278
can really be sufficient to give you

703
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,720
exactly what you're looking for um in in

704
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:04,480
this type of gardening

705
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,640
yeah you mentioned that you you're in a

706
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,798
bed and from what i've heard you've been

707
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,960
in that bed for quite a long time so how

708
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:14,079
many runs have you on now in that bed

709
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:17,038
i'm on my 15th cycle right now um and i

710
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,399
have i have solely fed with avocado tech

711
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:22,240
for

712
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:24,720
at least the last eight and so um

713
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,359
i'm i'm attempting to prove improve my

714
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,798
theory now and um not only that is

715
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,079
there's there's a lot of other people

716
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:32,480
out there um

717
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:34,798
just check out the hashtag avocadotech

718
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,798
on instagram and you'll see a lot of

719
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:38,960
folks who are who are using it and and

720
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:41,359
proving the theory along with me um with

721
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,880
fantastic results it's really kind of

722
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,399
cool to see i'm not going to say that

723
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,880
there's no other maintenance involved

724
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,240
because that would be a lie but um

725
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,278
you know

726
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,079
that is the primary source of feed um

727
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:56,159
and for amending in my system yes that's

728
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,240
so awesome that's great before we move

729
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,080
on to you know auto watering mulch

730
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,319
layers cover crop you did mention that

731
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,839
you've tried other fruits as well can

732
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:05,918
you talk to us like about the other

733
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,038
fruits you've used and kind of your

734
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,080
experience

735
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,798
using them

736
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,558
sure um you know a big part of avocado

737
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:16,319
tech for me and sussing it out in my own

738
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:18,558
brain was doing research on ingredients

739
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:21,918
or on uh different fruits vegetables

740
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:25,200
nuts seeds um that were high in specific

741
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,200
nutrient profiles and so you know i was

742
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,679
i was led early on to things like

743
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,919
pumpkins um and not only in the pumpkin

744
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,559
seed but pumpkin itself because it

745
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,880
itself is a dome fruit as well so there

746
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,839
are a whole host of the curcubit family

747
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,000
which would be melons um you know squash

748
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,278
things of that nature um that that

749
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,919
worked really well and those were some

750
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:48,640
of the first ones that i experimented

751
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,200
with it after um using the avocado and

752
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,640
and part of that impetus was um

753
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,720
i wanted to move towards more

754
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,880
regenerative more restraint uh

755
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,798
sustainable ingredients that i could

756
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,520
produce myself i live in maine i'm not

757
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:04,079
in an area that can support avocados

758
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,759
and so i initially moved to try to work

759
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,519
with my grocers people that were

760
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,278
throwing away calls

761
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,519
restaurants things that were you know

762
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:13,519
places that were that had overages or

763
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,038
were not using them rather than just

764
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:16,000
going out to the store and purchasing

765
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:17,679
something

766
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,159
i wanted to reduce that carbon footprint

767
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,840
and so um i found that you know the

768
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,600
pumpkin seed works so well for me how

769
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,240
about you know working pumpkins and of

770
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:28,558
course pumpkins generally being larger

771
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,558
uh weren't my you know weren't the best

772
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:33,759
fit but since then i've i've looked at

773
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:35,599
using um little sugar pumpkins um i have

774
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:38,079
used um

775
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,759
ice particularly like spaghetti squash i

776
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,480
found that to be a fantastic source

777
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:44,720
because it has that shell that you can

778
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,440
you know that you can use time after

779
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,240
time which is really nice i've had

780
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,320
uh experimented with coconut which again

781
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,120
not not grown in this area but the husk

782
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:57,119
on a coconut the shell works fantastic

783
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:58,798
um and

784
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,398
yeah i'm trying to think of some other

785
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,839
ones i might have used

786
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:05,278
melons i'm a big fan of um cantaloupe

787
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,359
honeydew

788
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,679
i have i've tried to grow some little

789
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:12,158
mini um

790
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,759
melons this year there's musk melons

791
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,159
melons are a great source and

792
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,398
particularly good in the latter

793
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,080
stages of flowering because they are

794
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:21,839
very high in potassium and have a lot of

795
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,158
micronutrients so they can be great for

796
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:26,558
producing secondary metabolites and oils

797
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,080
and such nice nice and then i've seen

798
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:30,240
way back on your instagram i think it

799
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:33,278
was april first you started using hot

800
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,278
dogs want to talk to us

801
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,799
yeah

802
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,960
that one got me into a little bit of

803
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:41,038
trouble so that was obviously an april

804
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,240
fool's joke um

805
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:46,640
i took it a little over the top i went

806
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,880
down into my kitchen and got a uh a

807
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,840
probe thermometer um a digital probe

808
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,760
thermometer and i actually put the probe

809
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,599
into the hot dog and

810
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,359
made a little hole in the soil uh you

811
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:00,079
know before i started the video so that

812
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:03,038
it was uh you know perfectly laid trap

813
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:04,480
ready to go and i got this straight face

814
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:07,359
on and and i

815
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,839
i i did a post um you know suggesting

816
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:12,479
that i had found the uh the silver

817
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,519
bullet of uh plant nutrition

818
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,278
and uh

819
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,119
perfectly of course if you look at the

820
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:19,119
video i perfectly placed the hot dog

821
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,038
into the soil there's like you know no

822
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,278
resistance it just perfectly goes in

823
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:25,038
there and i i acted like this was some

824
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:26,558
type of instrument that i was gonna uh

825
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,640
you know measure if thermophilic

826
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,480
composting started happening and things

827
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,278
were getting too hot it would beep on a

828
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,759
timer and let me know and it was uh

829
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:38,960
the thing is i i really got a lot of

830
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,798
people hitting up my dms about actually

831
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,480
using it and

832
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:44,240
kind of probably hurt a few folks

833
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,640
feelings might explain to them that it

834
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,240
was a load of bs but

835
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,120
yeah and i thought that that's something

836
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,640
yeah

837
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,558
you got me for a second i was like wait

838
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,320
a minute is that a hot dog i was like

839
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:55,759
what is going on and then i figured it

840
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:57,439
out right as you kept on talking like

841
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:58,879
there's no way

842
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,320
i thought it was a brilliant april

843
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,600
fool's joke for sure

844
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:03,119
i mean you can't take yourself too

845
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,759
seriously man i mean at the end of the

846
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:09,519
day i'm just looking for um you know a

847
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:14,398
method to maintain um you know the soil

848
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:15,918
that is easy and uh is effective and uh

849
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,678
you know you just can't be too serious

850
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,880
about it for sure

851
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,880
so let's switch it up let's talk about

852
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,200
auto watering you mentioned that use the

853
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,520
blue mat system i also use blue mats as

854
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,840
well and i believe you're you're setting

855
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:30,079
up the carrot so it's dripping directly

856
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,158
down onto the pod so can you talk about

857
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:35,439
kind of the auto watering system how it

858
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,440
works with avocado tech sure um it is

859
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,038
definitely um one of the the keys i

860
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:44,399
think to optimize avocado tech um i i

861
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:46,558
have a greenhouse as well that i use the

862
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,719
blue soak watering system as well for

863
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:51,918
those who don't know essentially it uses

864
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,399
this um tensiometer system which is just

865
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,960
basically it senses um

866
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:59,599
the water tension in your soil um and

867
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,360
will open up a valve when uh the tension

868
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:04,000
becomes low enough and releases more

869
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:06,240
water and then as that soaks into the

870
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,440
soil the tensionometer senses it and

871
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:13,278
closes the valve and all the blue soak

872
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,120
is is it's a uh soap tape that's uh

873
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:17,119
hooked to that and so you still you're

874
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:19,439
still using the same mechanism to read

875
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:21,518
the soil moisture it's just distributing

876
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,600
it in a wider way

877
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,278
and and a little bit more passive way i

878
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:27,199
guess you would say

879
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:30,079
i use both

880
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,000
with avocado tech i do think i still

881
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:33,759
prefer the straight carrot and drip

882
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,960
system

883
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:37,119
because

884
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,798
i like the fact that it's dropping

885
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:40,639
aerated water

886
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:43,200
over this sort of dome and it's

887
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,880
cascading down and i just think you get

888
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,960
a good aeration

889
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,360
aspect to it as kind of like a secondary

890
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,640
benefit um and i think the worms really

891
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:54,000
enjoy it as well

892
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:57,360
that that said as long as you uh employ

893
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,278
the blue soak and mulch i find that you

894
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,319
get a very similar effect as long as you

895
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:04,240
nestle um you know your pod as i like to

896
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,639
call it um you know in an area where

897
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,319
there's going to be ample water and the

898
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,759
mulching just helps that facilitate that

899
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,519
whole situation

900
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:12,839
so yeah

901
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,679
it kind of

902
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:17,839
um like i said optimizes the whole setup

903
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,880
and i do feel like you can kind of

904
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:20,720
attain

905
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,278
um some results that you might not be

906
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,519
able to attain otherwise without it so i

907
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:28,000
really do recommend it okay and then for

908
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,159
mulch layer what do you typically use uh

909
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,960
well that's um constantly evolving with

910
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,600
me um that's a it's that's a topic in

911
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,159
itself honestly um i'm a big proponent

912
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:40,079
of mulching um

913
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,919
one of the main reasons is retention of

914
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:45,519
moisture in general

915
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,640
and facilitating a zone that worms will

916
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,079
like and

917
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,559
we all know that you know where do you

918
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,720
generally find worms flipping rocks

919
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:55,440
moving leaves aside they they prefer

920
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,079
dark wet areas and mulching just helps

921
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,278
to facilitate that um

922
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,759
and

923
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:03,519
you know the other thing is is that in

924
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:05,519
almost all soil systems or ones that i'm

925
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,759
familiar with at least um you know there

926
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,159
is a sort of changing of the guards as

927
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:11,919
the seasons change as far as what what

928
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,440
is acting as a mulch

929
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,840
you know

930
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,399
grasses work fantastic

931
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,798
wood chips work fantastic

932
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:23,518
i've even used mushroom

933
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,278
spent mushroom fruiting substrate

934
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,278
which could be bran it could be sawdust

935
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:29,839
it could be a lot of different things um

936
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:32,960
you know but but what i do like to do is

937
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:35,199
i like to um have it kind of ever

938
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,240
changing and um

939
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,720
that comes from generally me reusing

940
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,919
leaves and foliage from the plants that

941
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,679
i'm growing

942
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,440
mixed in with some so that would be my

943
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,600
greens and then

944
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,200
my browns might be some some mulch or

945
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:52,398
straw of

946
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,200
mulch of wood chip or straw generally um

947
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:55,839
and

948
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,000
those those seem to work really well and

949
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,720
definitely facilitate the breakdown of

950
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,319
the avocado tech aspect faster because

951
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,759
you're also a proponent of the chop and

952
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:05,678
drop method right can you can you

953
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:08,639
explain that method what that is

954
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,320
sure um essentially what i'll do is um

955
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,838
you know i

956
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,599
cover cropping is is a method of there's

957
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:16,799
several different ways to kind of do it

958
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,760
but you can get what they call

959
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,079
essentially a green manure by doing a

960
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,440
green cover crop and when you chop that

961
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,440
down

962
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,280
and then i like to then again mulch over

963
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,760
that and that will really facilitate the

964
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,240
breakdown of that green material and

965
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,919
you'll really get a nice bump of

966
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,959
nitrogen and micronutrients into your

967
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:39,118
system so um you know anybody who's into

968
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,320
living soil um certainly heard of you

969
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,559
know the clover usage of clover um vetch

970
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,639
there's a lot i mean there's a whole uh

971
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,559
list of things that would be really uh

972
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,679
beneficial dichondra is another one that

973
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:54,398
is very hot right now for people um

974
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,358
looking to to sort of have a living uh

975
00:34:54,398 --> 00:35:00,400
living mulch um i sometimes take it uh a

976
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:04,000
little step further because i'm in a

977
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,760
smaller system um and so i will use uh

978
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,559
edible plants sometimes to accomplish

979
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,119
the same thing i may do a

980
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:13,039
patty pan squash or a zucchini or

981
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,720
cucumbers or something like that that

982
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:17,039
are that are growing low and i'll time

983
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:18,639
when i seed those into my system

984
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:20,159
so that um

985
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:22,799
they they have ample light and are

986
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,639
choked out by my target crop so to speak

987
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,800
um and

988
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:29,118
that is a a great way to sort of cover

989
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,440
the bases of of getting foliage down on

990
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,920
the ground to create that moist dark

991
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,480
zone that i'm looking for so um

992
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,519
i i i will incorporate that as well um

993
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,079
so it

994
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:41,838
it's a ever-changing ever evolving thing

995
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,560
with me and i think that is part of the

996
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,559
key to my success is that um it is

997
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:49,119
changing and right now for instance my

998
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:51,920
mulch layer is wood chip um and it's

999
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:55,280
just a hard wood chip and

1000
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,440
i will then eventually seed um some

1001
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,480
companion plants into that and sort of

1002
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,920
um have it you know have it evolve again

1003
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,920
and then become a green lush kind of

1004
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,000
cover crop so i like to switch it up i

1005
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,440
think that putting in various browns and

1006
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,280
greens will just create diversity in

1007
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,639
your system that's really important

1008
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,240
yeah a lot of people don't know that you

1009
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:14,319
can actually i mean you're pruning right

1010
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:17,358
a lot of people prune their plants for

1011
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,039
air flow purposes or for defoliation for

1012
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,199
example a lot of people just throw those

1013
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:22,800
away when really they can cut them up

1014
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:24,078
and put them right down onto the top of

1015
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,160
the medium how does it use it as a

1016
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,920
multiplayer you know that'll break down

1017
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,519
and be available nutrients for the plant

1018
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,200
a lot of people don't know that

1019
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:32,960
well i think there is a little bit of a

1020
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:35,118
misconception that that could be sort of

1021
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,000
a dangerous practice and i suppose with

1022
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,760
the um you know with the uh

1023
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,400
without some checks and balances in mind

1024
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,960
it could be um people are worried about

1025
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,079
well if there's a uh if there's a fungi

1026
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,519
or a mold so to speak you know eating on

1027
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,359
this green material well then it must

1028
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:53,838
want to eat my plant and that's not

1029
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:55,679
really how it works um and and i think

1030
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:58,320
it's important to just do your research

1031
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:00,159
on on that and again the diversity helps

1032
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,920
as well you know just making sure that

1033
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:04,078
you're stacking the deck with organisms

1034
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,880
that you know to be beneficial and that

1035
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,240
really won't leave a lot of room uh or

1036
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,320
word edgewise for some of these uh bad

1037
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:14,479
organisms to to get established and get

1038
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,680
get moving in your system so that's

1039
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,358
another kind of

1040
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:18,879
key to that as well

1041
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:20,319
gotcha let's talk about environment

1042
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,200
conditions i know there's some people

1043
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,160
might

1044
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,598
think that the environment has a strong

1045
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,078
relation to it right so is there a

1046
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,359
specific environment that needs to be

1047
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,880
there in order for this to happen you

1048
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:32,960
know what should the temperature be what

1049
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,640
should the humidity be so and so forth

1050
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,800
right and that's that's actually what i

1051
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:38,639
i meant to touch on in what i was just

1052
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,800
speaking about in the last place is that

1053
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:43,118
if your environment is on point it's

1054
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,960
going to actually work with you to kind

1055
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,280
of stifle some of those those bad

1056
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,880
organisms um you want your airflow to be

1057
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,839
on point you want your temperature and

1058
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,800
humidity to be on point and you know for

1059
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:54,480
depending

1060
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,720
that entirely depends on what kind of

1061
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,000
crop is your target crop um and what

1062
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:59,679
kind of plants that you're trying to

1063
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,039
really promote and sometimes you need to

1064
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,118
straddle the line between a couple

1065
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,838
different species to make everyone happy

1066
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,320
um so you know in

1067
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:11,920
in the earlier vegetative stages i like

1068
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:14,480
to run uh more hot and wet so to speak

1069
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,960
and i'll get my temperatures

1070
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,639
up around 84 degrees

1071
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,480
and i will

1072
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:23,838
i'll go anywhere

1073
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:26,559
70 72 humidity um

1074
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:28,400
but not much up past that with very good

1075
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:30,480
airflow incorporated in that and also

1076
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,800
very good air exchange so i'm turning

1077
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,719
the air over in the space

1078
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,079
as quickly as i can

1079
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:37,838
and i think that's really important

1080
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,960
that's where i'll see the most rapid

1081
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:41,199
growth

1082
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,079
and and i like to facilitate rapid

1083
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:46,559
growth because i am a scrog or screen of

1084
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,519
green grower and i grew with a trellis

1085
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:48,400
and

1086
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:50,239
my

1087
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,639
goal there is to spread

1088
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:54,399
my canopy as far and wide as i can in as

1089
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:56,239
short amount of time as possible and

1090
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,200
what really facilitates that is higher

1091
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:01,279
temperatures and and also higher

1092
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:03,199
humidity so that's a really important

1093
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,000
component to what i do and then as

1094
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:09,199
things progress i slowly back that down

1095
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,599
into a more reasonable range um

1096
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:15,039
and i'll get into the

1097
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,960
oh it's as low and i'm talking daytime

1098
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,599
temperatures here i'm not as concerned

1099
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,960
um with the swings in temperature day

1100
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,440
and night as long as they're kind of a

1101
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,599
gradual shift i think that as with

1102
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,480
anything anything abrupt can can cause

1103
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,640
issues um but i like to do it

1104
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,639
slow and low so to speak um and i'll

1105
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,960
back into the um

1106
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:37,920
into the low 70s and i'll back my

1107
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,039
humidity uh sub 60

1108
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,760
humidity

1109
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:44,079
and again good air flow good air

1110
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,359
turnover and i never ever have any

1111
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,839
issues so

1112
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:49,519
that makes sense that's the sweet spot

1113
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:52,480
anything below 60 is really going to

1114
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:54,320
kind of stifle uh growth of of uh molds

1115
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,920
mildews and pathogens things like that

1116
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,838
yeah i mean the even the beneficial

1117
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,838
bacteria is going to slow down movement

1118
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:01,759
as the temperature gets slower and

1119
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:03,920
that'll of course slow down breakdown of

1120
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,160
the nutrients and negatively impact the

1121
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,480
plants so and that that kind of brings

1122
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:11,440
to a broader topic as well as i like to

1123
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,760
say that i'm um striving to uh instead

1124
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,559
of having a lamborghini or a ferrari as

1125
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,760
my soil i'm looking more to have a cargo

1126
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:21,759
van

1127
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,359
as as my vehicle in my soil um and i and

1128
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,960
i'm able to throttle it again with that

1129
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:28,639
temperature and humidity a little bit of

1130
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:31,519
how fast i can go but um really a slower

1131
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:33,759
more even breakdown and decomposition

1132
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:36,800
seems to be much more beneficial in

1133
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,520
staving off any kind of nutrient hunger

1134
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,880
or what i call rapid growth deficiencies

1135
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:45,199
which i grow with led lighting and

1136
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,240
you can really rev up the metabolism of

1137
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:50,799
the of your plants um

1138
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:52,239
through not only feed but environment

1139
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,800
and so i think it's really important to

1140
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:56,959
sort of have a lot of diverse tools

1141
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,800
available in the back your cargo van

1142
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,800
than it is to have your two-seater that

1143
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,880
can you know zoom but runs out of gas

1144
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,280
really fast and that's where i find a

1145
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,440
lot of people in verma composting even

1146
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,519
and in living soil run into issues with

1147
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,519
their soil becoming you know

1148
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:14,159
primarily castings and such as because

1149
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:17,280
that that engine is is revving at too

1150
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:19,279
high um a speed and the the system just

1151
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,519
can't keep up and the organisms in the

1152
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,519
system can't keep up and then in turn

1153
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:26,079
your plants can't keep up

1154
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,519
in a broad sense yeah and speaking about

1155
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,839
that you know that that's certainly a

1156
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:32,079
problem avocado attack you explained it

1157
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:33,920
seems pretty easy right just by the way

1158
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,839
explained it and you know you can put it

1159
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,358
down but people have to become across

1160
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:40,078
problems every now and then so what

1161
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:42,078
problems can people potentially come

1162
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,920
across doing this method and how can

1163
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,920
they not come across those problems in

1164
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,079
the future sure um i think there's a

1165
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,440
little bit of an intuitive aspect in it

1166
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,000
but if um

1167
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,159
that aspect eludes people there's always

1168
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,838
me and i find that i

1169
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:57,519
answer a lot of questions on a daily

1170
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:59,039
basis a lot of questions and i try to

1171
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:00,239
get to everyone

1172
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,679
and there's certain questions that i

1173
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:03,838
just kind of

1174
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:06,318
politely flatly refuse to ask and that's

1175
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:07,679
a lot of plant diagnosis but um you know

1176
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:09,679
what's this problem what's this look

1177
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:11,759
like to you what do you think this is um

1178
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:15,039
and i don't like to do diagnosis from

1179
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,520
afar because it would just be um

1180
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:19,279
it would it would be silly of me to try

1181
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,119
to do that because i can't see every

1182
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,040
factor and i really can't take the time

1183
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,880
to suss out every factor of everybody's

1184
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,838
question

1185
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,200
but

1186
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:29,119
some of the problems that i see people

1187
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,639
run into are

1188
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,559
they don't take into consideration that

1189
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:35,279
they're adding dry amendments to

1190
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:37,358
something that's moist and um in the

1191
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,319
same principle as cement you know it's a

1192
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:41,838
dry mix and you add liquid to it um the

1193
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:43,519
reverse happens as well you take

1194
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:46,159
something that's liquid and you add

1195
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:48,800
something that's a dry powder or solid

1196
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:50,159
to it and it will absorb moisture and so

1197
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,160
the problems that i've seen in some

1198
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:54,078
people's systems asking me why the worms

1199
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:56,078
aren't you know balling up underneath

1200
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,079
and congregating would be that they've

1201
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,160
added too many dry amendments and then

1202
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,480
it has pulled the moisture out of it and

1203
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:04,239
therefore is kind of

1204
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,400
messed with the texture

1205
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:08,078
and texture is important to the worms

1206
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,119
they again want an

1207
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:13,440
atmosphere that is moist and if you're

1208
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,119
kind of mixing up a dry quick cement um

1209
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,960
it's going to get pretty unappetizing to

1210
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,640
them not to say that it won't break down

1211
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,400
over time and not to say that the fungal

1212
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:23,039
element won't move in and break it down

1213
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,280
over time but it just won't be that that

1214
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:27,519
seamless breakdown and that really you

1215
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,680
know sort of um dynamic situation going

1216
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:32,159
on underneath your pod so mainly it's

1217
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:34,078
been that um the only other thing i can

1218
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:35,679
think of is that um

1219
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,640
people have

1220
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:38,239
um

1221
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:39,598
i haven't seen any problems arise from

1222
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:40,799
it but i've had people say that they've

1223
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,200
had pods that they thought weren't

1224
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,200
anaerobic because the aromas the smells

1225
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:47,279
um that were coming from it were not

1226
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:49,519
necessarily appetizing and one thing i

1227
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,000
explained to them is decomposition is

1228
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:53,519
not built for you know

1229
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,838
the human nose to be pleasant

1230
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:58,480
decomposition you know can put off all

1231
00:43:55,838 --> 00:44:00,960
kinds of of aromas that might not be

1232
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,119
your favorite um and that's why i really

1233
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,760
suggest for people um to use something

1234
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,240
like a bokashi which has the the

1235
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,680
particular microorganisms that will deal

1236
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:13,919
with uh with a anaerobic or

1237
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:15,679
aerobic kind of situation underneath the

1238
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,318
pod and can really help break things

1239
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:20,159
down and and you won't see anything um

1240
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:22,559
you know too detrimental in your system

1241
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:24,559
so never seen anything that's that's

1242
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:27,279
been a big problem other than it's sort

1243
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:30,239
of not living up to uh the standards

1244
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,240
that i show on uh on social media that's

1245
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:34,239
good to know what advice do you have for

1246
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:36,000
growers who are just getting started

1247
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:37,519
with avocado tech techno i know you went

1248
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,559
over so much advice throughout this

1249
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:40,880
video is there anything else that you

1250
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,960
can think of one would be um you know

1251
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,119
take it take it slow

1252
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,199
the avocado in itself

1253
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,559
is perfect feed

1254
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:52,719
there really is no reason to load it

1255
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:55,440
with everything but the kitchen sink i

1256
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:57,598
mean it's a beautiful um

1257
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,920
feed when it breaks down by itself and

1258
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:02,000
so if you have a young system a system

1259
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,960
that's not particularly mature just have

1260
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,400
an avocado take a fork mix it up and

1261
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,318
again use a ripe or rotting avocado i

1262
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,000
love to let it sit out until it rots you

1263
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:14,800
get some free microorganisms already

1264
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,079
working on that thing and you can really

1265
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,839
um

1266
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,160
you can really still benefit your system

1267
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:22,318
just using a plain avocado so i would

1268
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:24,480
say that's the way to start you know

1269
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:27,279
there's no real investment other than

1270
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,358
obtaining that that fruit and uh

1271
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,960
and giving it a try and then after that

1272
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:32,639
you know

1273
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,039
use the amendments that you decide to

1274
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:37,440
add in sparingly i think that you would

1275
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:38,880
be shocked how much a teaspoon or

1276
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,800
tablespoon of some of these dry

1277
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,039
amendments can really influence your

1278
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,800
soil system and again when it's right

1279
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,719
underneath that plant you know you're

1280
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,960
really targeting that one plant in that

1281
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:51,039
system um in that rhizosphere where all

1282
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,720
that biological interaction is going on

1283
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:54,239
right there next to your roots and

1284
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,239
that's the really the most important

1285
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:59,199
part uh in place where you want to have

1286
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:00,799
that go on awesome so wrapping things up

1287
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:02,639
how can listeners find you and what do

1288
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,800
you have upcoming in the future uh you

1289
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:07,838
can definitely find me on instagram um

1290
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,720
instagram is where i do um you know

1291
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:12,719
most of my educational aspect of what i

1292
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:15,759
do and also just kind of broadly showing

1293
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:16,639
you what i'm up to um and so that is the

1294
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,599
at

1295
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:22,078
blue underscore of underscore green tank

1296
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,039
one word um and you can always search

1297
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,800
avocad

1298
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,719
avocado tech

1299
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,560
and that will bring you to most of my

1300
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:30,399
posts

1301
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:31,920
have that attached to it as well as many

1302
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,440
other growers that have that attached to

1303
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,599
it

1304
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,480
what i have coming up in the future is

1305
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:42,079
um my new business venture is

1306
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:46,240
mary stem llc and that is an adult use

1307
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:48,400
retail shop and my um my aim is to

1308
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,159
um not only work with some of the best

1309
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,400
and brightest farmers here in maine and

1310
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:55,039
showcase what their potential is um but

1311
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,200
i would like to parlay that into a small

1312
00:46:55,039 --> 00:47:00,880
house brand of my own um which will

1313
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:02,639
utilize avocado tech to feed um you know

1314
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,079
some of the plants that i will uh

1315
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:06,000
hopefully be able to get into the adult

1316
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,079
use market in the future that's exciting

1317
