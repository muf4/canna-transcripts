1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,448
what's up everybody feel that don't know

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,250
me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:08,009
you're watching my extra channel this is

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,419
the vibe Osun 315 watts EMH grow light

5
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:11,759
and in this video I'm going to do a

6
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:14,548
power test I'm going to use the apogee

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,969
MQ 500 power meter this meter measures

8
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:20,789
from 389 nanometers to 692 nanometers

9
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:23,698
plus or minus five dianna meters and the

10
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,050
measurements are in ppfd I'm just doing

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,420
this we can get a general idea of what

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,219
the power output is it's not going to be

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,689
hundred percent accurate measurements

14
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:32,488
are taken in a grow tent so the

15
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,980
reflective material could increase the

16
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:37,199
power output so keep that in mind also

17
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:39,119
this light has a flowering coverage area

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,950
of three foot by three foot and this is

19
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,449
a four foot by four foot grow tent so

20
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,040
I'm not going to be going all the way to

21
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,690
the corner of the grow tent I'm going to

22
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,308
try to keep it in a three foot by three

23
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:48,179
foot space I'm going to take

24
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:51,689
measurements at three different

25
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:53,429
distances 12 inches 24 inches and 36

26
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:56,459
inches these are pretty standard

27
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:58,170
distances for CMH grow lights just like

28
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,170
all the other parts as videos I do I

29
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:45,359
will let the measurements do the talking

30
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:45,359

35
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:02,969
what do you think about these

36
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,830
measurements let me know in the comments

37
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:07,259
section below a link to this girl light

38
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,420
is in the description section below I do

39
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:11,609
have more PARCC test videos coming out

40
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:13,859
here soon which one do you want to see

41
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,709
next I have the green sunshine company's

42
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,690
es 300 the solar extreme 500 by

43
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:21,629
California light works and I also have

44
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:22,949
the Sun system 315 watt CMH grow light

45
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:24,299
that's pretty much it for this video

46
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:25,829
guys if you enjoyed it please click that

47
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,010
thumbs up and that we'll leave it at

48
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,440
that

49
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:31,639
thank you so much for watching and until

50
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:31,639
next time face

51
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,890
you
