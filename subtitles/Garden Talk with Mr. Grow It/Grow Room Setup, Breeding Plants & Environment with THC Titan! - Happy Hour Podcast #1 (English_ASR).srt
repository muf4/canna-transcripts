1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,919
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,600
know me my name is chris aka mr growit

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,040
and i'm back with another video got

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:07,679
something a little bit different for you

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,280
today

6
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,199
in this episode we're going to talk to

7
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,279
thc titan i say we

8
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,279
because it's not just me chris from

9
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,960
happy hydro is also joining me on this

10
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,320
and full disclosure this is an old

11
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,118
episode it was actually

12
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,800
filmed a couple years back it was on a

13
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,000
different youtube channel that youtube

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,519
channel got deleted

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,599
and there's some really good information

16
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,358
in this so i figured a re-release would

17
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,399
be worthy so this is actually an episode

18
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,640
from a podcast

19
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,119
the podcast was called happy hour and uh

20
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,000
the host is chris from happy hydro

21
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,399
i was the co-host um i don't speak very

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,238
much

23
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,000
in the episode this is more of like an

24
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,238
interview with thc titan

25
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,159
the topics that we cover is grow room

26
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,119
setup we also talk a little bit about

27
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,479
breeding

28
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,079
and then we finish off the episode

29
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,119
talking about environment and like i

30
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,679
mentioned this was

31
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,759
filmed a couple years back so i'm sure

32
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,399
thc titans grow room setup

33
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,320
is different now head on over to his

34
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,239
channel you can see his most up-to-date

35
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,840
setup this is actually the first episode

36
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,079
of the podcast so

37
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,118
it's a little bit all over the place as

38
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,359
far as flow

39
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,478
also for the first five minutes when thc

40
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,400
titan is talking

41
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,319
it's kind of like cutting in and out

42
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,880
hanging there it's just for

43
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,359
five minutes it's super annoying yes but

44
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,640
um

45
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,040
if you can get through that first five

46
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,159
minutes it's clear from there on out i

47
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,600
actually have three more of these

48
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,118
podcast episodes

49
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,359
this one that you're about to watch is

50
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,840
really just audio only

51
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,000
the other three that i have i believe

52
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,240
two out of three i have video as well

53
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,519
so if i do end up releasing those i will

54
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,359
include the video as well

55
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,519

talk to you about your grow methods and

66
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,560
some of the equipment you use

67
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:03,359
and um i guess where we would like to

68
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,840
begin

69
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,200
is pretend you're walking into your grow

70
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,800
room can you kind of like tell me what

71
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,840
you see and like

72
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,080
how your setup goes yeah sure so

73
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,080
romney watkins let's see have it's

74
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,360
basically a 15 by 12

75
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,480
uh and i have two

76
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,599
just wings nearest me air conditioner

77
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,840
about 15 000 btu three

78
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,519
air cooled double ended hoods so i'm

79
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,319
running all double landed in the room

80
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,120
and

81
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,119
basically i run like a scrog screen or

82
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,400
green style

83
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,920
the trellis is only there for the

84
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,599
support but it looks you know like a

85
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,039
traditional scrog but

86
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,280
you'll see some top shoot up here and

87
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,878
there but yeah so and then i have a

88
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,719
walkway in the middle but

89
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,120
flowers just gonna be a sea of green

90
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:52,159
that's all you're really gonna see in

91
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,039
it's pretty nice 5000

92
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,400
watts right now and very soon to some

93
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,359
around 6 000.

94
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,120
damn dude that sounds pretty legit um i

95
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,640
looked at your video and i saw that you

96
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,840
have a carbon filter

97
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:08,799
and a fan mounted in the room

98
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,319
yeah um is that constantly exhausting

99
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,239
like while your air conditioner is

100
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:15,119
running like does it does it

101
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,959
exhaust some of your cold air yeah i

102
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,360
have it set to a

103
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,560
zephyr 3 controller by titan controls i

104
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,680
believe and it's

105
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,920
it has a temperature set point so

106
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,239
and it will dial up and dial down based

107
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,158
on what you set it at so you set it like

108
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,719
95 and that's 100

109
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,439
and then you set your low end like 63

110
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,080
and then that's

111
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,519
zero percent so as it gets closer and

112
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,760
closer to

113
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,680
that warmer range you'll slowly ramp up

114
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,679
so i would say when i'm running

115
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,439
my 81 degrees i usually run i would say

116
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,519
it's running at about

117
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,479
forty percent maximum so just barely

118
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,200
like

119
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,280
it can't be that's awesome dude

120
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:56,079
extremely well

121
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,680
yeah and that controller is pretty legit

122
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,040
is that an expensive controller i mean

123
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,400
it sounds like pretty legit

124
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:05,039
up like 90 dollars

125
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,480
pretty cheap actually you know

126
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,919
considering for what it does

127
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:12,158
it's basically just a sensor on a

128
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,518
little uh so it's not sitting you know

129
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,039
like against the wall or

130
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,280
down on the floor so you can kind of put

131
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,599
it out in your hottest point

132
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,119
so it's not like the the it doesn't

133
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,840
monitor your co2 or do you use co2

134
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,120
yeah i run co2 at just above uh ambient

135
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,198
at like 700

136
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,560
parts per million so nothing crazy

137
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,680
usually in the 700 to

138
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,478
900 range so just enough to keep it up

139
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,639
above and

140
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,918
to a point where i'm not um expending a

141
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,319
lot you know on

142
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,719
gas because it can get expensive if

143
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,560
you're just

144
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,120
exhausting it out of the room in that

145
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,918
manner

146
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,680
but this this way it's slowly pulling it

147
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:50,799
across canada i go through them every

148
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,199
two weeks

149
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,400
which is not that bad oh you set a tank

150
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,199
every two weeks

151
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,599
yeah oh yes that isn't too bad and have

152
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,360
you ever

153
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,000
like done a side-by-side or an

154
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,280
experiment where you've ran 700 ppms and

155
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
then like 1200

156
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,879
or well i've been running co2 for about

157
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,519
a year now

158
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,000
so i've been slowly working my way up i

159
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,959
started

160
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,279
around uh 500 at up to 900 so i'm only

161
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,758
increasing it 100 at a time so i can

162
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,519
kind of see the results and

163
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,639
right now the 900 seems like a sweet

164
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:27,680
spot because i have a burner so

165
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,199
uh turn on when the ambient co2 gets

166
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,439
below the setpoint

167
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,160
and uh when it when it's turning on too

168
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:36,719
often for me my temperature gets

169
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,520
a little bit too high so this would be a

170
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,080
sweet spot

171
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,599
for me and my next my next girl will be

172
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,639
fully sealed so the burner won't have to

173
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,000
turn on

174
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,079
as often that's awesome dude i um

175
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,319
your your air conditioner now is that

176
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:53,279
like a mini split

177
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,918
the air conditioner is just a uh

178
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,279
portable

179
00:05:53,918 --> 00:06:00,478
dual hose uh or just

180
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,918
from home depot um the hose

181
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,758
gets exhausted the hot air gets

182
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,359
exhausted to the attic and in the attic

183
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,360
i have

184
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,038
this filter and then it pulls all the

185
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,240
hot air from the attic and then exhausts

186
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,560
it outside

187
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,720
so how does that build up a carbon

188
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,000
filter in the attic did you say

189
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,000
8 inch fan for fans are you buying like

190
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,918
the most expensive can fan or you're

191
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,759
just using like regular eight inch fans

192
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,000
from amazon or ebay

193
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,120
well typically i like the max fans i've

194
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,199
had nothing but

195
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,240
reliability from then and you know in

196
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,079
their can fans but

197
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,280
uh the cheapest fan i can get only

198
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,800
because i know it's gonna be running at

199
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,799
a very high temperature

200
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,879
and it's probably gonna die sooner than

201
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,280
later i give it a life expectancy of

202
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,079
about

203
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,439
six months to be honest because all that

204
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,478
hot air running through that fan is

205
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,000
gonna break down any

206
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,719
electronical component or motor

207
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,319
components over time

208
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,639
then you said it was a max fan that

209
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,439
you're using or no

210
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,400
it's a uh value line just gotcha that's

211
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,918
what i could find

212
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,839
yeah because you knew that you were

213
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,918
gonna be beaten on it

214
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,399
yeah i knew it was eventually it's gonna

215
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,560
you know the motor is gonna overheat

216
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,239
yeah max fans have been extremely

217
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,038
reliable for me that my 10 inch one that

218
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,478
i have

219
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,719
i've had for about five years now

220
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,199
running almost

221
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,000
constantly so it's really really really

222
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,879
reliable

223
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,319
and do they have different uh size

224
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,959
models like do they have six inch eight

225
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,000
inch

226
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:27,279
so on and so forth yeah six to uh

227
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,959
12 for their um for the style that i

228
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,918
have i forgot what they call it but like

229
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,758
their max fan i think it is i got a

230
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,918
buddy who has a max fan who's who he's

231
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,479
had after like five or six years too and

232
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,598
still running like a champ what kind of

233
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:41,918
medium are you growing in are you

234
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:45,120
growing in pots or

235
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,839
cocoa yeah uh i grow my flower rooms

236
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,879
typically

237
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:51,359
number 10 containers with pure cocoa

238
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,879
i've tried a few different brands um

239
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,080
some of them i don't like i've had bad

240
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,759
experience with

241
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,038
like i don't know i don't want to say

242
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,080
anything bad about companies but

243
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,478
basically

244
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,120
the best cook i've ever tried is either

245
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,120
um

246
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:08,319
kiana coco or uh cloud core

247
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,360
charcoal cocoa always great results from

248
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,199
both of those

249
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,038
and do you hand water or do you set up a

250
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,720
drip or something

251
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,719
i'm hand watering currently but this

252
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,160
next round i should have the floor flex

253
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,479
installed and i'll have it

254
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,080
set up on automatic watering which will

255
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:23,519
be nice kind of document and show

256
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,079
everybody how to do it

257
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,439
if they're interested yeah that's sweet

258
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,719
you'll be showing that on your youtube

259
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:31,199
channel

260
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,919
yeah for sure thc titan is the channel

261
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,440
everybody

262
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:37,759
um i have never seen these what

263
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,760
floral flags you said yeah the floor

264
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,000
flex is like an octa bubbler system if

265
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,439
you're familiar with those so basically

266
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,958
they built it usually you have to build

267
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,640
them on your own it only comes with the

268
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,599
head but the floor flex comes fully

269
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,600
built out

270
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,200
and all you do is basically glue it into

271
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,200
your pvc and

272
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,959
plug in your hoses and you're good to go

273
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,000
and he even has an adjustable valve on

274
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,799
it so

275
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,360
you can adjust each eight sight you know

276
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,399
pressure

277
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,919
uh based on what you like which will

278
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,360
work out great for me because i have on

279
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,278
one side i have smaller plants on the

280
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,720
other side of bigger plants so

281
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,399
i'm going to set up the floor flex you

282
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,519
know accordingly and adjust the pressure

283
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,839
from there

284
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,440
and that so that's that's not a hydro

285
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,560
system it's just a watering system for

286
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,880
the cocoa

287
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,399
a drip system yeah correct drip system

288
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,639
gotcha yeah i'll have to check that out

289
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,799
after the show do you

290
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,080
so is your are you on like a concrete

291
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,838
floor or anything do you

292
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,440
have to keep your plants off the ground

293
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,560
or

294
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,959
um so where i'm growing is basically a a

295
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,958
home

296
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,719
that i've basically blown out you know

297
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,599
into

298
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,639
a uh a girl house you know like you know

299
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,240
and then

300
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,559
so i have my main flower room which is

301
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,399
uh carpeted and then two layers of

302
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,838
uh panda film on top and so

303
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,559
i don't have to worry about any kind of

304
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,800
like um root damage from temperature and

305
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,879
whatnot

306
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,000
yes i've uh i know a lot of people have

307
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,439
dealt with that like growing in

308
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,720
basements and just putting the plants on

309
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,839
the floor and not really knowing what

310
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,519
they're doing

311
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,360
and then having the cold temperatures

312
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,278
from the floor uh screw up the roots

313
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,399
yeah especially if you have like cloth

314
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:12,078
pots it's like

315
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,440
just magnified even more intensely

316
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,120
because there's not that

317
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,680
plastic barrier in between i had an

318
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,600
issue with that in my

319
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:20,879
i had to grow with a partner and it's

320
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,680
probably on my youtube channel like one

321
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,639
of my first

322
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,199
two three videos uploaded um and it has

323
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,759
the

324
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,959
concrete floors and uh we were getting

325
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,360
solar growth and we didn't have

326
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,958
any kind of uh barrier in between the

327
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,120
concrete and then later like four months

328
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,239
later i finally realized oh my gosh

329
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,320
you know when it's winter why does

330
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,560
everything slow down well that's why

331
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,200
it's cold concrete the fact that you

332
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:45,119
were able to pinpoint that problem

333
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,879
i mean a lot of people just might never

334
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,759
figure that out like did you switch the

335
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,320
plastic

336
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,000
pots after that or yeah actually we did

337
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,120
yeah we switched to number 10s bigger

338
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,278
pots and

339
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,159
i was like oh it's just the bigger pots

340
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:58,320
no

341
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,919
yeah it turns out that you know because

342
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,800
we adjusted everything we turned down

343
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,199
our

344
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,879
you know got our environment dialed in

345
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,839
you know dehumidifiers and everything

346
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,360
and whatnot and

347
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,440
the growth still wasn't picking up like

348
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,278
it should have but then we switched

349
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,360
we ran a few tesla plants in number 10s

350
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:14,559
and the growth was way better like wow

351
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,000
it must be

352
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,599
the medium because it was a little bit

353
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,958
more medium like two more gallons worth

354
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,200
of medium but

355
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:24,078
yeah then later i connected connected

356
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,600
the two so almost stumbled upon it

357
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,199
and are the number 10s are those 10

358
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,639
gallon pots

359
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,480
they're just below 10 gallon gotcha

360
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,159
what are you using for nutrient lineup

361
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,200
and additives

362
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:38,719
so nutrients uh i kind of run whatever

363
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,959
basically to be honest with you

364
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,320
nutrients really aren't that important

365
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,359
in my eyes

366
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,879
um last round i ran nectar for the gods

367
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,879
ran their whole line and

368
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,278
got pretty good results i was happy with

369
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:54,159
it but the uh the amount of work and

370
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:56,078
just the overall cleanliness of it i'm

371
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:56,639
not really a fan of even though it isn't

372
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:58,719
all

373
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,278
or ninety something eight percent

374
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,320
organic but from the earth basically

375
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:06,480
uh line i i like that you know that's

376
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,839
that's nice but i'm not outdoor so i'm

377
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,560
not really worried about runoff and

378
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,440
adding

379
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,518
uh salts i guess you would say chemicals

380
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,839
as most people would say to the

381
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,120
to the ecosystem so i'm going to go back

382
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,120
to uh just a micro and bloom base and

383
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,039
probably a few organic additives added

384
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,360
in so you said it's not

385
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,799
nutrients aren't really important to you

386
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,919
what what's your thought process behind

387
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,000
that

388
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:31,599
because i've ran through so many

389
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,879
nutrient lines i mean

390
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,320
from canna to gh dry

391
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:41,679
powder to gh liquid nectar for the gods

392
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:45,200
biobiz um house and garden

393
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,199
i've i've ran so many and

394
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,879
advanced i use their big bud in

395
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,519
overdrive in the past i have not used

396
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,039
any of their bases because usually all

397
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,959
the bases are pretty similar when

398
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,159
they're in a liquid form unless they're

399
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,159
organic then they start to get

400
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,600
proprietary

401
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,879
so basically all these nutrient lines

402
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,278
out there you're saying are basically

403
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:05,679
very very similar to the fact where

404
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,278
yeah yeah based off of my experience and

405
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,679
what i've seen the nutrients

406
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:10,958
don't have that much impact i'd say the

407
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:13,599
environment

408
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:15,679
and just the grower's eye is way more

409
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,399
important along with genetics

410
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,199
what about flavor flavor i ran the

411
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,399
nectar

412
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,000
this round and i mean

413
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,519
the flavor i mean the only thing i've

414
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,519
noticed is that it cures a little bit

415
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,399
faster it's easier to get to

416
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,600
that point of smooth smoke if that makes

417
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,078
any sense

418
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,278
gotcha so many plants are you growing in

419
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,078
your operation

420
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:40,159
i have uh 15 and flower and then the

421
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,559
rest uh

422
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,159
are up and down you know based on need

423
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,719
you must be growing some monster plants

424
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,679
to cover

425
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,879
5 000 watts with 15 plants oh yeah

426
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,359
they're pretty big usually

427
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:54,320
the typical yield if it's not a cookie

428
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,800
strain it's a half pound per plant

429
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,440
damn how many plants per light then if

430
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,198
you could bring

431
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,920
it down for me two two to three

432
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,479
two three gotcha along those lines some

433
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:06,799
are bigger

434
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,879
some are smaller anything you'd like to

435
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:12,000
change uh that you haven't tried yet

436
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,559
in your setup um i really want to try

437
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
out

438
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:18,078
led lighting so i did grab another

439
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
light from uh pacific light concepts to

440
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,919
try out their led

441
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,120
um you can see how that that works

442
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,198
because uh

443
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,639
she grows thanks she you'll see a few of

444
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,359
her videos on my channel she has like a

445
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,079
four by four ten she has all of the

446
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,278
uh cree cobs the chip on board lights in

447
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:36,078
her tent and i've been

448
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:38,240
blown away by the results for uh low

449
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,319
wattage 600 watts is putting out like

450
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,759
you know a thousand watts could and

451
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,440
i've noticed that she can run a little

452
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,679
bit higher temperature and

453
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,959
still get really really good quality oh

454
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,198
this citizen i have

455
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,799
the citizen cops also running in a

456
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,879
little two by four closet it's kind of

457
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:56,078
like my little test area for

458
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:59,120
new incoming strains new genetics that i

459
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,879
test out and uh confirm myself and that

460
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,959
thing has been performing just as well

461
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:05,838
as the the creek hops and it's about

462
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,679
half the price i think so you're saying

463
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,519
you do you test out all strains in a

464
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,559
little small area before you go to a big

465
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,959
room

466
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:17,278
um most of them yeah i with the uh

467
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,559
the genetics you don't you know all new

468
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,159
genetics you don't really know what

469
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:23,599
you're gonna get you know so

470
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:26,159
for me it's important to uh verify the

471
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,199
quality on my own see it firsthand and

472
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,719
and i have a 2x4 closet that's just set

473
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:34,078
up with a little 200 watt

474
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,120
um citizen cob light and then i have

475
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:39,120
the the shegros dank tent which is a 4x4

476
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,159
and we do testing there before they make

477
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,799
it to

478
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,159
full more more full production in the

479
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,519
the bigger flower

480
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,519
yeah i mean it seems like the smart

481
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,240
thing to do

482
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,839
now i know you also do some breeding as

483
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,839
well right

484
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,120
yeah right yeah square one genetics

485
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,279
before we get into all that

486
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,879
actually just kind of a basic question

487
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,078
how did you first get into growing and

488
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,600
then maybe after

489
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,359
you know you kind of answer that then we

490
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,399
can kind of get into the the whole

491
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,639
breeding thing

492
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,480
so i first got in a very young age i had

493
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,360
cousins who were a lot older than me

494
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,440
like about four years and uh

495
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,519
so they had more readily available

496
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,360
access i guess to it and

497
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,720
so i just hang out hung out with them

498
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,919
and you know smoked

499
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,360
my first time and uh i liked it and then

500
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,120
uh

501
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,839
i took i don't know i stopped smoking

502
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,560
for i don't know some around eight

503
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,079
years and then i started smoking again

504
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,559
and

505
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,439
i was just wasn't happy with the product

506
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,599
it was very

507
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,560
in inconsistent i never knew what i was

508
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,399
going to get it was like playing the

509
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:45,758
lottery every single time and

510
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,519
that gets real real real fast and so

511
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,879
i said i'm going to grow my own you know

512
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,078
i'm going to do it on my own so i

513
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:53,439
started with a little

514
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:56,719
400 watt ceramic metal halide and an

515
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,600
attic and uh

516
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,040
some pineapple express that was my first

517
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,480
successful grill completed

518
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,318
all the way through was pineapple

519
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,519
express because who doesn't love that

520
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,038
movie that's one of my all-time

521
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,400
favorites to be honest

522
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:12,640
and then yeah flowered that out and

523
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,240
just kept expanding slowly from there

524
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,400
you know one night at a time

525
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,359
reinvesting so how many years have you

526
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,480
been growing now

527
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:23,599
uh over seven now consistently

528
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,318
back to back no no gaps just do you have

529
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,038
a job too

530
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,000
or is it just strictly growing i used i

531
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,240
used to work

532
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,079
12-hour days i used to have work like

533
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,558
six days a week 12 hour days but

534
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,599
and then i knew eventually that if i

535
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,558
just kept going

536
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,678
and uh kept pushing that eventually i

537
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,200
wouldn't have to work anymore and

538
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,880
eventually i got to the point where i

539
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,519
saved enough money where i could say i

540
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,640
quit

541
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:47,279
and so know i left i grow on my own

542
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,880
that's all

543
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,558
you're now you're living the american

544
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,280
dream bro yeah

545
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,960
appreciate it that's awesome so now

546
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:58,240
you're focused a lot on

547
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,519
um breeding and creating your own

548
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,880
genetics and stuff like that is that

549
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:01,679
correct can kind of tell us a little bit

550
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,799
about that

551
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,480
yeah so the breeding i i i had a few

552
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,679
crosses that i did in the past

553
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,640
um just for my own personal like some

554
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,160
cam dog double diesel cross with like a

555
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,559
blueberry strain

556
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,919
but that was about two years three years

557
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:19,678
into my growing career and then

558
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,919
i wasn't taking it seriously at all and

559
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,440
then now i

560
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,600
the same kind of thing i was getting

561
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,279
genetics that in clones that i wasn't

562
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,798
really happy with you know it was a crap

563
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,480
shoot when i try to get a clone that's

564
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:32,000
labeled cookies and it looks like blue

565
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,240
dream you know what i mean

566
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,839
i not unacceptable in my eyes and so

567
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,839
really with me it's about having

568
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:43,038
verifiable

569
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:46,558
solid uh genetics and

570
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:48,319
now you know it this is like the perfect

571
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,160
opportunity for somebody who

572
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,759
is interested in seeds to get them

573
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,519
because they can literally see it

574
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,279
grown right in front of them and then

575
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,759
you know you know exactly what you're

576
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,519
getting which is what i always wanted

577
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,038
to have a good uh handle of what i'm

578
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,160
dealing with and that is

579
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,440
super legit and especially like being

580
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,720
i'm on the east coast i'm in new york

581
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,360
dude i've seen

582
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,000
people will call anything a cookie

583
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,159
strain

584
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,599
that they have it's just everything's

585
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,360
cookies like

586
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,439
so what you're doing is pretty sweet

587
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,519
it's uh definitely adding value to

588
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,200
the growing community by providing like

589
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:22,960
good genetics like you're basically

590
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,759
going to show everybody what you're

591
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,038
growing on your youtube channel and then

592
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:31,679
yeah you can see any strain that has

593
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,720
i have ever released you can see on my

594
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,480
channel or

595
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,400
many pictures of it uh through the

596
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,319
instagram account as well so it's all

597
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,400
verified and it's all there for you

598
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,319
do you like throw down like your grams

599
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,600
per watt and stuff like that for people

600
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,960
like the size like

601
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,798
i don't know you see that type of stuff

602
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,558
and you're looking for seeds sometimes

603
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,519
um no because the phenotype of variation

604
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:53,359
is

605
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,599
hard it's hard to tell you know you you

606
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,439
can get a big yielding cookie fino

607
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:58,879
but you might have to hunt through 30

608
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,120
seeds to find that pheno or you might

609
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,480
get lucky and get it in only a five pack

610
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:06,158
you know

611
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,919
gotcha because they are f1 uh generation

612
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,799
it's just next level [ __ ] that's over my

613
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,799
head almost man

614
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,480
where are we at mr growit uh so we want

615
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,558
to find out what the biggest yield is

616
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,159
today and you know how much juice were

617
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:23,678
you running at the time

618
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:27,600
biggest yield today uh let's see

619
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:30,720
i think my biggest yield was like 9.87

620
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:33,599
pounds from uh the five

621
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,079
the five lights wow which is which is

622
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,240
it's it's

623
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,199
okay you know some some people these

624
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,000
days are claiming

625
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,440
over three so i mean whatever magic

626
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,079
juice they're feeding to their plants i

627
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,200
want some

628
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,199
i know it's not mammoth pee

629
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,678
oh [ __ ] we love you mammoth speed don't

630
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,360
take it too bad

631
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,440
so five thousand when you get this right

632
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,798
the 5 000 watts

633
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,640
basically you're saying you had lighting

634
00:20:54,798 --> 00:21:00,798
and you got over nine pounds

635
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,520
yeah 9.87 uh 9.9 fully manicured trim

636
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,158
tried

637
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,119
nice ready to go it's legit man that's

638
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,880
that's wild

639
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,879
what was your uh what was your biggest

640
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,320
catastrophe in growing

641
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,600
biggest catastrophe oh man um

642
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:19,119
powdery powdery mildew and light flower

643
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:22,319
and with my partner we had a

644
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:25,119
a grow like a big bigger garage grow

645
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,319
like i said it's on my youtube um but

646
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:27,678
yeah we had a bigger grow and then

647
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,879
layton flower

648
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,480
powdery mildew was showing up and little

649
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,000
you know it looked like powdered sugar

650
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,880
at first i know what it was because i

651
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,240
was still new

652
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,039
newish to growing and identified it and

653
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,200
all we could do was do a hard leaf strip

654
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,640
it was about day 56 of flowers so we

655
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,000
were really close to being done so we

656
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,200
did a hard

657
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,960
uh leaf strip and uh wiped with

658
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,640
hydrogen peroxide on leaves that we

659
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,400
couldn't strip

660
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,919
so it's kind of like a salvage situation

661
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,038
it's like oh crap we gotta

662
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,280
save this crop as much as we can

663
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,240
did you did you save it like did you

664
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,720
make out with

665
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,480
yeah yeah the product ended up being

666
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,200
completely fine nothing got to the bud

667
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,400
but

668
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,600
on the uh on on there's a lot on the

669
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,919
leafs like the bigger major families

670
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,359
and i feel like uh that's kind of what

671
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,880
like the fact that you were able to

672
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:20,719
proactively

673
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,640
know what like you figured out what to

674
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,120
do very quickly

675
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,000
which is good i i know i've met a lot of

676
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,678
growers who

677
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,279
didn't do not figure stuff out that

678
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,320
quickly and then

679
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,798
a small you know powdery mildew turns

680
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,399
into

681
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,839
an entire dessert like your biggest

682
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,240
catastrophe doesn't really sound that

683
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,439
bad

684
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,000
you took care of it well in a way it was

685
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,960
just

686
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,880
because um all of the work that it took

687
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,679
you know can you imagine wiping

688
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,880
like every little you know every little

689
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,640
uh

690
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,400
single serrated leaf that comes out of

691
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,919
the bud like just to make sure

692
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,480
this is what it felt like you know and

693
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,159
then um it's just all about doing

694
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,558
your research before i even started

695
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,200
growing i would read and read and read

696
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:04,879
and read

697
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,558
some of the information has not

698
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,440
translated over because it is the

699
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,240
internet

700
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,919
but uh most of it has and i'm very very

701
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,038
very thankful that the internet is even

702
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,880
here today

703
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:16,640
to be able to absorb the knowledge that

704
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,320
i've gotten for sure

705
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,960
bud washing man we learned about that

706
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,519
the other day right mr girl

707
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,360
bud washing out i have not tried it what

708
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,440
do you guys think about that

709
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,558
yay or nay what are we what do we deem i

710
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,360
i can't remember

711
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,319
um we see a lot of people doing it

712
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:34,079
nowadays

713
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,240
um right there was some concern about

714
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,079
people you know washing off a trichomes

715
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,079
but then there's the argument well and

716
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:41,519
you know outside it rains all the time

717
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,960
those watch off the trichomes no

718
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:46,960
so yeah there's a lot of uh

719
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,720
a lot of debate about bud washing so

720
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,079
i've never tried it so i can't really

721
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,000
speak too much about it

722
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:53,759
yeah i would think that it's fine to be

723
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,319
honest i think a lot of people might get

724
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,919
upset by hearing that but the trichomes

725
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,480
are not water soluble

726
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,960
themselves so i think a quick dip in the

727
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,519
pool

728
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,919
really wouldn't do much to be honest oh

729
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:09,200
you guys heard it wash your butt

730
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,159
i'm not saying i'm not saying dude i'm

731
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,480
just saying

732
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,440
i get it you know i understand the logic

733
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,038
behind it

734
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,558
right no i do too it does make sense if

735
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,839
done right i mean

736
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:21,519
you know somebody out there is going to

737
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:22,879
wash their butt and then put it in a

738
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,278
room that's 78

739
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,880
humidity and ruin it absolutely yeah

740
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:27,200
they're going to get mold and bud rot

741
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,120
and

742
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,798
they're going to be very unhappy all

743
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,639
right but they'll learn

744
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:34,558
so if you could this is one of my

745
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,440
favorite questions in the podcast here

746
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,639
if you could go back in time uh with the

747
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,000
knowledge you have now

748
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,440
right you go back in time and talk to

749
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,400
yourself before you started your first

750
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,000
grow

751
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:49,600
what advice would you give to yourself

752
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,798
a good question i like that one um

753
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:54,639
wow uh start breeding now i mean

754
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:56,639
you know that's the best way that i've

755
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,919
done

756
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,240
everything when it comes to growing is

757
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,000
just shut up and do it just start

758
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,679
doing it get your hands in the dirt so

759
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,278
to speak and

760
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,038
just do it and i wish i would have

761
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:08,640
started breeding sooner so i could get

762
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:11,839
more of the

763
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,600
hands-on experience and and knowledge

764
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,959
yeah i wish i would have started taking

765
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,959
breeding uh

766
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,240
seriously sooner because i love it it's

767
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,159
it's

768
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,038
very fun to uh one create your own

769
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,520
strain and

770
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:26,798
and to see it come to fruition right in

771
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,558
front of you you know

772
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:30,480
you've never like accidentally wrecked a

773
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:31,038
crop by like getting nail polish into

774
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,640
your

775
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:36,640
flower room uh no i have

776
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,159
uh only have one little breeding chamber

777
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,799
four by four

778
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,000
and it's constantly being exhausted i

779
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:45,119
would say maybe if the fan

780
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,519
went out and um the tent was open it

781
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,519
might

782
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,759
but uh i don't think there's enough

783
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,639
negative air pressure in

784
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:54,000
the other rooms to suck it you know into

785
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,840
those rooms but

786
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,200
luckily i haven't had that catastrophe

787
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:59,839
yet i guess that would be a good story

788
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,840
if it did happen

789
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,359
let's hope it doesn't so you get all

790
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,880
that pollen exhausting up into your

791
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:06,079
attic so just don't grill plants in your

792
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,120
attic and

793
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:10,558
you should be good to go yeah right what

794
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:11,038
we've gone over pretty much everything

795
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:13,918
we

796
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:17,038
went over you're using we know your

797
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:20,159
nutrients right uh nectar for the gods

798
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:22,000
yeah and um i'll be running just

799
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,840
cutting edge solutions micro and bloom

800
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,960
really i think if you stick to micro and

801
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:27,119
bloom and then

802
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,798
kind of work in um organic additives

803
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,399
you'll have phenomenal results as long

804
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:31,440
as your environment your genetics are

805
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,960
there

806
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,400
what temperature do you try to keep your

807
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,919
plants at in bloom and what do you try

808
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,120
to keep them at and veg and do you

809
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,440
control your humidity with a

810
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,599
dehumidifier or anything like that

811
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,960
yeah so the temperature i like to run in

812
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:48,000
flower is 78 to 81 degrees

813
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,200
because mainly because i have co2 so i

814
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,839
run it a little bit

815
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,400
warmer than traditionally and then in

816
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:54,319
veg

817
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,759
i'm i'm not too worried as long as it

818
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:58,079
doesn't get above

819
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,679
like 88 degrees and then i will start to

820
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:01,678
freak out because

821
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,720
it's a little too warm but i try to keep

822
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,400
it

823
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,679
below 88 and anywhere in there and then

824
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,759
um humidity is controlled by

825
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,600
a dehumidifier but i really don't start

826
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:14,158
running the dehumidifier until about

827
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,759
week

828
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,200
three of flower because i'm trying to

829
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,679
push that

830
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,640
um vpd the vapor pressure deficit in

831
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,880
those

832
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,720
first two weeks especially because

833
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,480
that's when there isn't any kind of bud

834
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,798
on the plant at all and

835
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,679
so i try to do that you know run that

836
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:32,798
like 70

837
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,960
i usually keep my um humidity

838
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,558
10 percent lower than my temperature and

839
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,120
that seems to be a pretty good range for

840
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:39,278
me

841
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,239
that seems like a great rule that

842
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:42,480
everyone can

843
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,919
write down keep your humidity 10 lower

844
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,038
than your temperature

845
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,240
um and vpd can you can you go a little

846
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,200
bit into that for me

847
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,919
um vpd my understanding of it is it's

848
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,080
the

849
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,038
vapor pressure deficit of the the leaf

850
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,359
in the room

851
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,079
um i could be wrong but and then you're

852
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,240
trying to

853
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:01,359
keep the somata open in order to absorb

854
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,319
more co2

855
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:07,918
and increase and drive photosynthesis so

856
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,599
i've seen good results ever since i

857
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,679
started running with it

858
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,359
and going along with it and plus my

859
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,640
electric bill has gone down because i've

860
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,879
been able to

861
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,240
keep the dehumidifier in like 70 percent

862
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,399
um

863
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,159
humidity but one thing i have noticed is

864
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,959
i need to keep my nighttime temperature

865
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,559
in check

866
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,480
i try to keep it between 65 and 70

867
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:29,759
when i am running vpd and then the last

868
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,440
two weeks i just

869
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,839
try to suck out um as much moisture as i

870
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,080
can

871
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:38,240
to hopefully uh induce trichome

872
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:41,278
development because of the uh

873
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,599
the dry air so like when you say

874
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,359
you're running vpd you mean like you're

875
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,199
just running a humidity

876
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,038
that's 10 lower than your than your

877
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,000
temperature throughout

878
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:53,200
up until week three of bloom um i'll run

879
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
that all the way until

880
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,319
the last uh i would say two weeks i run

881
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,398
that

882
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:00,079
the whole time as long as my temperature

883
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:01,839
isn't dropping at night where

884
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:03,439
that's where that controller comes in

885
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:05,839
clutch and really really handy

886
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,519
is it it'll turn off your exhaust fan

887
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,599
once it reaches

888
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:10,798
that lower threshold because if your

889
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:12,879
temperature gets too low

890
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:15,119
then you're worried about pottery mildew

891
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,360
or even like rusty fungus

892
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:18,798
our butt bud rot is uh concerned because

893
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,359
the colors are usually

894
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:23,119
um dense and and tight tightly formed

895
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,199
and the dominant strains are

896
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,879
really susceptible to that and that kind

897
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,319
of i feel like this kind of goes against

898
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,720
what's traditionally

899
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:33,038
like done in bloom like most people say

900
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,558
to lower your humidity in bloom

901
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:38,319
correct yeah usually people run like 76

902
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:40,558
degrees and like 50

903
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,720
humidity but if you look at the vpd

904
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:45,759
chart that falls almost

905
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,798
right in line to being in in the uh

906
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:50,879
the green zone as so to speak of

907
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:52,639
where you should be but yeah i push mine

908
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,919
a little bit my humidity a little bit

909
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,799
um higher than traditionally followed

910
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,720
so if your temperature is at 80 degrees

911
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:04,558
what is your humidity at

912
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,399
70 yeah i'll set my dehumidifier for 70

913
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:08,960
and then it will usually keep it

914
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:10,239
right around that 65 to 70 percent range

915
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,399
a lot of people have the knowledge that

916
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,640
if you're running over 60

917
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:16,398
humidity there's a chance of getting

918
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,440
powdery mildew so you're running it at

919
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:20,639
70 percent

920
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,200
how you preventing powdery mildew well

921
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,720
one way would be to keep your nighttime

922
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,558
temperatures warmer so you're not

923
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,720
uh creating that environment for the

924
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,599
power powdery mildew to grow because

925
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,558
usually

926
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:34,398
um hot and cold don't mix for um the

927
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:36,079
grower you know and

928
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:37,839
you'll see people will run their content

929
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:39,439
their lines outside

930
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,278
or they'll be sucking in cool air from

931
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,000
outside and they'll have water dripping

932
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:43,599
from there

933
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,519
they're ducting because it's the hot and

934
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:47,839
the cold air meeting and in that area

935
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,000
that's where you get problems but

936
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:50,959
uh one tip that i found that works

937
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,919
extremely well

938
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,600
for keeping powdery mildew at bay is

939
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,000
foliar spraying with uh

940
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:58,639
silica i know it's not really doing

941
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,558
anything

942
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,320
um to the plant because it's not really

943
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,639
a plant available i believe

944
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,240
with a potassium silicate but i use a

945
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,038
potassium silicate

946
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,359
and i spray it on my plants anytime i do

947
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:12,079
a

948
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,439
foliar all through veg all the way until

949
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,839
i hit flower and then i stop

950
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,640
but what that's doing is it's changing

951
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,278
the

952
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,399
the ph of of the leaf and creating that

953
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,640
barrier on the leaf

954
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,759
itself and ever since i started doing

955
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,519
that i have never

956
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,038
seen one little speck of powdery mildew

957
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,558
at all that's awesome

958
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:30,480
i never heard that before yeah i mean

959
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,798
either that's a pretty good tip

960
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,480
yeah absolutely so you said you're

961
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:34,960
referring to night time so you're doing

962
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,319
18

963
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,360
6 for veg yeah 18 60 all right well i

964
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:42,398
run 20 and

965
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:44,240
4 20 on uh four off in

966
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:45,759
my little veg area which is just a

967
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,640
thousand watts and then a

968
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:49,519
100 watt like a spectrum king light and

969
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,159
then

970
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,319
um in my main flowering room to cut

971
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,480
costs because 5 000 watts i run 18

972
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:58,079
six and then as i'm getting closer to

973
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,720
flour like a week before i'm in a flower

974
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:03,439
i lowered the uh the nights

975
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,558
during the day time by an hour like

976
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,440
every other day or

977
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:08,398
every day oh so you ease them in yeah i

978
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,960
transition

979
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:12,079
into the uh just like outside they

980
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,679
transition into

981
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:17,678
the the flip you know yeah yeah no it's

982
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,080
cool i've never done it before but

983
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,840
i've heard of people doing it and i

984
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,079
guess unless somebody does it side by

985
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:27,278
side we'll never really know the

986
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:29,199
if it truly makes a difference but

987
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,200
well i figure i'm saving on an hour of

988
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,360
electricity you know every single day

989
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,080
and i don't see any negative

990
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,558
negative results from it yeah that's

991
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,000
true

992
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:39,759
it seems like you have your [ __ ] dialed

993
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,839
in pretty good man thanks so

994
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:43,839
yeah hopefully by now i would right

995
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,919
so what's up coming for you um are you

996
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:49,359
working on any projects

997
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,600
uh you know within the industry or

998
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:54,879
anything um upcoming really

999
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:56,000
just trying to work on the the genetics

1000
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,799
is a very high priority

1001
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,278
for me i have invested a lot of my time

1002
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:01,759
into

1003
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:03,278
the genetics of square one genetics and

1004
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:05,440

everybody go go buy your genetics from

1054
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,320
this guy because you really don't want

1055

to run into having shitty genetics

1056
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,960
because you can have everything else

1057
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,559
perfect and then

1058
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,079
you have shitty genetics you're screwed

1059
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,639
