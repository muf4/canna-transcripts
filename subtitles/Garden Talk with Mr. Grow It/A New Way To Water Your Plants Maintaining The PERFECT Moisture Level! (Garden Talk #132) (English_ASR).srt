00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,680
that Grassroots fabric pots they put on

168

it's their second annual and um this one

169
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,879

00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,839
Productions and he's a you know really

174
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,560
kind of early adopter pioneer here in

175
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:06,198
living soil and a cool guy and he was it

176
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,639
was hosted on his his farm and uh it it

177
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:13,000
brought together a really

178
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:17,439
wide uh smattering of of really smart

179
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,199
people in the living soil world and so

180
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,879
we had a bunch of the major soil

181
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,919
producers were there um we had some

182
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:27,680
great agronomist giving speeches and and

183
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:30,198
talks um there's there was a a lot of

184
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,759
workshops Hands-On workshops and it's

185
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,038
overall just a really great event and

186
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,319
you know I hope they I hope they keep

187
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,800
doing it I know they're they're talking

188
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,479
about it um keep keep doing those events

189
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,598
and those are really kind of a a a

190
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:47,199
followup to there were these um the

191
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,959
regen conferences they were called it

192
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,240
was like the science of regenerative

193
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:55,839
production or something like that that

194
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,840
uh were were held there was initially up

195
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,079
in Humble County Josh Rutherford put all

196
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,560
those on and um

197
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,158
and then they they were up in hot County

198
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,199
and then they they had a bunch traveling

199
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:08,000
around the US and then that that that

200
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,840
project uh transitioned out and and

201
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,478
Grassroots took up a similar version so

202
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:14,519
um those are events that I've been

203
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,758
participating in for for quite a few

204
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:20,158
years now uh either usually just as a

205
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,360
speaker and attendee um there always

206
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:25,478
great learning environments we uh at

207
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,120
this last one our whole team went Cooper

208
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:30,878
Izzy and I and Izzy Izzy did a really

209
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:35,320
great talk on

210
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,719
uh basically soil moisture data and um

211
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,120
moisture release curves uh some of the

212
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,159
new tech we'll we'll talk about some of

213
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,799
those things today I imagine um and then

214
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:47,240
uh Cooper and I built out a big display

215
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,519
station with lots of raised beds and

216
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,799
pots and all kinds of different water

217
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,839
sources and and built blue mat systems

218
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,519
all throughout those and operated them

219
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,079
and then gave a couple hour workshop on

220
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,399
how to do that which was great I mean we

221
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:02,599
got it was it was really great to put

222
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,759
all that information in one place and

223
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,839
and kind of show it off and answer

224
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:09,838
questions in real time and um yeah

225
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,079
honestly we if we do some of these

226
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,800
events in the future we're we're kind of

227
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:16,159
kicking around the idea of maybe having

228
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:20,039
like a really a longer form irrigation

229
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:21,919
workshop at something like that so um

230
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:24,159
you know we'd love to I'm really curious

231
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,519
what people's feedback would be on that

232
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,360
if it's something they'd be interested

233
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,959
in um so that we do trade shows

234
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,120
periodically we were just out in

235
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:36,639
Minnesota uh maybe two three weeks ago

236
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,879
um I he gave a presentation there and

237
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:42,240
that that got a lot of really good

238
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:44,600
feedback um and yeah so like those kind

239
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,600
of industry trade shows we go to

240
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,959
sometimes they're hit or miss and um you

241
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,959
know whether they're worth going to or

242
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:54,719
not but think the last one was Minnesota

243
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:56,359
was an interesting Market to be in um

244
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,800
like a new state that recently changed

245
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,240
their laws to allow different kinds of

246
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,439
growing

247
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,079
um so those are always kind of fun

248
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,959
places to be there to be where there's

249
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:07,439
where there's new people that are uh

250
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:10,039
learning for the first time yeah what

251
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,680
did you think of the soil life Summit

252
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:14,599
there I thought it was great I was able

253
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:16,838
to catch Izzy's talk and uh it was

254
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,360
loaded with information actually I'd

255
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,680
like to get him on the podcast if he'd

256
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,440
like if he want to come on maybe you can

257
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:25,679
hook me up on that Avenue but he had uh

258
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,480
so much good information the moisture

259
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,838
release curve which is what we're going

260
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,440
to get into here in a little bit I

261
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,440
remember him talking about that and um I

262
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,839
didn't get a chance to attend the

263
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,839
workshop but that whole Summit was

264
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,079
fantastic and I'll definitely be there

265
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,279
next year if it does happen now before

266
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:42,679
we get into the moisture release curves

267
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,919
is there anything else happening in the

268
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,759
industry particularly related to

269
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:48,919
cultivation or irrigation that you want

270
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,679
to talk about that's a good question we

271
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:54,799
we're in a unique position here uh

272
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:58,479
because we work with cultivators all

273
00:10:54,799 --> 00:11:01,479
over the US Canada we have um a lot of

274
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,440
big projects in a Australia right now um

275
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,600
I just sent a big system to Thailand

276
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,560
this week uh you know so we're all over

277
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,000
the globe actually working with with

278
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:13,759
Growers and so we get to talk to a lot

279
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
of people and see what they're up to and

280
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,078
what they're what their pain points are

281
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,440
what their struggles are you know how

282
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,919
they're doing what kind of prices

283
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,240
they're getting for for products things

284
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:27,439
like that and um so there's a yeah it's

285
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,759
a really it's a it's a cool spot to be

286
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,800
in um you know we also work with a lot

287
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,360
of the different soil companies so there

288
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,439
most of the other major kind of living

289
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:41,560
soil companies recommend our products

290
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:43,079
and so we have a lot of U uh you know

291
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:45,078
get customers through that and and

292
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,679
clients to work with what's happening

293
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:49,519
man it's all kinds of stuff's happening

294
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:52,559
depends on which state you're in uh you

295
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,639
know there's there's markets that have

296
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,239
had you know like these legal markets

297
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,519
for long long periods of time and

298
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,440
they're really established markets um

299
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:02,679
we're not seeing

300
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,000
as many like new facilities going in

301
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,759
there like Colorado's a good example

302
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,559
there's not a ton of new projects

303
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,720
happening in Colorado we do even though

304
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:12,239
we're based here we do probably 95% of

305
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,399
our work outside of here

306
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,000
um and the ones that do go in in those

307
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:20,360
established markets are are very large

308
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,399
so you know it's not it's not crazy for

309
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,919
us to be working on 100,000 square feet

310
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,039
of you know indoor production um in some

311
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:28,919
of those in some of those markets which

312
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:31,879
we do do with uh and with more of our

313
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,559
kind of traditional drip irrigation um

314
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:36,519
designs and

315
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:38,679
Engineering the the places that are the

316
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,480
most fun to work are are states that are

317
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:43,120
are newer markets um or kind of markets

318
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,159
that have have something's changed or

319
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,759
shifted and there's like a re kind of

320
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:49,759
revitalized energy around it and you get

321
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,240
these kind of like medium-size

322
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,480
facilities and a lot of them are in

323
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,879
green houses and again back to that

324
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,959
living soil piece like a lot of them are

325
00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:00,159
uh living soil Growers that are that are

326
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:04,278
growing like a boutique product that

327
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:05,919
might fetch a higher price um we like to

328
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:08,360
yeah I I like working with those with

329
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:11,679
those folks too cuz they're you know

330
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,879
they're the new newer newer Growers are

331
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,919
are always really um open to to new

332
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,360
ideas and not to say that that that

333
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:20,479
seasoned uh experienced folks aren't

334
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,120
either I mean if they're still

335
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:27,240
successful they probably are pretty open

336
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:29,278
to new ideas um but uh yeah I it's it's

337
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,159
um sometimes a little easier to to talk

338
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:34,439
to the empty cup versus the one that's

339
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:38,799
already overflowing you know what I mean

340
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:43,440
um and yeah I mean we could go on about

341
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:44,679
specifics there but it's uh it's a it's

342
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,160
been I think the last year has been

343
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:49,759
really challenging I think overall that

344
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,559
that industry has was was kind of in a

345
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,799
bit of a slump last year and a lot of

346
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:55,439
the folks that are in other kind of

347
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:58,120
ancillary businesses like ours that you

348
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,519
know maybe provide soil or lighting or

349
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:04,399
uh nutrients or whatever

350
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:09,360
uh had kind of tough years in 2022

351
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:10,720
2023 and I think it really speaks to you

352
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,480
know I think this I think a great thing

353
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,560
to do is like look around and see who's

354
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,000
still operating you know as businesses

355
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:19,198
that are kind of providing services in

356
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,600
the industry and also um the the Growers

357
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,198
and suppliers and who's still operating

358
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,120
and and not to say that lots of really

359
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:25,799
good people that knew what they were

360
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,320
doing weren't able to continue running a

361
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:29,599
business but um the ones that the ones

362
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,440
that are still operating

363
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,879
probably have a a pretty good product

364
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,160
and and um know what they're doing and

365
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:37,320
if they stuck it out through those last

366
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:39,759
couple years I

367
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,560
think um I think I think this next year

368
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,879
is going to be there's going to be a

369
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:46,198
bump I think there's be a kind of an

370
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:48,519
upswing in in in sales and all all

371
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:50,758
products related to that and and to the

372
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:53,919
actual material itself

373
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:57,320
so yeah I think uh I look forward to

374
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:59,799
2024 we're already seeing kind of a a

375
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,240
pretty pretty massive

376
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:06,359
spike in in what we're doing just in the

377
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,959
last two months um which is which is

378
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,519
typical for like springtime we always

379
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:13,799
see a big boost in in in sales and in

380
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,440
projects being you know actually

381
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,799
launching um this time of year but yeah

382
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,639
I'm just seeing more and more I'm seeing

383
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:24,799
more and more homeg Growers uh really

384
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:26,120
really doing their thing and and that's

385
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:29,120
that's a group of people we've always

386
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,360
worked with closely uh you know for IR

387
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,480
ation and and helping them kind of

388
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,000
automate their their home grows and and

389
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,720
you know free up time and have better

390
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,360
success and better yields and better

391
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,240
product and all that um so that group of

392
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,759
people that home Growers you know that's

393
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,198
we they've been with us for a long time

394
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,039
and we don't ever forget that and um you

395
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:52,799
know are really excited to serve them

396
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:54,838
even better moving forward here yeah the

397
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,799
home Growers that's really most of the

398
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,240
audience listening into this right now

399
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,758
grow at home you know whether it be

400
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,318
indoors or outdoors and yeah talking

401
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,240
about the industry and how there's been

402
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:05,479
struggles we've seen it with

403
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,079
particularly with lighting companies

404
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,720
getting closed down left and right I

405
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:09,879
mean there's been a handful of companies

406
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,560
within the past couple years that have

407
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:15,600
closed down and uh it's it's sad to see

408
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,599
but hope we go back to an incline here

409
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,920
where as far as uh more and more States

410
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,839
legalizing it more and more people

411
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:23,559
getting into it so on and so forth so

412
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,319
we'll just have to kind of wait and see

413
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:26,958
no totally and like our strategy with

414
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:29,439
that with with Staying Alive in there is

415
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,679
to is that constant innovation piece

416
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,160
like look what we're doing and look

417
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:34,479
what's going well what are the problems

418
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:37,559
and like okay how do we go and solve

419
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,720
those problems and you know get a better

420
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:43,039
product and and really just being

421
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,959
staying on the you know the uh ahead of

422
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:46,679
the curve as much as possible always

423
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:50,599
looking at new tech as it's becoming

424
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:51,638
available or we're developing it and

425
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,959
yeah again you know you look at like

426
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,759
lighting companies there a lot of them

427
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:57,278
were doing the exact same thing right

428
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,680
they were kind of selling very very

429
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,600
similar products and coming out of the

430
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:05,359
same production facilities you know

431
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:08,439
maybe overseas or whatnot um

432
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:11,359
and uh yeah I think I think Innovation

433
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:14,279
and forward moving is is is a is a good

434
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:16,918
strategy for for Staying Alive in a in a

435
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:18,918
competitive world I completely agree so

436
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:20,480
we're going to get into new technology

437
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:23,079
here in a minute but first I want to get

438
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,279
into moisture release curves now that's

439
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:26,519
something that I don't think a lot of my

440
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:28,439
audience is really aware of so talk to

441
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:31,519
us all about moisture release curves

442
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:34,679
moisture curve is a is a graph the chart

443
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,558
and it's got uh you X and Y uh axes

444
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:40,000
right so a vertical and a horizontal

445
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:43,240
axis and the vertical AIS is often

446
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,720
represented uh by volumetric water

447
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,400
content so um let me just jump into this

448
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,038
point there's there's there's two main

449
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:54,200
ways to measure soil moisture and the

450
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:56,319
first is through vwc volumetric water

451
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,960
content your

452
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:02,759
vwc and the the second is uh soil

453
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,640
moisture tension so these are are two

454
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:07,279
different uh data points that you can

455
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,440
pull out of any uh soil solution and

456
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,639
they're going to give you different

457
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,159
numbers in different in different uh

458
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,720
units of measurement so volumetric water

459
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:18,679
content is is the percentage of water

460
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,120
that is that this is made up of the soil

461
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:25,720
so um you know maybe it's 50% right so a

462
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:30,079
soil a soil solution might be 50% water

463
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:33,120
or 40% water or 30% water so by volume

464
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,599
it's the 30% water and there's a lot of

465
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,959
really cool data that you can pull out

466
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:40,359
of that and strategy that can be

467
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,440
developed based on that that information

468
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:45,359
um the second way to measure uh soil

469
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,679
moisture is is through

470
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:52,119
tensiometers and tensiometers are

471
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:55,120
devices that measure pressure so what

472
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,678
those devices usually look like well

473
00:18:55,119 --> 00:19:00,519
honestly they look a lot like the blue

474
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:02,600
mats do it's a it's a ceramic tip uh

475
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:06,240
like a ceramic cone with a with a tube

476
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:10,879
on top of it and then attached to that

477
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:13,720
is some sort of uh pressure gauge so as

478
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,679
the soil dries out it it creates a

479
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:20,519
negative pressure inside uh that tube

480
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:24,159
and that so and then that uh negative

481
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:27,240
pressure is expressed as a vacuum so uh

482
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:29,840
it'll it'll read in units of pressure

483
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,880
and um it's often often measured in Cen

484
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:34,240
bars or

485
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:38,120
mbars uh which is U just this little

486
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,759
like something to note one bar is is

487
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:43,239
equal to one atmosphere of pressure or

488
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:46,558
15 psi and it's really it's like the

489
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:51,000
metric uh style of of measuring pressure

490
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:53,759
so we use the PSI and and um standard

491
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
measurements but then in uh in metric

492
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,400
it's it's in bars so a milar is 1,000th

493
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,319
of a bar or a centa bar is 1 100th of a

494
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,960
bar so these are these units of pressure

495
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:05,599
that are measured and most most of those

496
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,919
tensiometers either measure in Cen bars

497
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:11,678
or mbars so if we jump back to the

498
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,840
moisture release curve itself uh we have

499
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,880
that vertical axis that's measuring a

500
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,798
percentage and we're having the uh the

501
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,120
horizontal axis which is which is

502
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:24,918
measuring uh

503
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:27,599
mbars and what we see is a a a there's a

504
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:29,520
graph that gets expressed on this and

505
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,558
that's that this it's a curve curve and

506
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,558
it starts high on the on the on the

507
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:36,759
vertical axis and then it will uh Be

508
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,440
steady for a little bit so that's that

509
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:41,038
that indicates a really high percentage

510
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,440
of water and when it's it'll be flat for

511
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:47,079
a little bit and that's a uh that'll

512
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,320
translate to a low uh tensiometer number

513
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:52,399
and when it's flat at the top that that

514
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,079
indicates a full saturation so you're

515
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,720
you're at a point of of

516
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,199
runoff um so if any more water was added

517
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,319
it would immediately run off out of the

518
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,600
pot

519
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:03,519
and then that curve it's flat for a

520
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:05,959
little bit and then it it falls off

521
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:08,599
precipitously and plunges down and

522
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:13,000
that's that's the soil drying out so as

523
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:15,359
the uh percentage of water drops um the

524
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,759
uh the tension the soil moisture tension

525
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,319
starts to grow and uh it drops off

526
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:24,119
pretty steeply and then it starts to

527
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:25,798
kind of ease that curve off and um so

528
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:28,278
you get this kind of nice rounded piece

529
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,759
of the graph and then it flattens out

530
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:33,519
and when it flattens out again very low

531
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:36,079
on the on the graph uh that's that's

532
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,720
your permanent Wilt point so the soil is

533
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:39,158
be is say dried out there's no more

534
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,880
moisture left in

535
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:47,720
it and each uh soil medium out there has

536
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:49,120
a unique uh uh moisture release curve so

537
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,278
it's like a it's almost like a a

538
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:53,798
fingerprint for each soil has its own

539
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:55,599
particular moist moisture release curve

540
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:59,119
and there are methods for determining

541
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:01,278
what a you know a custom blend

542
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:04,038
might be specifically a lot of major

543
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:06,798
manufacturers of soil have that data

544
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:07,960
that you can get um there's also some

545
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,400
pretty

546
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,159
clear uh there's it's pretty standard

547
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,600
for certain soil types so they'll

548
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:18,880
measure it in like you know Sandy LOM

549
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:21,879
soils or uh like bark they usually use

550
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:26,159
as one of the controls like pine bark um

551
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,960
but then coco or Pete or engineered

552
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,320
potting soil Blends that use organic

553
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,600
material which would kind of be like a

554
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:34,639
living soil mix something that's has

555
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:36,000
peite and either Pete or cocoa and

556
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,278
compost in

557
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,960
it um and they all kind of have

558
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:45,200
different shaped curves and they they

559
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:48,640
dry out in different ways um and why

560
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,240
this data is really interesting is you

561
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:55,600
can determine the moisture release curve

562
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:58,200
of a particular soil uh medium or soil

563
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:58,959
composition and and then find that chart

564
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,840
and then

565
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,440
understand what is the best what are the

566
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:06,079
targets that we want to hit for

567
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,679
irrigating that particular soil so when

568
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:11,839
do we want to start an irrigation event

569
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:17,200
um and and then we when do we want to

570
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:20,558
stop it so if we say we uh we

571
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,278
irrigate like a um like a cocoa based

572
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:24,918
soil um you know it's going to start at

573
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:27,079
one point it's it's we're going to the

574
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:29,480
irrigation going to turn off it's going

575
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:31,639
to be high up on the percentage and low

576
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,000
on the tension and then it's going to

577
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,919
start to dry out and it's going to dry

578
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,079
out it's going to dry out it's going to

579
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:40,720
get down to a point um that's that's

580
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:43,119
approaching uh the the wilt point which

581
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,798
we don't ever want to hit and then

582
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,519
there's a there's a point on that curve

583
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,480
we can kind of identify it very

584
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:50,798
specifically and we can say that's our

585
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,200
trigger point for another irrigation

586
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:53,599
event and that's going to then it's

587
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,480
going to go back to the top of that

588
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:59,000
curve and go back down again

589
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,839
so um we're keeping

590
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,200
we're keeping the moisture level uh in a

591
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:07,759
within a window where it is plant

592
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,519
available and because we don't want to

593
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:10,640
oversaturate it because then it's not

594
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:12,839
going to be plant available and it's

595
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,720
going to do harm to the to the to the

596
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:17,158
plant itself and we don't want to dry it

597
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,120
out too much uh because again we're

598
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:22,640
going to do harm and damage to the plant

599
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:26,079
um there's some other factors to to look

600
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:29,278
at two which is the nutrient content in

601
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:32,918
the you know your EC in the soil

602
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:34,159
um as the percentage of water drops your

603
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:38,038
EC

604
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:40,559
increases and that's because uh as the

605
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:42,200
as the percentage of water drops the the

606
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,200
concentration just becomes greater of

607
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,240
whatever nutrients in there so if you

608
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,038
took I don't know you would like have a

609
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,278
pot of coffee like on the burner and it

610
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:51,679
Cooks down and it Cooks down and

611
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:53,359
eventually would turn into like kind of

612
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,360
a sludge right because we've removed the

613
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:58,079
water but there's still material in

614
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,398
there that's the same kind of concept

615
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,720
with with drying it out and a lot of

616
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:04,239
what like crop steering so that's a term

617
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,600
that gets thrown around a lot in

618
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,278
different ways what that is is cycling

619
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:12,678
plants uh back and forth on that

620
00:25:10,278 --> 00:25:15,000
moisture release curve and drying them

621
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:16,519
out to a point where the plant is still

622
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,480
uptaking water it's still nutrient

623
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:21,240
available so so so plant available the

624
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,000
water content in the soil um but the

625
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,200
nutrient level is very high so it's able

626
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,960
to uptake a lot of nutrients and then

627
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,038
taking it right down to a point before

628
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,840
it's starting to damage the plant and

629
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:33,879
then introducing another irrigation

630
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:36,199
event and um kind of repeating that

631
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,559
process so it's this kind of pulsing

632
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,600
cycle that you know looked at over time

633
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:43,798
is up and down and up and down and so

634
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:46,918
it's dry wet dry wet but within a very

635
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:50,759
specific um band

636
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:52,440
of of measurement so you know if you're

637
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:56,000
measuring in tensiometers and you're

638
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,600
using uh mbars to measure that something

639
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,919
like a like a Coco has a pretty pretty

640
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:04,759
large window you know you might be able

641
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:08,278
to start um irrigating when it when it

642
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:09,839
uh when it dries down to 70 mbars and

643
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:12,079
then you want to irrigate back until it

644
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:15,480
hits about 10 mbars which is very wet

645
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:17,639
and then let it dry back down to 70 um

646
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,519
you know more of like a like a Pete

647
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,080
based living soil kind of thing you're

648
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:24,918
going to you're going to start U uh

649
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:28,319
irrigating around 100 100 between 100

650
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:31,080
120 depending on the composition and and

651
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:34,038
water it down to like 40 or 50 mbars and

652
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:35,319
then repeat that process and yeah

653
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:39,158
there's some really cool stuff that

654
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:41,319
happens in there to the plant um you get

655
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:43,080
these generative cues that are

656
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:45,240
introduced to the plant when you when

657
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:47,079
you cycle it through that dryback phase

658
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,319
so it's you know the one of the other

659
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:50,038
terms get thrown around a lot is like

660
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,439
dryb backs what's your dryback are you

661
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:55,158
doing this and and what we're looking at

662
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:58,558
is is running the soil down that uh

663
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:00,399
moisture release curve um and and and

664
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:01,599
drying it out and why do we do that well

665
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:03,239
we don't want to dry it out to a point

666
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:04,319
of of Wilt that stresses the plant it's

667
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,200
going to be permanent damage it's going

668
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,000
to impact yield it's going to impact

669
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,558
Vigor it's going to you know all all

670
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,720
that stuff but by by drawing it back to

671
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:15,278
just before the point where we're

672
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,798
hitting that we're introducing the

673
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:18,960
concept of stress we're not actually

674
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:21,079
stressing the plant like on a real level

675
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,399
but we're letting the plant know and you

676
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:25,720
know going an anthrop more I'm going to

677
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:28,359
I'm going to turn the plan into a person

678
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:31,880
here for a second and uh you know we're

679
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:35,599
introducing that concept of stress and

680
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,440
um when we do that it it's it's it's

681
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,918
kind of reminding the plant that hey

682
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,919
there's a there's a you know there's a

683
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,320
there's an end to this there's

684
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:47,600
impermanence that does exist and um it

685
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:49,639
uh it'll it'll can trigger you you know

686
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,480
doing it within certain Windows like

687
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,840
having a longer dryback period will help

688
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,880
induce flowering in a plant keeping it

689
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,319
in a narrow wetter band will will keep a

690
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,559
plant in a vegetative state longer but

691
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,879
by drying it back a little bit more um

692
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,798
we're going to see a u we're giving it

693
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,640
we're giving it a generative cue so we

694
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,918
we're telling the plant hey it's time to

695
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,038
start the second half of your life cycle

696
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:14,919
it's time to start producing flowers um

697
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:16,839
and to and to start uh fruit set so

698
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:19,159
there's again there's things with

699
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:20,119
moisture levels that can be um can be

700
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:24,200
done to

701
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:26,479
manipulate um those functions in the

702
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,880
plant I know that's a lot and there's a

703
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,000
lot you can kind of take each one of

704
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,200
those little places there and jump off

705
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,480
and talk more about it and talk about

706
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:39,440
specific strategy that's that's species

707
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:41,798
specific or strain specific even um but

708
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,720
that's the general concept of a moisture

709
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:46,158
release curve I appreciate you breaking

710
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,399
that down for us we have lots of people

711
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:51,039
that do dryb backs or drought stress

712
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:53,239
Precision stress in that method in order

713
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,359
to you know try to achieve several

714
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,599
things right whether they're trying to

715
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:58,278
stress out the plant to have more

716
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:00,719
secondary metabolites or or what now the

717
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:03,519
numbers that you mentioned there it's 70

718
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,159
mbars at that point to aate and then

719
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,159
it'll go down to 10 which you said is

720
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,200
considered wet is that using the blue

721
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,519
mat moisture meter I was told now here's

722
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,038
so much conflicting information online

723
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,440
where I believe the general range for

724
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:19,480
those meters would be you want to stay

725
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:22,360
in between 50 and 100 mbars is that not

726
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,038
correct or what would be the ideal range

727
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:27,359
to stay in so 50 and 100 m bar is a

728
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:30,440
great range for a living soil blend for

729
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:33,398
a living like so or really most potting

730
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,519
soil mixes right so anything that is in

731
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:38,079
U yeah so it's like again that's like

732
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,399
that's a blend of some sort of compost

733
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,319
some sort of Iration material like

734
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:43,398
pearlite and then and and something that

735
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:45,918
holds a lot of water like something very

736
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:50,079
porous like uh like peed or cocoa it's

737
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,640
going to absorb water um that 7010 range

738
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,759
that's if you running pure cocoa so

739
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,600
that's more of like a hydro kind of

740
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:58,519
application um you can kind you can it

741
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:00,439
dries out quick cocoa dries out pretty

742
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:02,440
quick so that's why it does have a

743
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,640
little bit wider and you can you can

744
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,120
bring the moisture level um you can get

745
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,159
a lot wetter and operated at a much

746
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:13,158
wetter level so that's why that 10 is

747
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:15,240
the number um again yeah so if if you're

748
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:16,799
running in a hydro kind of uh

749
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,399
environment where you're using synthetic

750
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:21,319
nutrients and cocoa uh that's that's the

751
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:22,959
range I'd go with but if it's in potting

752
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,278
soil like an amended potting soil

753
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,759
engineered media however you want to

754
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:29,159
describe it living soil mix um that 50

755
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:32,359
to 100 is is accurate you can do that in

756
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:36,000
large field applications with overhead

757
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:37,918
watering um and a lot of sensor data you

758
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,880
can do that with drip irrigation like in

759
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,200
a larger Hydro facility or something

760
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:46,880
like that um or you can use blue mats to

761
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,798
do it and the the the bloats um are you

762
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,360
know

763
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:52,240
like we you know we've talked about them

764
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:54,839
before but just to give a a quick recap

765
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,519
what they are is they are they're a

766
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:59,199
tensiometer they're um you know for the

767
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,319
for the people that are watching this

768
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,960
visually it's it's one of these things

769
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:05,439
um it's a tube it's a plastic tube with

770
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,519
a ceramic tip on the top and then there

771
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,679
is a valve at the very top of it with a

772
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,359
tube running through it and that valve

773
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,840
opens and closes based on the soil

774
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:16,000
moisture level so as the soil dries out

775
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:19,278
the tip dries out the a negative

776
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
pressure is uh created inside the tube

777
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,919
and um there's a diaphragm in here that

778
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,480
is is sucked down by that negative

779
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,960
pressure which opens the valve

780
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,639
physically uh on the on the top of the

781
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,600
comp carrots blue mat carrots and that

782
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:34,398
valve opens and water is able to flow

783
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:37,359
through the tube and it'll drip out

784
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:39,719
either into um just directly into the

785
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:43,439
pot in a very small container um it

786
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:46,159
could feed into uh a drip ring there's

787
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,240
um some really interesting kind of

788
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,039
products like these these drip rings

789
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,960
that they they can feed right into that

790
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:55,319
have emitters in them and then drip in

791
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:58,240
in many different spots um or we we use

792
00:31:55,319 --> 00:32:00,480
a soaker hose uh we call Blue soak and

793
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,038
it's it's made out of tyac it's it

794
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,440
operates at really really low pressures

795
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:06,759
and anyway so these are the water

796
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,360
delivery mechanisms and the basic uh

797
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:13,599
functionality is that soil dries out a

798
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:16,558
valve opens um the system Waters up to

799
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,879
that to a certain trigger point then uh

800
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:20,119
the water turns off and then you get

801
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,080
that dry back so again that's the same

802
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:25,119
thing with that moisture relief curve

803
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:27,480
you're you're watering uh the soil is

804
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:30,199
getting wetter and wetter towards the

805
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,839
top of that the curve um the water turns

806
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,278
off and then it dries back and the soil

807
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,398
dries back and dries back and dries back

808
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:37,558
until it hits a lower set point and then

809
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:40,079
it turns itself on now if you're using

810
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:41,558
some sort of like um digital sensor or

811
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:43,918
something like that that you might have

812
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:46,038
that that's operating a pump or solenoid

813
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,600
valves in a drip irrigation system to

814
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:50,440
turn turn it on also so those are some

815
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:52,319
of the more sophisticated ways of doing

816
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,840
it with traditional drip irrigation and

817
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:57,319
you know more expensive uh uh electric

818
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:01,079
all there's lots and lots of sensors

819
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:05,319
that that can that can do that you know

820
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:07,439
some better than others um and again

821
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:09,398
when you're in that uh vegetative state

822
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,278
of of growth you're keeping it wetter in

823
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:14,119
a narrow band of wet and in a uh the

824
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:16,599
flowering State and particular in

825
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:18,158
stretch uh at the transition point you

826
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:20,879
want to have a wider you want to have a

827
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:24,080
bigger dryback period there too and what

828
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,799
we found with the blue mats is that they

829
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,079
kind of do that on their own so when

830
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:28,319
they're when they're placed in the soil

831
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:30,000
and operate

832
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,240
when the plants are smaller and they're

833
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,960
in veg they are keeping it in a in a

834
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,079
pretty narrow band because they're able

835
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,480
to water and keep up with the that

836
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:42,000
moisture level so the it's a much more

837
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,000
static uh wet dry wet dry period uh in

838
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,839
veg and then as soon as the plants hit

839
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,278
stretch they start consuming water much

840
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:50,038
faster and that and then it takes a

841
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:51,960
little it takes a a little bit of time

842
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:55,919
for the for the for the bloat to catch

843
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:57,880
back up so you get so you without

844
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,559
adjusting anything you're you're you're

845
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,360
getting longer dryback periods during

846
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:04,519
the stretch and flower uh periods when

847
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:06,759
there's more water consumption so when

848
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:10,960
you want more uh dryb backs they're kind

849
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:13,119
of automatically doing that and um and

850
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,480
and cycling through that uh that

851
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,240
moisture release curve and and really

852
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,559
they're kind of doing this automatic

853
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:23,319
crop steering uh just on on the

854
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:25,918
individual containers got it and for

855
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,919
anyone wanting more details on blue mats

856
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,559
or what blue mat setup to use for each

857
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,480
container size we did all of that in the

858
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,559
last episode so I urge you to check out

859
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,719
the last episode that Michael and I did

860
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:37,918
uh he went into detail about all that

861
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,439
stuff I want to flip it up though and

862
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,838
talk about some new technology for

863
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,519
watering plants there is new things that

864
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:46,759
are coming out and I think that's what

865
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:48,679
excites people a lot talk to us about

866
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:52,000
some of the new technology for watering

867
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:53,679
plants sure yeah um well what we've

868
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,280
we've been doing here we we do our own

869
00:34:53,679 --> 00:35:00,960
R&amp;D um and we do that through some of

870
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,880
the uh some of the uh we have a facility

871
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,679
we have kind of just a small operation

872
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,160
here at our our warehouse and offices um

873
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:10,399
a lot of the people we know and work

874
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:13,879
with have their own home grows and then

875
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:17,680
there's quite a few uh you know larger

876
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:19,000
commercial um Growers either in here in

877
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:20,319
Colorado or in other places of the

878
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
country that we'd like to collaborate

879
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,440
with to to really do all this R&amp;D so you

880
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,440
know the process that we go through is

881
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,838
yeah usually one of the guys here at the

882
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,960
office starts messing with some idea at

883
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:33,960
home and then we try to replicate it

884
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,320
here in the office and then we and then

885
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,000
we send out a bunch of systems and do

886
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,920
some pilot programs with um a bunch of

887
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,880
different folks and uh yeah we've had

888
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,159
really cool um kind of you know that's

889
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,960
how we've done a lot of stuff honestly

890
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:50,799
is in collaboration with with the

891
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:55,599
customers and that we work with and the

892
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:57,079
big thing that we've been doing is um is

893
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,039
with blue mats because that's kind of

894
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:03,599
you know kind of our our wheelhouse

895
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:06,440
mostly is to uh preset the blue mats so

896
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,720
in in the past when you would get a blue

897
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,240
mat carrot and you would set it up and

898
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:13,000
you hook it all up to the system there'd

899
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,439
be a process where you would would dial

900
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,199
it in there's a little brown cap on the

901
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,800
top that you can spin and it open

902
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:20,199
changes the flow rates and stuff like

903
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,160
that um or the moisture level that the

904
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:25,719
the system turns on and off

905
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:27,920
at and what we're doing now is uh we we

906
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:29,759
going to built a station here at our

907
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,039
office where we're able to to to set

908
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,400
them ear ahead of time and um you know

909
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:37,800
like the visually here it's like we

910
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,639
we'll set them and then we put a cap on

911
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,000
the top we put this protective cap on

912
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:46,159
the top and underneath that

913
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,880
um just going to pop this off underneath

914
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:51,559
that we'll put a few marks so there'll

915
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:55,720
be a red mark and a blue mark on there

916
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:57,639
and what we can do now is uh when these

917
00:36:55,719 --> 00:37:00,239
things come in the mail all you have to

918
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:02,078
do is soak the bottoms screw the top on

919
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,639
and it's going to be it's going to be

920
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:07,119
set um to produce a certain moisture

921
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,639
level at a particular pressure so the

922
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,680
back the pressure on the back end of the

923
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:13,879
system um you know say it's a it's kind

924
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:17,159
of like the full pressure like 12 to 15

925
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:19,599
psi if uh you know if you if you keep it

926
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,279
right at this blue Mark here uh lined up

927
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,160
with this this fin piece if you keep it

928
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,480
at the blue Mark um you're going to hit

929
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:26,039
a certain moisture level like that's

930
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,639
about where you want it if you're

931
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:29,719
running it off of Gravity so you'll need

932
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:32,159
have 1 to two PSI you're going to move

933
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:34,480
it closer to the to the red mark on

934
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:36,679
there and we've produced a chart that

935
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,000
has a kind of all these corresponding

936
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:41,199
values that represent the backend

937
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,199
pressure where this dial should be set

938
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:44,799
and it's really just like a quarter turn

939
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:47,039
of the dial that you're ever going to be

940
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,079
moving through yeah so that's that's

941
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:52,800
kind of the newest thing we're doing and

942
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:55,280
what that allows us to do is is send out

943
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,839
uh carrots for for you know just a few

944
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,359
plants in the basement or for you know

945
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:01,679
hundreds or thousands of plants in a

946
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:03,199
facility and each one of these carrots

947
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,480
is going to go into each one of the

948
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:07,039
containers and they're going to produce

949
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,039
extremely consistent results from

950
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:11,279
container to container so without any

951
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,679
real dialing in process you're going to

952
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,200
hit uh extremely consistent moisture

953
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,719
levels for every container in the space

954
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:20,759
whether it's 6 or

955
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:23,959
600 and then you can you can then

956
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:26,480
manipulate the moisture levels um just

957
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,400
by changing the backend uh uh pressure

958
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,119
on the system so if the pressure going

959
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:35,680
into the system is you know it say it's

960
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:38,000
coming in at 15 psi and everything in

961
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:39,719
the room is at like 40 mbars and you

962
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,800
want to kind of dry that out to like you

963
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:44,199
know 60 mbars as your low low low end

964
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,280
you would just drop that backend

965
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:48,919
pressure down to like you know 7 PSI and

966
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,119
that's going to automatically drop like

967
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,599
change the moisture level of every every

968
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,480
pot or every container in the in the

969
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,599
space

970
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:02,079
um and you you know it seems like a

971
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:05,720
simple thing but it's really

972
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,800
revolutionized the success uh of for for

973
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:09,000
Growers that are doing it because it

974
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,519
takes the human error part on someone

975
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,679
that's new to using blue mats um just

976
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:16,358
right right out of the equation um so

977
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:18,759
that human error part just kind of

978
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:21,639
becomes becomes a much less of a

979
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:23,079
factor um and it makes the whole systems

980
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:25,598
way more kind of plug andplay you don't

981
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:27,920
get the kind of overwatering that might

982
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,400
have have come or or flooded or anything

983
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,800
like that with with you know setting the

984
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,880
the blue mats incorrectly and getting

985
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,680
over watering that's been eliminated

986
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,519
with this process um and then really

987
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:41,838
just redesigning the water distribution

988
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:45,400
piece so I mentioned these the drip

989
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:47,759
Rings um we have them in a a 5 in and uh

990
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,960
and in a 10 in also so like you know

991
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,400
anything up to like a 5 gallon pot would

992
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,440
go with the 5 in and then kind of your

993
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,400
like 10 gallons up to 30 gallons would

994
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:00,599
go with one of these 10in rings so so in

995
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,039
um you know one of the one of the

996
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:06,119
carrots with one of these drip rings per

997
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:09,400
container uh is is like it's a great way

998
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:11,240
to be really really consistent and give

999
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,358
good water distribution nice and even

1000
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:15,639
moisture levels in the soil and then

1001
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:17,159
have them operating within those

1002
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:20,000
moisture ranges that we were talking

1003
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:22,078
about like a narrow wetter band during

1004
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:27,440
veg and then during flower a little bit

1005
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:30,079
more of a swing of of wet dry um overall

1006
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,200
uh so yeah I mean I would

1007
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,240
say I would say that's like a big

1008
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:37,318
advancement we've we've uh assembled a

1009
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:40,078
new pump kit that um we just started

1010
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:40,960
releasing like two months ago um people

1011
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,720
might have seen them they have a nice

1012
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,079
blue tank and a and a and a pump

1013
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:46,559
integrated right on top of it um and it

1014
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:48,440
comes with this adjustable pressure

1015
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:51,039
reducer which is a new product that

1016
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,960
we've integrated into the system so that

1017
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:54,639
um you can you can again adjust that

1018
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,480
backend pressure of the system just at

1019
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:59,759
one place so the pressure reducer itself

1020
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,318
has a dial on it that you can turn and

1021
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,440
drop the pressure and watch the pressure

1022
00:41:01,318 --> 00:41:05,599
drop on your pressure gauge uh that's

1023
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,480
mounted on it and you know with with

1024
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,800
that new pump kit with the adjustable

1025
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:13,280
pressure reducer with the pre- dialed

1026
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:16,960
carrots um and the drip rings for pots

1027
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,280
or our manifold beds

1028
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:23,400
uh with the soaker hose for raised beds

1029
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,280
um you know this this system we've we've

1030
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,358
taken like we've done like so many

1031
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,880
different systems that are experimental

1032
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:29,838
and like maybe we're going to try it

1033
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,200
like this we're going to try it like

1034
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:34,960
this what's working I feel you know

1035
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,159
after hammering away at this stuff for

1036
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,000
six or seven years now we've we've

1037
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:41,799
gotten to a place where we have a really

1038
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,480
awesome kind of line of really simple

1039
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:48,280
designs that are scalable and um

1040
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,800
consistent with what they're going to

1041
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,280
deliver and um we're actually like in

1042
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,599
the process of like revamping our

1043
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:57,359
website right now so that we can um

1044
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,160
we're going to have a a sustainable

1045
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:03,480
village.com there'll be a um a build

1046
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:05,519
your own blue mat system and a page

1047
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,679
there it's not quite functional yet as

1048
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:10,119
were recording this but I'm hoping in a

1049
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:11,639
couple weeks it will be um and for the

1050
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:14,079
smaller systems you know for up to like

1051
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:16,039
a 10 x10 growth space you could go in

1052
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,800
there really easily and customize your

1053
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:18,960
own system and just order it right

1054
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,680
online without even really having to

1055
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,800
talk to anybody and you're going to get

1056
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:24,598
a you're going to get a package in the

1057
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:27,680
mail that has everything you need from

1058
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:29,240
from pumps to supply lines to um

1059
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,919
to the to the carrots themselves and the

1060
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:35,919
water distribution um so that that kind

1061
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,800
of like Suite of technology and services

1062
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,039
we've been working on for pretty much

1063
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:43,280
consistently since the last time we

1064
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:44,880
talked two years ago on this show and um

1065
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,839
has gotten to a point where We've ran

1066
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,440
through you know like a year of pilot

1067
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:52,078
programs with with hom Growers and

1068
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:55,000
commercial facilities um gotten gotten

1069
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,680
feedback made some adjustments and and

1070
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,318
now we have like I said that that kind

1071
00:42:56,679 --> 00:43:02,440
of like sweet of products that and and

1072
00:42:59,318 --> 00:43:04,880
and designs and Tech to uh to give

1073
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:09,519
people like a awesome experience from

1074
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:12,039
irrigation uh perspective and you know

1075
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,679
like I'm a water nerd and an irrigation

1076
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:16,119
guy and like so for me it's really

1077
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:17,440
exciting especially to take like take

1078
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:21,200
problem points that were like man these

1079
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,519
are this is real pain in the butt and um

1080
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:25,439
put those

1081
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:28,159
into uh you really solve those pain

1082
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,400
points and and get a and get get um a

1083
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:32,920
design out that's that's easy and makes

1084
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,920
people successful and it's going to

1085
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,159
result in you know significant yield

1086
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,920
increases and healthier plants and way

1087
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:40,440
more free time and that's the Innovation

1088
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,960
you were talking about earlier you know

1089
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,200
it definitely sounds like it makes

1090
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:47,079
things easier for the end consumer and

1091
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:48,879
uh less mistakes happen you know I know

1092
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:51,079
a lot of people who get the blue mats

1093
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,800
and just dialing it in it's that little

1094
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:55,318
tinkering that needs to get done it's

1095
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,160
It's Tricky for them so having a precept

1096
00:43:55,318 --> 00:43:59,599
blue mat is uh pretty awesome I do have

1097
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:00,879
a question in regards to that I think I

1098
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,559
know the answer to it but I'm still

1099
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,920
going to ask know you have it dialed in

1100
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:07,880
it's preset so it's it's Watering your

1101
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,480
plant as it needs if you want to add in

1102
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,400
say microbes for example so you have

1103
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,280
like a/4 gallon or half gallon of water

1104
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,559
and you just pour it right on the top of

1105
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,160
the medium so it's going to make that

1106
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:20,319
Medium more moist right more wet so it's

1107
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:23,118
going to lower the Miller bars right now

1108
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:26,480
is it going to throw off the preset blue

1109
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,760
mat or is it going to dry back to that

1110
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,519
certain range that it's in as far as

1111
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,760
moisture level yeah no you're you're

1112
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:33,800
answering your own question it will it

1113
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,079
will not throw off the preset blue mat

1114
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,680
so like your questions about liquid

1115
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:40,519
inputs and um it's really really common

1116
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:42,358
way to do things is to run clean water

1117
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:44,280
through the blue mats and then if you

1118
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:46,159
want to do an a liquid input like a like

1119
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,440
a compost tea drench or just a nutrient

1120
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:50,759
drench or anything like that uh that's

1121
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,440
fine that's no problem at all um you'll

1122
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,960
just you will bring the moisture level

1123
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,838
down um or you know it'll it'll become

1124
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,800
more wet uh for for a short amount of

1125
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:02,400
time but the blue mat will just turn off

1126
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,200
and it'll stay off until it dries back

1127
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,480
to its trigger point so the trigger

1128
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:07,118
point is really about when does a blue

1129
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,760
mat turn on and then when does it turn

1130
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:13,079
off

1131
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:15,000
and um that is uh yeah so no it doesn't

1132
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:17,800
affect it is the is the short answer

1133
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,760
there and I think you you nailed it okay

1134
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:22,240
and then you also talked about PSI and I

1135
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,920
know there's some folks that are hooking

1136
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:26,159
it up to their spet for example and

1137
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,079
they're doing it like have an outdoor

1138
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:30,679
setup and they have a a pressure reducer

1139
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,720
so they're dialing that PSI to to 15 or

1140
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:34,598
whatever they set it to right but a lot

1141
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:36,078
of folks are growing indoors and they're

1142
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:37,960
just doing the gravity Fed so they're

1143
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,200
hooked up to a reservoir so they don't

1144
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,358
really have control over that PSI in a

1145
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:44,960
sense now in our last episode we talked

1146
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:47,880
about you had mentioned that when you're

1147
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:50,599
setting those blue mats it's best to

1148
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:53,039
have your Reservoir half full and then

1149
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:55,440
dial it in that way when it lowers

1150
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:57,719
you're kind of getting less pressure or

1151
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,519
you if you increase the amount that's in

1152
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:02,039
the reservoir that's a different

1153
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:03,920
pressure as well now will that throw off

1154
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:06,119
the preset blue mats to to the folks

1155
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,720
that are doing gravity fed should they

1156
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:09,960
have their Reservoir half full then

1157
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:11,279
install the preset blue mats or does

1158
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,159
that not matter anymore because it's

1159
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,119
it's preset well what you do there

1160
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:16,598
because exactly right because really

1161
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,720
what you're doing for your water source

1162
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:18,880
when you look at your water source you

1163
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:20,279
have a few different options you can

1164
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,358
either come right off of a pressurized

1165
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,440
water source like a hose bib and go

1166
00:46:22,358 --> 00:46:27,679
straight into a pressure reducer and

1167
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:30,960
knock that down to to 15 psi anywhere

1168
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:32,719
from 15 to 2 PSI um you can use a pump

1169
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,800
kit like a pre-assembled pump kit that's

1170
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:35,558
basically going to do the same thing

1171
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,720
it's going to create a constant water

1172
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:39,760
sources under constant pressure run that

1173
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:41,199
through another pressure reducer or

1174
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,200
through a pressure reducer and kind of

1175
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:45,480
hit that same consistent level or you

1176
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:50,358
can M you can achieve that constant

1177
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:53,800
pressure with a with gravity so um you

1178
00:46:50,358 --> 00:46:58,519
know the calculation for that is uh uh 1

1179
00:46:53,800 --> 00:47:03,680
psi equals 2.31 ft of vertical head so

1180
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:05,800
for every 2.31 ft of of vertical um

1181
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:08,558
elevation that that the water is above

1182
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,519
the soil surface that's one PSI so we

1183
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,440
like to see about two PSI to get good

1184
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:14,880
uniform operation it'll they will

1185
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:17,559
function closer to one PSI but I'd like

1186
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,960
to see two um so three or five feet you

1187
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:22,519
know four to five feet of head um yeah

1188
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,880
you can just do that you can uh you can

1189
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:26,159
use a a 5 gallon bucket that's like a a

1190
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,358
popular thing we send out these bucket

1191
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:29,199
kits you can use

1192
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:30,920
a plastic tote from Home Depot or

1193
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:32,480
whatever just drill a little hole in it

1194
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,159
and put a little a bulkhead in it and

1195
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,358
then run off that and um have your

1196
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:38,199
supply line creating that kind of

1197
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:41,078
constant pressure and as far as the

1198
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:44,799
preset carrots goes um I'll pop this top

1199
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:47,240
off again the uh there's like I said

1200
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,880
there's there's a blue mark on it and

1201
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:52,279
there's a red mark on it and these are

1202
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,480
all in relation to this there's a

1203
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:57,480
plastic fin right there on the top and

1204
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,000
so when you're when your backend

1205
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,280
pressure is higher like with off a

1206
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,318
pressure reducer you're going to put it

1207
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,559
towards that blue Mark when it's drier

1208
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:06,279
or when it's when the lower pressure

1209
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,760
like a 2psi like off of Gravity you're

1210
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,119
just going to want to turn that to the

1211
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:13,119
to the red mark and like I said these

1212
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:16,480
things come with this plastic cap

1213
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,400
snapped over the top as protective cap

1214
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,880
and there's actually a little key that

1215
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,519
we have now too I don't have one sitting

1216
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,079
here but um there's a little key that

1217
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:26,119
that inserts into this hole and then you

1218
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,760
can just turn it and you just move that

1219
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:30,880
between the blue and the red um to do

1220
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,240
that without having remove the cap so

1221
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,160
you know if you are running a gravity

1222
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:36,078
system they're going to come set with

1223
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:37,679
the at the blue mark But if you're

1224
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,559
running the gravity you just adjust it

1225
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:43,519
so that that the red mark is lining up

1226
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:45,200
with that plastic fin piece there and um

1227
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,719
we have some really nice uh you know

1228
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:48,838
kind of like infographic style

1229
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:51,239
instructions that go along with this

1230
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:54,440
that'll that will show how to manipulate

1231
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:56,318
that um and also a chart that's that's

1232
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,798
part of it too that'll show you know you

1233
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:59,039
look at your backend pressure and the

1234
00:48:57,798 --> 00:49:00,960
moisture levels you want to hit and then

1235
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:03,119
where to adjust it within that range

1236
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,679
between the red and the blue Mark so

1237
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,559
yeah that's for for Gravity systems we

1238
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:08,279
would just move it towards the red mark

1239
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,319
nice yeah it sounds like it makes things

1240
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,319
a lot easier for the hom grower and I'm

1241
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:14,440
all about easy so I have to see if I can

1242
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:16,199
get my hands on on those things so what

1243
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,798
other advancements in irrigation

1244
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:19,879
technology do you anticipate in the

1245
00:49:17,798 --> 00:49:21,519
future so what what we're doing with the

1246
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,798
blue mats and and we we do this with

1247
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:25,639
other things too and other people do it

1248
00:49:22,798 --> 00:49:28,000
it's that that kind of that sort of Holy

1249
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:32,838
Grail of irrigation is is all about

1250
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:35,798
plant demand irrigation so using some

1251
00:49:32,838 --> 00:49:38,159
sort of sensor to trigger irrigation

1252
00:49:35,798 --> 00:49:41,159
events and again that's really happening

1253
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:44,838
with the blue mats um I would say that

1254
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:46,719
the like the place where where the blue

1255
00:49:44,838 --> 00:49:49,599
matat isn't as effective as in like

1256
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:51,358
large scale outdoor applications um

1257
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,760
because because of some of the flow

1258
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:56,279
rates involved um some of the materials

1259
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,280
involved are a little more prone to

1260
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:01,000
invol like UV degradation or like they

1261
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,839
get chewed up by animals and things like

1262
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,358
that um anybody that's growing Outdoors

1263
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:07,358
we have strategies for coping with all

1264
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:09,679
of that if they're in containers but

1265
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:11,639
they but work if you're in direct soil

1266
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:12,558
like um native soil applications things

1267
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:15,480
like that the blue mats aren't

1268
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:18,960
necessarily the best choice so you know

1269
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:20,039
I see just the evolution of sensors you

1270
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,519
know there's like all kinds of different

1271
00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:24,798
moisture sensors out there whether the

1272
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:26,400
volumetric ones um or tensiometer based

1273
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:29,318
ones or there's there's a Third Kind

1274
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,200
called the solid Matrix um sensors which

1275
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:33,920
are a type of tensiometers that are used

1276
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:35,798
in uh clay soils like clay based soils

1277
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,760
like you would use outside in a in a

1278
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:39,000
large scale field or something like that

1279
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:43,280
I mean some of the stuff I'm excited

1280
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:46,838
about is like completely not related to

1281
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,640
um you know that that indoor industry

1282
00:50:46,838 --> 00:50:51,759
that we've been talking about um it's

1283
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:55,199
more like in the regenerative a space we

1284
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:58,000
do I I designed systems using a product

1285
00:50:55,199 --> 00:51:00,199
called K kfco Water re they these large

1286
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,199
water guns that can water anywhere from

1287
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:06,318
like 1 to 60 Acres at a time and that's

1288
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:08,798
like a it's a larger amount of space

1289
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:10,719
right in general um but it's not as

1290
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:12,639
large as like a center pivot irrigation

1291
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,919
piece so I mean this is just a pet

1292
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:16,838
project of mine that and I'm working on

1293
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:20,358
with uh some some of the people in the

1294
00:51:16,838 --> 00:51:22,558
regenerative a community but uh you know

1295
00:51:20,358 --> 00:51:23,679
when you fly over United States or

1296
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,640
anywhere and you see all the center

1297
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:28,279
pivots so you look down at the field and

1298
00:51:25,639 --> 00:51:29,960
you see these uh these large circles

1299
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,760
with then they have brown in the corners

1300
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,159
where they're not growing anything

1301
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,280
because the center pivots are just like

1302
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:35,879
that's what they are they're a giant

1303
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,760
sprinkler that just like operates on a

1304
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:40,119
big boom arm and spins around in a

1305
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,760
circle and that leaves these corners of

1306
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:45,640
the fields uh

1307
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,559
uncultivated and um yeah something I'm

1308
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:50,480
just kind of getting kicked off and as

1309
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:52,160
like a side project on my own is is is

1310
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,079
is irrigating those corners and and

1311
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:57,879
putting those into regenerative

1312
00:51:54,079 --> 00:52:00,599
agricultural practices that can be um uh

1313
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:03,358
ecosystems for and Native habitats for

1314
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:05,640
for pollinators and for for uh plants

1315
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:07,519
and animals that um will benefit the

1316
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:10,279
larger ecosystems and even the monocrops

1317
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:11,960
that are that are being grown there um

1318
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,079
for carbon sequestration all these sort

1319
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,400
of like the benefits of regenerative a

1320
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,839
there's a ton of there's like just

1321
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,720
thousands and thousands of acres of land

1322
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:20,159
out there that's not being used because

1323
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:23,039
they can't hit them with those Center

1324
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:25,879
pivots so we're putting together some

1325
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:27,400
designs to uh irrigate those those the

1326
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,440
corners like you know the corners of the

1327
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,358
fields um again that's kind of outside

1328
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,880
of it that's something I'm excited about

1329
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:35,639
as a as a as a designer and someone

1330
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,599
that's like you know passionate about

1331
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:38,879
regenerative EG in general yeah and then

1332
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,880
you know and then in the controlled

1333
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:44,358
environment space like yeah it's just

1334
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:47,079
the evolution of sensors um the drip

1335
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:50,358
irrigation companies that we work with

1336
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:53,000
uh like irch rivulus neim those kind of

1337
00:52:50,358 --> 00:52:56,159
companies you know they're all

1338
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,559
producing some new technology uh in drip

1339
00:52:56,159 --> 00:53:01,598
IR ation a lot of it's you know it's not

1340
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:02,920
super Innovative but there's some new

1341
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,920
stuff that comes out periodically and

1342
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,039
they get better quality products so kind

1343
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,599
of cool to see that come out but yeah I

1344
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:11,480
think like the sensors and the data

1345
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:13,400
that's produced and um a lot of that's

1346
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,199
now being integrated with like you know

1347
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,519
cloud-based technology so you'll have

1348
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:19,118
like aerometer we we sell a lot of those

1349
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:20,639
like aerometer makes a tensiometer it's

1350
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:23,760
similar to the blue matat digital moist

1351
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:25,480
meter but um it that you can connect it

1352
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,160
back to this Hub that has a SIM card in

1353
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:30,199
it and that that shoots up data to a

1354
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:32,159
cloud and you can go on your browser and

1355
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:33,279
see like real time uh it's not really

1356
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:35,399
real time they give it it's like every

1357
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:38,119
hour they give a data set but you can

1358
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,599
see historical moisture data for a field

1359
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:41,079
um or you can put them indoors too and

1360
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,880
see that over time in your in your

1361
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:46,119
indoor grow um but uh yeah just

1362
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,599
collecting more and more data and

1363
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:49,760
getting more sophisticated with the

1364
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,280
application of water and nutrients so

1365
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,520
that we're never using too much and

1366
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:57,040
we're never overwatering or over

1367
00:53:54,519 --> 00:54:00,000
fertilizing um to kind of create healthy

1368
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:02,039
soils and ecosystems nice yeah the

1369
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,798
moisture level having the data for that

1370
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:05,358
kind of reminds me of the Eco wit

1371
00:54:03,798 --> 00:54:07,280
moisture meter not sure if you're

1372
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:08,719
familiar with that one or not but uh

1373
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,160
that one basically connects to an app

1374
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:12,759
and it gives you that display right

1375
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:14,118
there so you could have multiple all see

1376
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,440
it right there now one thing that would

1377
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:16,760
be really cool and maybe this already

1378
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,358
exists and I don't know about it but

1379
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,839
what if that was connected to like a

1380
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:22,920
blue mat for example and you could set

1381
00:54:20,838 --> 00:54:25,199
on your app what moisture level you

1382
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:27,798
wanted and then it would adjust

1383
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:29,639
automatically yeah Eco is a volumetric

1384
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:32,679
water sensor so that's measuring that

1385
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:34,879
percentage of water in the soil and you

1386
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:38,759
know if you have done enough of the math

1387
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:40,559
and kind of calculations to you can um

1388
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,960
strategize your irrigation events based

1389
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,480
on those numbers um you have to like be

1390
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:48,039
more familiar with the soil types and

1391
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,599
blah blah blah um and then I know those

1392
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:51,119
are really popular and I you know I

1393
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,838
think people have good results with them

1394
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,640
they're they're kind of on the lower end

1395
00:54:52,838 --> 00:54:57,279
of the spectrum of like sensitivity and

1396
00:54:55,639 --> 00:54:59,480
and functionality that sort of thing

1397
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:03,200
there's some other brands like tarot

1398
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:04,719
sensor or um someone call acclima and

1399
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:06,639
these are like kind of more higher end

1400
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:10,039
lab grade ones that that give really

1401
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:14,039
specific results but that's exactly how

1402
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:19,159
uh you know a lot of Growers will will

1403
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:20,880
do crop steering within um uh like Hydro

1404
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:22,519
systems if they're in rock wall so

1405
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,000
they'll have like those their prongs and

1406
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:26,559
they'll have a biometric water sensor in

1407
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,760
the rock wall and it's giving it once it

1408
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:30,599
hits a certain trigger point it'll it'll

1409
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:33,319
open a solenoid valve and it'll irrigate

1410
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:34,359
every piece of rock wall and then it'll

1411
00:55:33,318 --> 00:55:38,480
up to a certain point and then it'll

1412
00:55:34,358 --> 00:55:40,798
turn itself off um so yeah that does

1413
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,798
that that that Tech is is out there I

1414
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:44,159
think that it's there's ton there's a

1415
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,358
lot of people doing some really cool

1416
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:48,279
stuff and that are they're building

1417
00:55:46,358 --> 00:55:50,358
better systems better sensors better

1418
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:53,000
platforms for like looking at that

1419
00:55:50,358 --> 00:55:56,000
information and hooking it up to the

1420
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,639
water distribution system itself um so

1421
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,400
yeah we seen some seen some cool cool

1422
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:05,519
things like that I like you know that's

1423
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,838
great and when I I'm more of an AGM

1424
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:10,639
minded irrigation guy anyway so like I

1425
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:14,119
try to go towards Simplicity I I think

1426
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:15,400
that Growers have created technology

1427
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:18,160
problems for themselves that they don't

1428
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:21,200
necessarily need by like getting too

1429
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:24,759
complex with uh with some of those

1430
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:27,078
systems but you know if if if you have

1431
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,400
the bandwidth and the budget to to

1432
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:30,599
implement that sort of thing it can be

1433
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,920
really effective I completely agree with

1434
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:33,599
you and it's kind of funny sometimes

1435
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,838
hearing you've got people on both sides

1436
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:38,240
some people are like um handw watering

1437
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:40,119
be with the plants know the plants

1438
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:42,639
versus Automation and kind of being

1439
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:44,720
hands off and being the garden less you

1440
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:47,118
know so whichever way you decide to go

1441
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:48,519
about it that's up to you I overall

1442
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:51,039
think it's exciting to see this

1443
00:56:48,519 --> 00:56:52,920
technology in this space and I'm a

1444
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:54,960
person who would actually implement it

1445
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,400
in my garden without losing touch of the

1446
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,960
plants you know I I love getting in

1447
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,440
there and breathing on the plants giving

1448
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,519
some fresh CO2 you know but now good

1449
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,838
stuff a lot to look forward to but

1450
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:05,440
appreciate you coming on today for the

1451
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:06,759
second time can you tell the listeners

1452
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,599
