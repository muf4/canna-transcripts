questions this week i want to give a

14
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,799
quick shout out to our sponsor ac

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,119
infiniti is sponsoring this episode

16
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,039
their clip-on oscillating fan is now

17
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,439
released i've been using their six-inch

18
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,519
version for over six months now and i

19
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,759
absolutely love it it's easy to clip on

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,600
the side of my grow tent and it has 10

21
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,839
different speeds which makes it easy to

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,920
control air circulation they do also

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,079
have non-oscillating versions of these

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,920
clip-on fans these fans are currently in

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,558
high demand when they sell out of the

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,640
fans which i expect them to often you

27

what's the best at-home

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,079
ipm solution of my best at home ipm

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,359
solution i use neem oil you know some

37
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:26,478
controversy behind neem oil but i do use

38
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:29,759
neem i use yellow stickies as a form of

39
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:32,158
ipm i use essential oils basically my

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,759
recipe is i use a lot of like rosemary

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,840
and peppermint is usually what i use for

42
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,680
essential oils and i'll take about 32

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,680
ounces of water a little bit of either

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,680
dish soap or dr bronner's soap i think

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,079
it's usually about a teaspoon of it that

46
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,720
i put in there and then a few drops i

47
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:50,478
think it's like up to five drops of

48
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:52,719
rosemary or peppermint essential oil and

49
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,719
uh you know shake that up spray it onto

50
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,599
the plants and that has worked pretty

51
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,000
good and rotating it around so doing

52
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,000
rosemary one week next week for example

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,078
the week after that doing a neem week

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,599
one week two weeks after that switching

55
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,359
up doing peppermint and then kind of

56
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,919
going back and rotating around but those

57
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:12,000
are the three main things that i do as

58
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,439
far as sprays and then also you know

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,120
yellow stickies like i talked about

60
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,120
which is a part of ipm right it's a

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,759
preventative measure cleaning the

62
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,680
grosgram i clean before i start the

63
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,159
grill and i like to do a thorough

64
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,879
cleaning when i transition to a flower

65
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,318
if i can if my plants aren't just too

66
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,560
crowded in there if i'm able to remove

67
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,639
the plants from my grow tent for example

68
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,479
i'll do a nice thorough cleaning before

69
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,079
going into flower as well so trying to

70
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,560
think of this anything else that i do

71
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,160
for ipm really yeah that's those are the

72
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,360
main things that i can think of up top

73
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:45,840
my head when to harvest seeds after the

74
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,560
plant runs its life and dies or at

75
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,719
regular harvest time on trichomes great

76
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,640
question granny grower good to see you

77
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,560
here hope all has been well with you so

78
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,799
i'm actually doing a seed run right now

79
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,840
for those of you that don't know i did a

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,239
cross brisk rogi across with pakistan

81
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,759
valley it is named chillout og i'm

82
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,680
actually all the way down to a market on

83
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,359
getting an f3 right now i just harvested

84
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,439
a bunch of plants the offspring of those

85
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,400
plants are f3 generation so it's

86
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,759
inbreeding that's being done basically

87
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,959
from all i learned and i don't have a

88
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,639
ton of knowledge when it comes to

89
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,959
breeding but from my understanding you

90
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,039
want to kind of keep the plant healthy

91
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,959
all the way up until harvest

92
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,439
specifically when you're doing a seed

93
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,519
run like that healthy plant results in

94
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,919
healthy seeds so

95
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,158
general answer for you would be get the

96
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,479
plant all the way up until it's starting

97
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,719
to kind of kill itself off at least in

98
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,798
my opinion start to like kill itself off

99
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,479
this might be at harvest time or a

100
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,319
little bit after you would normally

101
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,798
harvest in my experience it's usually a

102
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:47,039
week or two after sometimes even more

103
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,959
after your typical harvest that you

104
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,318
would do on just a female plant for

105
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,959
example where you're just harvesting the

106
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,359
buds but if the plant starts to decay

107
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,360
die off that's what i've been harvesting

108
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,400
and then and then it hasn't been any

109
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,319
impact on

110
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,719
seeds you know beautiful seeds i've been

111
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:05,039
i've gotten off this run so i think that

112
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,438
pretty much answers your question ph

113
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,840
your water in organic living soil

114
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,400
especially when using tap water which is

115
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,239
8 ph from the start yeah i would

116
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,478
recommend it you know i would definitely

117
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,079
recommend it sometimes my water comes

118
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,159
out above seven

119
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,240
seven point two seven point four it's

120
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,400
because i have a lot of bicarbonates in

121
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,840
my water a lot of bicarbonates increases

122
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:29,839
the ph so if you have a high source of

123
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,239
ph to begin i would definitely recommend

124
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:35,119
lowering it if you're using

125
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,680
tap water well water something that has

126
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,280
some sort of minerals in it a ppm in it

127
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,000
you know it could be as low as like 40

128
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:46,399
ppm or 100 ppm it won't drift down as

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,800
much when you're using the ph up

130
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,638
ph down solution you know so phosphoric

131
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,800
acid or whatever you're using for ph

132
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,360
down if you're using ro

133
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,120
it only takes like a couple drops to

134
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,600
drop it down like i'm doing two or three

135
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,600
drops less than a milliliter but uh when

136
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,520
i'm using tap water i went back when i

137
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,639
used to tap water at one point and i had

138
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,719
485 ppm so i'm using a lot of ph down in

139
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,560
order to adjust it down so just be

140
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,840
careful there but yeah if you're

141
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,120
continuing

142
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:18,560
watering in your organic living soil at

143
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:22,319
like 7.5 or 8 ph or just a

144
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,639
higher ph above seven generally speaking

145
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,599
it could cause problems so if your

146
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,400
living soil is like if you you're the ph

147
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,600
of your medium is 6.0 for example or

148
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:36,159
let's say it's 6.3 if you're watering in

149
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,960
at a significantly higher ph you're

150
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,280
disrupting the microbial life in your

151
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,959
living soil system so a lot of them are

152
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,679
actually getting killed off because the

153
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,000
ph is being adjusted so rapidly so i

154
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,680
totally recommend that you know for that

155
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,680
as one reason to lower the ph ph adjust

156
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,519
it before giving it to your your living

157
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,959
soil system so even in organics even

158
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,959
when you're growing organically to help

159
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,799
prevent that harm from happening to the

160
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,478
the microbes down there another reason

161
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,478
why is because there's nutrients that

162
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,439
aren't available for uptake that high

163
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:10,560
iron is a good example of that basically

164
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:13,680
if it's over 6.5 ph plant isn't able to

165
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,240
uptake iron and so what happens is it's

166
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,759
a different form of iron in the medium

167
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,120
when the ph is that high and the plant

168
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,439
isn't able to uptake it so you need to

169
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,519
lower it in order to actually get it

170
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,120
into a form that the plant is able to

171
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,758
uptake another thing that the plant will

172
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,160
do is it'll actually release acids so uh

173
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,759
it'll excrete acids out of its root in

174
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,400
order to lower the ph so it can uptake

175
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,400
iron for example so yeah those high ph's

176
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,478
you just got to be careful i wouldn't

177
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,918
water in above seven i tried not to

178
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:45,758
water in above seven seven okay but if i

179
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,680
can lower it down to the sixes i'll

180
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,800
definitely do that how would you advise

181
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,800
a grower new to autos on how to feed

182
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,840
them as in how much on the different

183
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,478
stages of life so

184
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,918
that's actually my book shameless plug

185
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,159
here's my book

186
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,079
uh it's on amazon feel free to pick it

187
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,240
up link in the description section below

188
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:09,359
there's a section here on ppm which i

189
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,360
will read to you real quick page 68. so

190
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,840
autos photos it's going to depend on

191
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,038
genetics right so some could be these

192
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,439
ranges right here just going to be

193
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:19,199
general ranges you can certainly go

194
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,598
higher lower and the plant may be

195
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,319
healthy so after sprout first week in

196
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:27,038
vegetation stage 100 to 250 ppm this is

197
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,080
a 500 scale ppm is what i'm talking

198
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:32,478
about veg weeks 2 and 3 300 to 400 ppm

199
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:35,519
veg weeks four and beyond anywhere from

200
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:37,199
450 to 700 ppm sometimes it could take a

201
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,038
little higher especially when you've got

202
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,319
bigger plants flowers week one through

203
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:45,439
four 750 to 950 flowers week five and

204
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,199
beyond 1000 to sixteen hundred ppm so

205
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,639
that's usually what i stick by like i

206
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,478
mentioned some plants are going to be

207
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,240
able to take more than that some plants

208
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,318
will be able will still be healthy with

209
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,160
less than that so those are just general

210
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,319
ranges that you can stick by but try it

211
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,960
out and as far as autos being different

212
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,199
than photos as far as feeding there's a

213
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,839
lot of controversy behind that my

214
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,360
opinion on it is that the differences

215
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,079
are going to be minimal depending on

216
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,560
genetics have you smoked the freak show

217
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,639
yet yes i have actually released an

218
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,360
update video on that the harvest video

219
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,840
on that and i smoked some of it a strong

220
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,080
lime flavor definitely hint of gas some

221
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,839
sweetness to it pretty good pretty good

222
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,918
i wasn't thrilled with the bud structure

223
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,839
you know i wish it was more dense some

224
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,839
can say that it's my environment that's

225
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,079
causing that and somebody had mentioned

226
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,879
that it's an outdoor cultivar and it is

227
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,680
better for lower temps specifically in

228
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:40,240
the flowering stage i ran it at like 81

229
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,918
82 degrees fahrenheit and it's just the

230
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,599
bud structure i think i think that

231
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,000
impacted it really but yeah it's pretty

232
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,160
good smoke what's one cut you wish you

233
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,200
had mothered i would have to say

234
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:54,079
queen anne's revenge by subcool seeds

235
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,640
formerly tga genetics i had a beautiful

236
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,240
pheno of this one i remember exactly

237
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,919
it's on my grow series actually if you

238
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,000
dig back on my channel way back i think

239
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,479
it was like 2017 or something cringe

240
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,919
videos back then but the plant ended up

241
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,320
being like i had like magnesium

242
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:10,319
deficiency like early on in the grow i

243
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,360
was still in veg if i remember correctly

244
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,278
it was easy to recover very easy feeder

245
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,919
somewhat of a heavier feeder when it

246
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:19,838
grew all the like in flowering all the

247
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,599
buds were super dense all the way down

248
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,760
the plant trichomes were covered all the

249
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,360
way down even those bottom little buds

250
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,439
at the bottom they weren't really larf

251
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,080
they were hard buds with a large amount

252
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,279
of trichomes and towards the end of

253
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,240
flowering it ended up slowly changing

254
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:38,159
color from top to bottom it was like a

255
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,919
dark purple and it slowly worked its way

256
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,759
down so each day i'd open up the grow

257
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,679
tent and it would be purple up top and

258
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,679
then next day a little bit more

259
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,199
lower lower and then the whole plant was

260
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:49,278
just completely covered and actually did

261
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,879
a partial harvest on this plant snipped

262
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,200
off those top branches and i was going

263
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,958
to lower the light and let that bottom

264
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,680
part of the plant ripen some more and

265
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,199
after i harvested those top branches it

266
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,958
uncovered some leaves that weren't

267
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,040
hidden hit by the light and they were

268
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,599
like a beautiful green color made them

269
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,240
look like a a lime green color almost

270
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,680
because the purple was so dark you'd

271
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,200
have to dig back in my videos to see

272
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,958
what i'm talking about but it just

273
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,120
looked absolutely beautiful with a mix

274
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,278
of colors there and then the smoke don't

275
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,360
really remember what the flavor was but

276
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,200
i do remember a very narcotic effect

277
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,240
something that just really made me chill

278
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,320
out zonk out pouch lock and uh that's

279
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,600
the one that got away that is the one

280
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,440
that got away so yeah i wish i wish i

281
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,440
kept that as a mother because uh those

282
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,399
were some really really good genetics

283
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,959
how much you mixing craft to fox so i

284
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,679
assume what you mean is how much craft

285
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,919
blend am i mixing in with the fox farm

286
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,159
ocean forest soil to begin i'm not

287
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,559
mixing any in so i'm taking foxhole

288
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:51,679
motion for soil from the bag having my

289
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,679
plants in there for 30 days and then top

290
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,159
dressing at that 30 day mark with the

291
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,919
build cell craft blend one cup per plant

292
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,240
and then sometimes i'll add in some

293
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,838
worm castings along with it help boost

294
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,759
up the microbe life how many times do

295
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,000
you pot up photos i've done it so many

296
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,759
different ways started in solos went to

297
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,440
ones went to threes started in solos

298
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,600
went to ones went to five started in

299
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,160
solos went to ones went to sevens i've

300
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,399
really been liking starting in ones one

301
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,719
gallon containers letting it grow for

302
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,720
about 30 days or so shaping it as best

303
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,160
as possible full-blown training and then

304
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,079
transferring it to a seven gallon

305
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,319
container and a lot of you know me i

306
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,679
like to keep my plants smaller i'm just

307
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,360
growing for myself i don't need this

308
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,799
large plant so shortly after

309
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,560
transplanting i'm flipping over to

310
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,799
flowering and it actually has been

311
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,719
maintaining just about just about to the

312
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,000
end of flowering the nutrients that are

313
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,320
in that seven gallon container have

314
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,600
lasted the remainder of the grill that's

315
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,040
my favorite way to go about it just

316
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,800
because it's a little bit easier i've

317
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,039
been trying to use organics in five

318
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,639
gallon pots i feel like my feed times

319
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,439
come around it's already lacking a bit

320
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,838
could this be a sign i should maybe use

321
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,320
seven gallons to be honest ever since i

322
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,000
switched to organics i've tried organics

323
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,600
in 30 gallons i've tried organics in

324
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,440
five gallons i've gotten the best

325
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,560
results off of the seven gallons it's

326
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,320
been a lot easier being able to have a

327
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,919
seven gallon with all those nutrients in

328
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,079
there having the roots be able to spread

329
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,519
out as they do it was just a lot easier

330
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:12,958
being in that larger container and i

331
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,600
might even go up to a 10 gallon

332
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,599
container soon but right now i have four

333
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,200
seven gallon containers that are living

334
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,278
soil and i've been using them grow after

335
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,920
grow up to grow i think i'm on my fourth

336
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:25,838
grow with them maybe third grow with

337
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,719
them reusing that same soil and seven

338
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,600
gallons and each time i just amend with

339
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,278
well

340
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,200
it varies a little bit but build a soil

341
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,600
craft blend is one example where i'll

342
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,120
put a cup in that seven gallon container

343
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,519
then i'll plant my seed in there and

344
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,120
then every 30 days i'm doing another top

345
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,480
dressing of that one cup of craft blend

346
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,799
that's just one example you know earth

347
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,639
dust nutrients or you can use other

348
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,559
nutrient line there's so many different

349
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,919
ways to go about it but i think you

350
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,399
would be happy in a seven gallon

351
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,958
container try it out how are the peppers

352
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,120
melons going growing anything else yeah

353
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,518
so i have a two foot by 10 foot living

354
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,000
soil bed in my backyard i have two

355
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,000
varieties of peppers going right now

356
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,559
i've got let's see one two three four

357
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,440
five plants of peppers and then three

358
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,799
plants of melons melons is a maduros i

359
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,959
think i'm pronouncing that right i think

360
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,120
it's from india and

361
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,838
high temperatures is what it thrives in

362
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,600
so

363
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,440
really 100 degrees or more and where i

364
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,839
live it's 100 degrees just about every

365
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,480
day from june through

366
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,160
august and so maduras hoping that i can

367
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,560
get some good results off that the

368
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,319
melons started producing male flowers so

369
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,719
far waiting for the female flowers to

370
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,639
come about and the peppers haven't

371
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,839
started folding flowers yet so not quite

372
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,440
there yet but everything's healthy

373
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,760
everything's looking good so far growing

374
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,920
anything else just harvested four plants

375
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,679
of chilotoji so just finished up that

376
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,919
breeding run that you guys saw on my

377
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,319
regular gardening channel and so i did a

378
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,078
seed run and prepping for my next grill

379
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,910
so i'm gonna be doing autoflowers next

380
00:13:50,078 --> 00:14:01,178
