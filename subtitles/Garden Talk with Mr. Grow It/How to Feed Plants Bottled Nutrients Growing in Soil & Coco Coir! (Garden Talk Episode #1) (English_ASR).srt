1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,659
what's up everybody feel that don't know

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:05,548
me my name is Chris aka mr. go it and

3
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:07,769
you're watching my extra channel got a

4
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,359
discussion video for you this week let's

5
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:10,649
talk about feeding nutrients feed

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,928
nutrients is one of those things where

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,830
beginners really struggle and I think

8
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,900
one of the things that people

9
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,910
misunderstand is that it can be done

10
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,789
different ways you can feed nutrients to

11
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,960
your plant in different ways so in this

12
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,539
video I'm going to talk about the way I

13
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,539
feed nutrients and I also brought in Rob

14
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,368
from CLTV he's gonna come in and explain

15
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,510
the way he feeds nutrients so you can

16
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:32,039
see that there are a few different ways

17
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,289
well those are just two different ways

18
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:35,609
but there are several different ways to

19
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:36,960
feed your plant nutrients so we're going

20
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:38,759
to focus on bottled nutrients on this

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,170
video if you want to see a video where

22
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:42,149
we talk about drying nutrients and how

23
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,260
to feed those two plants let me know in

24
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,230
the comment section below

25
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:48,089
alright let's just get into it alright

26
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:49,949
so what's up Rob we got Rob here how you

27
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,079
doing pretty good man appreciate you add

28
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,850
me on cool cool let's talk about feeding

29
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,878
nutrients so there's so many different

30
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,530
ways to do it I grow in soil I grown

31
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,500
coco coir I know you've also grown in

32
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,960
soil and coco coir you've done DWC as

33
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,489
well you mentioned on this video we're

34
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,560
just going to focus on soil and coco

35
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,909
coir when we will start with soil and

36
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,890
then we'll talk about some of the

37
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,920
techniques you do like starting from the

38
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,109
beginning how you do your feeding now

39
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,930
chime in as we go along and kind of say

40
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,129
how how I do things

41
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:24,240
and then yeah we'll go from there

42
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:26,129
absolutely cool you know what what are

43
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,759
you you typically use for soil to use a

44
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:32,759
specific brand or for what so what I was

45
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,349
using soil I would use ninety percent of

46
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,569
time I was using this Potter's gold

47
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:38,908
which is a michigan-based blend but it's

48
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:40,438
pretty comparable not it not verbatim

49
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,118
but it's pretty comparable to a fox farm

50
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:44,250
ocean forest so it's kind of like a pre

51
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:45,750
amended medium what's nice with that you

52
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,609
know for me especially is I can water

53
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,469
earlier on when I first initially put my

54
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:50,909
seeds in or my clones and I don't have

55
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:52,739
to worry so much about feeding heavy at

56
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,570
that point now when using soil like

57
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:56,699
that's attractive for me because it's

58
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:57,868
kind of like once they I totally emitted

59
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,118
medium but it's gonna give you what you

60
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:01,649
need early on and it's been something

61
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:02,968
that when I know a lot of people who

62
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,129
will use like the Fox farm trio with

63
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:06,419
that it works pretty well but if you're

64
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:07,589
using something that is amended when

65
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,969
you're adding nutrients and I've seen

66
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,649
burning of the plants especially the

67
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:12,239
finicky strains like my headbanger is so

68
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,620
damn finicky it burns if you had

69
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,230
anything extra to it

70
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,810
got it yeah I use Fox emotion for soil

71
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:19,919
that's my main soil that I use and yeah

72
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,390
it's like you said it's amended with

73
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,799
nutrients it already has nutrients in it

74
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:25,378
so I don't need to feed any additional

75
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,019
nutrients on top of that for the first

76
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:29,549
20 to 40 days or so it also depends on

77
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:31,500
how often you transplant up right so I

78
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,030
usually start in a solo cup for my photo

79
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,280
period plants and I'll transplant up

80
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,900
into either a one gallon container or go

81
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,610
into my final final container which is

82
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,799
like a three gallon or a five gallon and

83
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,090
once I'm transplanting up it's got that

84
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:44,430
first soil in there right which is

85
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,250
amended with nutrients so I can hold off

86
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,290
on feeding any bottled nutrients because

87
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,780
you know that soil has nutrients in it

88
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:53,219
that's eating the way out so I usually

89
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,110
start feeding bottled nutrients around

90
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:57,150
day 30 here's what I usually say day 30

91
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,099
day 40 is that kind of about the same

92
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,810
for you yeah yeah the only thing that I

93
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:02,159
do in between then is sometimes I'll do

94
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,810
a little bit of molasses or something to

95
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,219
help feed the microbes in there and try

96
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,539
to add a little bit in there sometimes

97
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:08,159
I'll even amend a little bit with some

98
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:09,539
great white even add you know

99
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,370
mycorrhizae and there additionally

100
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:15,060
especially when I'm transplanting into

101
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:17,609
the mix how much molasses to you is an

102
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,129
average like usually a half a teaspoon

103
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:22,049
per gallon and do once a week okay and

104
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:24,449
that at that point I was just doing just

105
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,700
molasses and water got it okay I do

106
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:29,339
about one tablespoon per gallon of water

107
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,750
Frances I was doing a lot more initially

108
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,039
at again mid that had bigger in

109
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,709
particular this head Baker that I've

110
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:36,449
grown it's a biker Kush crossed with

111
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,799
Sour Diesel from karma genetics one of

112
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,988
my favorite strains by far if you watch

113
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,840
lifestyle TV talked about it a hundred

114
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:45,090
thousand times that strain is so damn

115
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,250
finicky man like it seems like I need to

116
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,900
give low dosages everything even with

117
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,180
molasses which I've never seen my plants

118
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,489
act weird with molasses but it seems

119
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,049
like as it's uh opening up having those

120
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:56,430
microbes being fed more and it's helping

121
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,409
the plant eat more it's like it's too

122
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,939
much for that that plant in particular

123
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:01,348
not with my wife I oh gee and now with

124
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,659
my eleven roses that I can go a little

125
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:04,738
bit harder you know three teaspoons or

126
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,049
tablespoons

127
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,609
that no issue but it's only with the

128
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:10,290
headbanger which is my main strain I

129
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:11,489
grow yeah that's a good call those

130
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:12,810
different genetics are gonna act

131
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:15,480
differently as far as like nutrient

132
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,889
uptake so I had mentioned you know 30

133
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,918
days before I start feeding well some

134
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:22,168
strains might might not need that soon I

135
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,919
could no longer so genetic swag is gonna

136
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:25,359
be a big variable there

137
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,490
on when to start feeding so that's a

138
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,129
great call out so what do you use for

139
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,360
nutrients based nutrients I'm really

140
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:32,740
digging humble secret that's what I've

141
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,090
been using for a while it's not as known

142
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,980
really in a mainstream side it seems

143
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:37,539
like they're more like direct sale but

144
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,000
I've been using their base nutrients for

145
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:43,689
a long time just recently I ran emerald

146
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,339
emerald harvest yeah emerald harvest but

147
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:46,779
along with golden tree as well so that's

148
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:50,469
like their all-in-one additive it's got

149
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:51,849
kelp amino acids bunch of other [ __ ] in

150
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,320
it actually they kind of as a little bit

151
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,370
of proprietary secret sauce that they

152
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,420
don't really share everything in it

153
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,879
that's the only thing I'm not a huge fan

154
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,170
of but it's been one of the things that

155
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,939
you can replace almost the entire

156
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,620
advance nutrients line with just the one

157
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:05,560
bottle you need your base nutrients and

158
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,240
that and you really are all set now the

159
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,740
only thing I had to additionally again

160
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,930
is to micros I'm using at the moment

161
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,340
recharge before I was using great white

162
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,650
I just used that for transplanting now

163
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:16,599
but with recharge it's got that molasses

164
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:18,279
already in it so when I'm feeding the

165
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,689
plants especially in veg I'm already

166
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:21,339
giving it that molasses and it's feeding

167
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:22,870
those microbes it's then that same mix

168
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:24,339
and I'm doing that usually every other

169
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,889
feeding they recommend every other

170
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:28,000
feeding or once a week and aggressively

171
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:30,789
seemingly is working really well with

172
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,370
these plants right now do you do go by

173
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,780
their feeding chart and if you do you

174
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:38,319
could do like a full dose after dose

175
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:39,849
quarter dose so yeah I usually go by the

176
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,230
feeding chart but I start when I first

177
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,720
start up for that 30 days especially if

178
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,250
I'm using soil I start 1/3 strength what

179
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,080
they recommend usually and then I

180
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,970
gradually increase over time as the

181
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:50,169
plant kind of shows the signs that it's

182
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,750
healthy and hungry and it's doing well

183
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,009
I'll slowly increase and if it gives me

184
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,079
any signs of burning I'll back off a

185
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:57,610
little bit to more half strength and for

186
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,529
me again the strains the finicky strains

187
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,930
I'm using that works the best some of

188
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:03,339
the more like I'd say tougher strains

189
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,379
that I've grown I can go full blast

190
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:07,179
right out the gate and they are totally

191
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:10,149
fine and those ones though they don't

192
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,769
seem as as Turkey and unique to me but

193
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:13,089
they produce really well so this pushes

194
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:15,849
and helps it yield really well but at

195
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:17,979
the same time with the additive of the

196
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,420
great white I feel like I would rather

197
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,610
put that energy into that Turkey

198
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,810
high-quality strain than the producing

199
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,610
strain because I'm just smoking all my

200
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,870
but I'm not the type who's there any

201
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,280
black market stuff anything like that so

202
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,629
it's more of a scenario where anything

203
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,909
that I have when I harvest I'm gonna

204
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:31,810
keep it I'm not gonna be worrying so

205
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,830
much about quantity

206
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,939
I've had a lot of times with the

207
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:35,769
nutrient lines where I've changed up

208
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:37,368
using green planet at one point and I

209
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:39,318
seemingly got a little bit more

210
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:40,819
like I was impressed but on the other

211
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,939
side I seemingly lost a little bit at

212
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:45,499
terpene profile so I think I can't

213
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:47,028
completely vouch your humble secret

214
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:48,588
being that it's gonna you know bloom

215
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:50,088
huge buds and all this stuff but the

216
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:51,499
quality difference using that even in

217
00:06:50,088 --> 00:06:54,050
comparison Amaral harvest has been a

218
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:56,149
huge difference hmm that's interesting

219
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,569
yeah I've been using so I started off

220
00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:01,278
using Fox farm the trio loved that only

221
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:02,689
that's super concentrated so I had to

222
00:07:01,278 --> 00:07:04,639
really start with like a third or a

223
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:06,319
quarter dose or a third dose yeah art

224
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,509
and then kind of worked my way up I

225
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,490
think there's actually been several runs

226
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:13,490
web haven't even had to feed the plants

227
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,929
a full dose out of Fox from tree oh now

228
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,098
I am currently using blue planet

229
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:18,948
nutrients which is completely different

230
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:21,528
and you know I usually start with a half

231
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:23,689
dose with them and then kind of in

232
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:25,538
flowering I have been doing a full dose

233
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:28,789
too you know again depending on genetics

234
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:31,338
but some some genetics DEET a full dose

235
00:07:28,788 --> 00:07:32,360
of blue planet nutrients so just knowing

236
00:07:31,338 --> 00:07:34,579
that there's a difference between

237
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,429
nutrient lineups as far as what the

238
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:41,528
dosage should be I think is a key thing

239
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:44,628
to take away there now do you need every

240
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:47,118
every time or every other time or what

241
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:48,619
when growing in soil now when I was

242
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:50,959
grown in soil I usually would feed every

243
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:52,399
time and seemingly plants were totally

244
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,718
cool there I wouldn't do any watering

245
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,459
the only time I would do straight waters

246
00:07:53,718 --> 00:07:58,069
later towards the flushing cycle of

247
00:07:55,459 --> 00:08:00,889
course but consistently I would feed you

248
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:02,629
know regular basis no problem usually

249
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:04,429
four times a week at the time I was

250
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:05,929
using um because now I'm growing a coco

251
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:07,758
but at the time I was using 7 to 10

252
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:09,739
gallon pots it's not only need to water

253
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,749
you know our feed like three to four

254
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,939
times a week if that depending on the

255
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:15,800
season hmm and the plants never showed

256
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:17,959
any stress I had one strain at the time

257
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,418
this is Holy Grail cush that that one

258
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:22,939
really could show some signs of toxicity

259
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:24,799
but every other plant was just beautiful

260
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:26,959
immaculate and I mean I've used

261
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,088
everything from dyna-gro house and

262
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:33,408
garden advanced nutrients again green

263
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:35,479
planet technical or ax and with harvests

264
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:36,438
like I mean we've tried a lot but that's

265
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,788
that's what helped me to build the

266
00:08:36,438 --> 00:08:40,098
chorus club and so I was like I'm gonna

267
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:41,120
be the guinea pig for this so I need to

268
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:42,560
know what the hell I'm talking about I

269
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,480
can't just be saying all that try this

270
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,888
try this try that until I try them all

271
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,329
and I really wanted to figure out what

272
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:49,278
recipe worked well for me in my

273
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:50,479
particular genetics because I have

274
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,528
buddies who've been using advanced

275
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,959
for years and their stuff looks

276
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:55,549
immaculate I bring it to my setup and it

277
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,739
the plants don't respond the same way

278
00:08:55,549 --> 00:09:00,229
they like they become kind of general

279
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,610
and generic you know as we're like the

280
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,199
variables that come into play you can't

281
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,759
just say this is the one nutrient to use

282
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:06,559
this is the one thing if you know what

283
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:08,588
your plant needs that's key but

284
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,239
following a complete line it seems like

285
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:13,519
the the quality and the results

286
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,860
definitely vary so I feed every other

287
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,750
time most most of the time it's every

288
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,360
other time but I do check the ppm of the

289
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:23,570
runoff to see kind of get a picture of

290
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,610
how much nutrients are in the medium so

291
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,560
sometimes that will feed every time if

292
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,269
the ppm is low or sometimes I'll feed

293
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:31,909
every other time or there's times where

294
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:34,459
I'm doing a water water feed water water

295
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:36,500
feed so it really depends I always check

296
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:38,719
the ppm of the runoff do you check the

297
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:42,320
runoff ppm at all do you have a ppm

298
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,300
tester or TDS testo or EC meter though I

299
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,550
do now at the time when I was growing

300
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:47,929
soil so I've changed the coco but at the

301
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:49,129
time when I was growing soil I didn't

302
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:50,509
and I was doing a lot of things kind of

303
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:51,828
novice rookie style where I'm just

304
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:54,019
throwing it in and open for good results

305
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:56,239
and a few times I did have nutrient lock

306
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:57,860
outs where I was getting either salt

307
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,360
pocket buildups which I feel like it's

308
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,190
less common with soil compared to cocoa

309
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,870
but it was more of me I feel like

310
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,279
putting too much in that medium and the

311
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,929
plants just not absorbing it fast enough

312
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:07,309
and I wasn't using the microbes like I

313
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:08,539
should at the time so there was just the

314
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:10,909
variables that came into play that

315
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:12,860
overfeeding toxicities became a huge

316
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:14,958
problem got it okay now we're checking

317
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,120
the ppm zai ideal now I do that now with

318
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,159
Coco is we're like you know I do more of

319
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,539
that water feed water feed where I break

320
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:22,338
it down and I see that those results

321
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:25,599
again different mediums different

322
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:27,910
treatments so to speak but

323
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,259
oil or some people use a peat mix

324
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:31,448
they'll call us oil I mean it's oil but

325
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:33,278
it's like pro mix like a peat moss you

326
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:35,439
know a lot of them I feel like are more

327
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,939
absorbent and can if they are more inert

328
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,529
and there's nothing in the medium really

329
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,360
then you can go a little bit harder but

330
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:42,429
using a fox farm like that's where it

331
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,990
was tough man I should have waited and I

332
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:45,578
should have slowed dosed it but I was

333
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,409
doing every feeding consistently and

334
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:49,838
that holy girl let me know or let me

335
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:53,019
know right away that it was just a no-go

336
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,720
now what about pH do you do adjust the

337
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:57,850
pH of the nutrient solution prior to

338
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,410
feeding the plants so usually what I'll

339
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,940
do is I'll put all my nutrients into the

340
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:03,759
water and then I'll check the P or the

341
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,110
pH afterwards and with everything other

342
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,550
than dyna-gro was the only thing that I

343
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,199
really didn't get it right down to where

344
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:08,919
I needed to be it was closer like 67

345
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:10,838
with dyna-gro

346
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:13,328
every other nutrient line I've used has

347
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,800
been pretty much pH perfect but it's for

348
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:17,229
soil like it's bringing it right down to

349
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:20,109
six point four six point five I've never

350
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:22,778
had it lower than that going higher

351
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,039
dosage with the the golden tree though I

352
00:11:22,778 --> 00:11:25,689
notice that does bring my pH down a

353
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:27,039
little bit lower you can use that kind

354
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,720
of similar to a vitamin D supplement

355
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,620
like you would with super thrive where

356
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,930
if you've got a really stressed out

357
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,339
plant you can hire dosa instead of a

358
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:35,169
teaspoon per gallon you can do a

359
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:37,089
tablespoon per gallon for like a one

360
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:38,588
time feeding and in that case it's the

361
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:40,240
only time the pH dropped way lower

362
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:42,610
otherwise I usually don't have to dial

363
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,180
in that pH much when I'm using soil for

364
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,110
me when I adjust the nutrient mix

365
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:49,059
normally I will like will do play

366
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,560
nutrients I'll have to adjust up I

367
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:52,659
forget about Fox for I think I'd adjust

368
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,419
up with Fox farm but I'll adjust the pH

369
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:58,929
up and like roughly around 6.5 is what I

370
00:11:55,419 --> 00:12:01,208
like to feed in at and then I'll also pH

371
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:03,159
the runoff as well see what the pH of

372
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,958
the runoff is because yeah that can be

373
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:07,208
different do you do you do that as well

374
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,309
or yeah with again with cocoa I do with

375
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:10,869
soil of this was uh it's fun probably

376
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:13,239
seven eight years since I've grown in

377
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,919
soil it's been a while but I definitely

378
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,600
have acquaintances in different grow

379
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:19,000
knees in the club who are using soil and

380
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,800
with that process you know I feel like a

381
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,720
lot of people overlook the fact that the

382
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,969
medium is more alive being that it's

383
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,379
soil it's gonna be what you how you

384
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,120
treat it early on is kind of how it

385
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,470
needs to continuously go and especially

386
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,688
when somebody's doing something like

387
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,649
adding a dry amendment into it and when

388
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:34,328
they're changing the game instead of

389
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:36,068
using the liquid mineral based nutrients

390
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:37,969
I never really went that route just

391
00:12:36,068 --> 00:12:39,828
because I kind of like the easy

392
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,528
do it get it go kind of kool-aid style

393
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:44,299
but at the same time like having your

394
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:46,250
medium kind of work for you that's where

395
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:48,500
again using a great way or recharge or

396
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,970
something to inoculate that root system

397
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,589
and really get those roots working for

398
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,269
you is gonna help whatever nutrients you

399
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:54,709
use to be absorb better and taken in

400
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:56,810
better so that way it's not just like

401
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:58,278
throwing in nutrients into your medium

402
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,239
and hoping it does better needs to be

403
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,610
able to absorb it

404
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,620
one other thing to mention for me is

405
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,120
when I mix up my nutrients what I'll do

406
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,948
is I'll mix up the nutrients adjust the

407
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,399
pH and then I'll put in microbe two

408
00:13:06,948 --> 00:13:13,669
after the fact because I guess the pH up

409
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,870
and down will kill off microbes it's not

410
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:17,870
gonna kill off all of them but will kill

411
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:20,709
off some of them so it is advised to add

412
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:22,850
in the microbes after pH adjusting I

413
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:24,438
didn't know that so I appreciate the

414
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,899
system and and honestly didn't know that

415
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:28,698
you know it makes sense with the acidity

416
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:30,019
trying to add that in and changing it up

417
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:31,399
it totally doesn't make sense I just

418
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:33,259
I've been really blessed to not have to

419
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:35,360
deal with the pH level too much I still

420
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:37,430
dial it in and check it but only when

421
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,889
I'm using like if I'm watering again

422
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:41,508
with now with the cocoa mix when I'm

423
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:43,308
watering with that I'll do a plain water

424
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:45,649
or water with kalmec and I'll need to

425
00:13:43,308 --> 00:13:48,828
dial in that pH so that's where that

426
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:51,490
changes a little bit got it okay now

427
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:54,828
okay so you've what watering the plants

428
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:57,379
you water all the way through what do

429
00:13:54,828 --> 00:13:59,508
you do with the runoff usually I'll just

430
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:01,100
let it sit there for about maybe an hour

431
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:02,629
and then I use a shot back and suck it

432
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,040
all up and empty that shot back out I

433
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:05,569
don't let it sit in there too long but

434
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:07,278
especially when I'm in flower like I

435
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:08,568
don't mind the humidity level just

436
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:10,009
getting up a pinch more because I'm

437
00:14:08,568 --> 00:14:11,360
usually struggling with the humidity in

438
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:13,220
there here in Michigan I'm having to

439
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,350
like kick the humidifier on all the time

440
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,990
like it's on 24/7 because it's

441
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,569
fluctuating from like 30% a 60% there's

442
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,860
I try to keep it around 40 50 percent so

443
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,938
sometimes leaving those saucers with a

444
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,800
little bit of water will help me get

445
00:14:22,938 --> 00:14:29,659
that you know room humidity right where

446
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:31,639
I needed to be got it for me I sometimes

447
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:34,129
they'll let it sit in there and just let

448
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:36,740
it absorb up other times I'll go ahead

449
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:38,930
and I'll shop back it up you know I've

450
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,698
noticed that I think there's you know it

451
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:43,308
equals more salt build-up if I don't

452
00:14:40,698 --> 00:14:46,099
suck up that if I don't suck up those

453
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:47,928
that runoff I feel like the salt

454
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,428
build-up and I have more problems maybe

455
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:51,278
it's just to my head but it just kind of

456
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:53,919
seems that way so

457
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:56,588
it makes sense in the habit of sucking

458
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:59,528
up that runoff more often and you know

459
00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:00,999
pushing things through and kind of you

460
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:03,188
know hopefully that that kind of clears

461
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:04,959
up any problems that I have but it might

462
00:15:03,188 --> 00:15:06,278
just be in my head it makes sense it's

463
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,899
not like it's an ebb and flow system you

464
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:08,980
know it's if it's just stagnant water

465
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:10,749
that's sitting there that ran

466
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,949
potentially pulled more assaults more

467
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:13,659
minerals out of your medium to the

468
00:15:11,948 --> 00:15:15,188
bottom and it's just sitting there and

469
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:16,208
it's stagnant I could see that being an

470
00:15:15,188 --> 00:15:17,528
issue and that's where I usually I don't

471
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,448
leave it too long and it's depending on

472
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:21,938
the season like at the most an hour and

473
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:23,498
it sometimes I have seen again with

474
00:15:21,938 --> 00:15:24,730
different mediums it does suck back up

475
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:26,620
pretty quickly I don't go through there

476
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,909
too fast when it's too dry and then it

477
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,740
just kind of absorbs back up like a

478
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:31,509
sponge I see it a little bit less with

479
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,579
their air of a soil in comparison to

480
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:36,009
using cocoa but it's something that I've

481
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:37,628
never seen a major issue leaving it that

482
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:38,949
long it's only I think it extended a

483
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:40,778
period of time and that's happened

484
00:15:38,948 --> 00:15:42,039
before when I think I'm good to go and I

485
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:43,539
leave to grow and I come back the next

486
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:45,399
morning and I'm like whoa look at all

487
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:47,198
this water still here I thought it was

488
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:48,938
good but it's slowly drained out yeah

489
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,498
yeah no I was trying to rush it in and

490
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:52,208
out of the grow I want to go back to

491
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:54,850
nutrients real quick one thing we didn't

492
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:56,469
talk about additives so you know based

493
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,329
nutrients Fox from trail basically has

494
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,459
three bottles for example I've found

495
00:15:58,328 --> 00:16:03,789
that ever since I switched to led I've

496
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:05,528
had calcium and magnesium issues and

497
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:07,599
I've had two supplemental kalmec so I

498
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:09,308
grew with hid for six years and then

499
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,709
I've been going to LED for about four

500
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:13,179
years four or five years now and so I

501
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,948
now I supplement mccallum AG do you

502
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:17,169
supplement with cal-mag or I need you

503
00:16:14,948 --> 00:16:19,958
put any other additives in there silica

504
00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:23,649
you know so on and so forth yeah I am

505
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:25,628
add right now I'm using a great white

506
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,100
and I'm using kalmyk those are my two

507
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:28,659
additives that I use and then I also

508
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,149
have the all-in-one additive which is

509
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:32,708
golden tree so like basically that

510
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:34,629
all-in-one additive is like all of your

511
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:36,039
additional micro or macro nutrients not

512
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:38,289
macro all of your additional micro

513
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:40,629
nutrients it's got um your amino acids

514
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:41,919
kelp carbs I'm into minerals in there

515
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:43,058
too so it's nice you can kind of work

516
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,799
that in conjunction with your base

517
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:46,299
nutrients and then with again if using

518
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,948
something like cocoa I'm adding cal-mag

519
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:49,568
on a regular basis I haven't had the

520
00:16:47,948 --> 00:16:50,078
pleasure to do soil I will be soon

521
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:52,838
actually

522
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,248
soil underneath the LED so I haven't ran

523
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:56,470
into that but I always am adding some

524
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:59,500
cal-mag in because of it being cocoa for

525
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,569
me do you feed cal-mag every time even

526
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,549
when even on your watering days or do

527
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:04,000
you only still feed cal-mag again on

528
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:06,519
your feet

529
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,279
days I do it more on my watering days

530
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:10,990
actually so like I'm doing the lower

531
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,568
dosage recommended so 2.5 milliliters

532
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:16,390
per gallon with what I'm feeding and

533
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:18,459
then when I'm doing just by itself plain

534
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,860
water I'll do cal-mag at a full strength

535
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:23,529
of like 5 milliliters per gallon I kind

536
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:27,698
of varies for me I'll gut and add it in

537
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:29,379
with my normal nutrients at 5 to 10

538
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:30,970
milliliters per gallon I think my Blue

539
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,490
Planet nutrients cal-mag goes up to 10

540
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:36,789
milliliters per gallon maybe you're some

541
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:39,250
more watered down I don't know but on my

542
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:40,599
watering days sometimes I will add in

543
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,609
just cal-mag but most of the time I

544
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:45,250
don't but that's a question I have for

545
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:46,869
the people that are watching this do you

546
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,880
feed cal-mag every time let me know in

547
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:51,789
the comment section below what you do

548
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,380
for cal-mag feeding okay next one thing

549
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:55,180
I want to touch on real quick didn't

550
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,070
really revolve with feeding nutrients

551
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,990
but it relates to it which is the

552
00:17:57,069 --> 00:18:01,629
flushing aspect you flush it all during

553
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:03,609
your grow like mid grow like to flush

554
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,950
out any salt or anything if I'm having

555
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:07,509
some issues I do I usually don't I at

556
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,769
one point I was doing that transitioning

557
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:11,079
into flower and then I've stopped doing

558
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:12,759
that and I've noticed no difference what

559
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:14,589
I've done though is I've just done lower

560
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,660
dosages of my flowering newest nutrients

561
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:18,699
switching into flower but I recently did

562
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,890
a little test basically and it worked

563
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,539
pretty well is I started feeding my

564
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,610
flowering nutrients a week before going

565
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:26,200
into flower so in veg I started feeding

566
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:28,149
the flowering nutrients and I've got

567
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,910
zero stretch like I measured that there

568
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:33,460
was no stretch not a centimeter none but

569
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,529
my headbanger was yellow as hell got

570
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,779
lime green and stressed out like really

571
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:39,549
not happy the 11 roses that I'm growing

572
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:41,859
totally fine totally great bushy and

573
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:43,720
nice one of my plants that was not happy

574
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:46,659
so it was an experiment that I saw was

575
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,190
good for one strain and it helps there

576
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,990
but I think maybe if I would have

577
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:51,759
flushed and then done that it made a

578
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,650
result a little bit better because that

579
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,329
strain is very finicky that headbanger

580
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,970
is just one that like you got to treat

581
00:18:55,329 --> 00:19:00,099
it really unique yeah for me I I try to

582
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,839
avoid flushing mid grow as much as

583
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:03,459
possible I've tried the flushing between

584
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,740
veg and flower before one time I worked

585
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,299
out great and then the other two times

586
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,880
the next two times unfortunately I had

587
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:11,799
like yellowing like doing this into

588
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,170
flowering and it's like all great so

589
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:16,269
worst time you have problems is you know

590
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,509
beginning flower mid flowering so I try

591
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:19,158
to avoid flushing

592
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:20,720
as much as possible but sometimes you

593
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,039
need to like I'm growing some plants

594
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,470
right now which I need to do admit flush

595
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:26,388
on which so unfortunately but sometimes

596
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,819
you got to do what you got to do yeah

597
00:19:26,388 --> 00:19:31,459
now flushing at the end of the cycle do

598
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:33,558
you flush before you harvest yeah so

599
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,389
what I usually do is I feed my plant for

600
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:36,769
about six to seven weeks depending on

601
00:19:35,388 --> 00:19:38,148
the strain I'm growing if it's a to nine

602
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:40,220
weaker usually the furthest I go is a

603
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:41,569
nine week strain once in a while if I

604
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,120
land a ten week or out I'll let her go

605
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:45,200
but usually two weeks prior to harvest I

606
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:46,638
just stopped feeding nutrients

607
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,630
completely and I'm just watering pretty

608
00:19:46,638 --> 00:19:49,939
heavy enough where there's a good amount

609
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,169
of runoff but not like a crazy amount

610
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,298
like a heavy flush you see a lot of

611
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:54,799
people doing so you know what I've read

612
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:55,970
and what I've understood over times of

613
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:57,740
growing and reading all the different

614
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,149
grow Bibles is that the plants gonna

615
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,798
still have about fourteen days left of

616
00:19:59,148 --> 00:20:02,959
nutrients in the medium so it's gonna

617
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:05,089
have time to eat that up and I'd rather

618
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,528
instead of it having like an extra two

619
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:07,819
weeks of time to eat it up after the

620
00:20:06,528 --> 00:20:09,288
fact I'd rather give it that full two

621
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:10,970
weeks to just eat it but it has kind of

622
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:12,138
fade out get the color that I like

623
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,179
especially I love that kind of like

624
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:15,859
purplish yellow faded look to the leaves

625
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:18,259
when it's finishing and that's where

626
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:20,058
like I don't see that unless I flushed

627
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:21,019
to each prior and again my flush is a

628
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:22,788
little different than most people I just

629
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,500
start feeding plain water all the way

630
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:27,200
through pH balanced water of course but

631
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,230
and that's it for two weeks and usually

632
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,538
my plants fade out like I want and

633
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,940
boyash good to go for me usually about

634
00:20:32,538 --> 00:20:37,069
two weeks out when the trichomes are

635
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,870
about right I will

636
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,980
depending on the the color of the plants

637
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:41,599
right if it's like dark green leaves

638
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:44,470
I'll guide not do a full flush where I'd

639
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:47,028
basically flush out double the amount of

640
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:49,519
water and gallons so if I'm doing like a

641
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:50,929
three gallon grow pod I'll put six

642
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:54,109
gallons of water through the medium and

643
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:56,090
that'll help get some of those nutrients

644
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:58,819
out of there and help those leaf lighten

645
00:20:56,089 --> 00:21:00,678
up get those chlorophyll breakdown so on

646
00:20:58,819 --> 00:21:02,000
and so forth and then other times there

647
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:04,548
will already be starting being a little

648
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,380
natural fade a couple weeks prior so now

649
00:21:04,548 --> 00:21:08,028
I'll just feed playing water for the

650
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,409
remainder of the grow and then it'll you

651
00:21:08,028 --> 00:21:10,220
know continue to fade and then I'll be

652
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:12,559
ready to harvest

653
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,058
okay so genetics specific I think it's

654
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:15,500
so like there's never just a rule of

655
00:21:14,058 --> 00:21:17,509
thumb there's like five different rules

656
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,798
because when it comes to certain strains

657
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,960
like you know I've had this dosey doe

658
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,369
that was looking like it was done in

659
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,899
seven weeks and I was feeding full

660
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:25,699
spring nutrients it's like what's going

661
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:27,829
on like it's just telling me hey I'm

662
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,919
about done so then I just slowly started

663
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:31,159
flushing and did great I had a wife iog

664
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:33,800
that

665
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,779
like vibrant bright green and I'm like

666
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:38,359
what's going on so that's why I did a

667
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:39,410
heavy flush and that is exactly the

668
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:40,969
result you know I was then get more

669
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:42,529
yellowing more the chlorophyll breakdown

670
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,730
you start to see that plant decaying and

671
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:45,769
dying like it should like you would see

672
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:47,630
outside normally mmm than the neckline

673
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:50,240
but I mean all right let's move on to

674
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,830
Coco core that's my specialty now that's

675
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,539
what I'm into Minh sweet

676
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:56,059
alright so pretty much the same same

677
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:59,329
flow that we had before so you know what

678
00:21:56,059 --> 00:22:01,039
type of Coco do you use so I'm a big fan

679
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:02,929
of world gold and I really love that

680
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,480
their whole line right now I'm using two

681
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:07,549
per it's just cocoa pearlite and some

682
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,680
aged forest minerals and it's pretty

683
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:11,899
much nothing in it you know it's pretty

684
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,360
much an inert medium the main thing for

685
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,820
me is I was getting you know big bricks

686
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:18,949
of the pro mix for a while and I started

687
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:20,450
bringing home rude aphids and that was a

688
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,920
real headache for mixing like what am i

689
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,960
doing that it's creating these aphids

690
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,580
man and then I had another buddy at the

691
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,140
gross stores Aki dude I got who Davis

692
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:28,220
and another buddy that and I'm like I

693
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,020
haven't been to your girl you've been to

694
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,130
my grow we're all using the same medium

695
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:32,359
we kind of all just came together more

696
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,280
like yeah man they're not storing this

697
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:36,349
properly like somes going on here I

698
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:38,029
don't know what like not working so I

699
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:39,619
ended up trying Coco I'm like you know

700
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:40,730
what I'm gonna see how it works and for

701
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:42,229
the longest time I was getting just

702
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,460
cheap bricks from Amazon and I wasn't

703
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,860
liking what I was getting like just

704
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,420
wasn't wasn't the results that I heard

705
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:50,419
people getting until we linked up with

706
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,550
world gold and they we went to buy the

707
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:55,789
cup some years back and it was really

708
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:57,200
insightful on how how cocoa is sourced

709
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:59,149
and how you get it in general and like

710
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,769
even the sustainability compared to peat

711
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,180
moss and that's really what helped me as

712
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:03,589
I'm trying to even transition from

713
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,180
mineral based nutrients to organic

714
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:07,399
nutrients for the sustainability

715
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,750
purposes you know and that was a really

716
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,300
attractive thing and then for the

717
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,529
watering to like you know I sometimes do

718
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:13,669
you need a water more often because I'm

719
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:14,930
let's say I'm gonna be leaving the next

720
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:16,400
day so I'm gonna do a heavy water in the

721
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,509
morning and on light water at night and

722
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,759
then I don't have to worry about it for

723
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:21,049
a day or two at all and just little

724
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:22,940
variables for me that I was really

725
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:24,349
attracted to and I really like TWC at

726
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,059
one point and I like the results I got

727
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:28,219
but some of the things from Coco that

728
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:31,099
are not from soil that I preferred kind

729
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:33,200
of were mixed in hybridized with using

730
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:34,639
the soilless media so that's why I

731
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,509
switched over and then to pur has been

732
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,160
great for me man

733
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:38,450
other than I can't ever get it and I get

734
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,050
the gross tour it's always out making

735
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,170
people buy the out of it around here

736
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:46,230
got it yeah I've been using those cheap

737
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:49,110
bricks from Amazon and I'm gonna rinse

738
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:50,910
them out and buffer them and still I

739
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:52,259
mean I've had issues with them

740
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,850
yeah really only growing a Coco a

741
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:56,390
handful of times so I don't have too

742
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:58,799
much experience with Coco I prefer soil

743
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:01,230
but I do have experience growing a coco

744
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:04,649
and yeah those those bricks are filled

745
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:06,720
with sodium mostly and yeah it's just

746
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:08,310
enough they've been like scraped up off

747
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,130
of beaches and stuff and like just

748
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:13,319
source very poorly you know yeah yeah

749
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,600
but wait so when you start feeding

750
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:18,210
nutrients in Coco so I usually start

751
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,919
after like a week I'll let the plant

752
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:22,019
especially if I'm doing a clone like I

753
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,430
usually use aeroponic loaners so my

754
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:24,750
roots are just straight up roots going

755
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,730
right into the media and I don't want to

756
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,859
like shock them directly right away so

757
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,539
I'll just feed the first week but on

758
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:32,369
feed I'll just water plain pH balanced

759
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:33,869
water and then after that is when I'll

760
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:35,189
start feeding and I start with third

761
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:36,809
strength nutrients and work my way up

762
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,940
week by week where I'm denim to full

763
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,019
strength if the plant needs it if it

764
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,430
doesn't that I'm not going to go full

765
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:44,369
strength because I do see some strains

766
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:46,440
there vibrant green and good at like 3/4

767
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:47,849
strength all right keep it at that like

768
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,680
there's no reason to I guess I could add

769
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:51,089
more potentially but I've seen too many

770
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,350
times where I'm burning the leaves and

771
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,909
I'd rather just avoid that if I don't

772
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:55,829
see the plant telling me that it wants

773
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,269
more I'm not going to add more and you

774
00:24:55,829 --> 00:25:00,119
use the same type of nutrients that you

775
00:24:57,269 --> 00:25:01,619
use for soil yep again the difference

776
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:03,479
here is using cal-mag more frequently

777
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:05,549
because you know it's gonna meet it

778
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:09,390
totally a nurse so I've been using that

779
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:11,190
consistently now for like 7 years it's

780
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,720
been a while now I remember I always say

781
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,690
like been grown for 10 plus years but

782
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,329
longer than that at this point 2020 so I

783
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,009
think that the difference for me I don't

784
00:25:18,329 --> 00:25:21,750
notice a massive yield difference I see

785
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:24,269
people who argue about the quality

786
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:26,789
difference or the turf difference but I

787
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:28,319
think the control of being able to fix

788
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:30,210
the sick sick plant where I can maybe

789
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,579
add more nutrients quicker or I can feed

790
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:34,289
it more consistently and the fact that

791
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:35,879
again I'm not worried so much about over

792
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:37,500
watering that plant like I can go real

793
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,470
hard with it I'm not stressing it out

794
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,880
too much for me it takes about a week I

795
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:43,140
do about the same thing where it's about

796
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,880
a week that the plant has been growing

797
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,610
and then I'll start feeding nutrients I

798
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,030
will I'll feed kalmyk every time no

799
00:25:47,609 --> 00:25:50,099
matter what

800
00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:52,668
even on my watering days and yeah

801
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:54,528
nutrients is usually every other

802
00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:56,509
depends I still do check the peepee I'm

803
00:25:54,528 --> 00:25:58,788
gonna run off as well and kind of keep

804
00:25:56,509 --> 00:25:59,509
in that range similar to I do how I do

805
00:25:58,788 --> 00:26:02,239
in soil

806
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:04,730
now what about pH pH is a pretty pretty

807
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:07,038
significant topic when it comes to Coco

808
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,538
core what do you do for pH to pH your

809
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:11,269
nutrient solution prior to putting it in

810
00:26:08,538 --> 00:26:12,950
yes all ah pH my nutrient solution you

811
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:14,179
know after I add all my mix to it now

812
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,700
I'll be adding in microbes after the

813
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:19,159
fact appreciate that zip there should

814
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,980
have been on that already but um so then

815
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:23,600
I'll do my pH after the fact and I 99.9%

816
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,759
of the time need to do it because the

817
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,278
lowest that it goes with my mix is 26.4

818
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:29,899
and so when I'm in veg I'll do anywhere

819
00:26:28,278 --> 00:26:32,419
from five point five to five point eight

820
00:26:29,898 --> 00:26:33,949
and the high end six usually I try to

821
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:35,690
keep it within that five point five to

822
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,220
five point eight range and then once I'm

823
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,840
like midway through flour I'll change

824
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,308
that up closer to six point two from

825
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:42,168
from what I've read it can help the

826
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:44,118
phosphorus and potassium uptake a little

827
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:47,570
bit more and that's gonna be you know

828
00:26:44,118 --> 00:26:49,278
again with cocoa it reacts a little bit

829
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:50,960
differently but I see I see that kind of

830
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:52,339
swelling it up or doing what I can to

831
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,139
try to help those blood so a lot more

832
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:56,778
well still getting the benefits of

833
00:26:54,138 --> 00:26:58,308
feeding heavy and not overdoing it is by

834
00:26:56,778 --> 00:26:59,628
changing that pH it's the only

835
00:26:58,308 --> 00:27:02,450
difference I've noticed from my growers

836
00:26:59,628 --> 00:27:05,238
upping it to around six point to do pH

837
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:07,700
the runoff as well or only the nutrient

838
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:09,350
solution going in I'll test the pH of

839
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,639
the runoff so I don't always do it like

840
00:27:09,349 --> 00:27:11,868
it I'll do it usually once a week and

841
00:27:10,638 --> 00:27:13,398
I'll check the ppm as well because

842
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:16,308
that's been like I've like straight up

843
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:18,378
PTSD over having new lockouts and just

844
00:27:16,308 --> 00:27:20,089
salt build-up still pockets in there and

845
00:27:18,378 --> 00:27:21,138
it's been one of those things where I've

846
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:22,699
thought it was a million different

847
00:27:21,138 --> 00:27:25,219
issues and it turns out that was the one

848
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,778
problem and it's see then I look back my

849
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:29,389
Oh common sense I was feeding way too

850
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:30,858
heavy or you know in one spot I was just

851
00:27:29,388 --> 00:27:32,719
pouring it all into a single spot and

852
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:34,579
let it flow through instead of evenly

853
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,899
dispersing the nutrients and there's

854
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:37,548
just a lot of different variables when

855
00:27:35,898 --> 00:27:39,229
it comes I feel like - cocoa of it being

856
00:27:37,548 --> 00:27:41,269
more totally controlled by you in

857
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:43,700
comparison to the soil kind of working

858
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:45,378
with it mm-hmm you got to kind of really

859
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,569
dial in your pH you got to make sure

860
00:27:45,378 --> 00:27:48,798
that you know some people grow straight

861
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:50,148
cocoa I've done that before and I feel

862
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:52,249
like it's suffocating my roots other

863
00:27:50,148 --> 00:27:53,479
people swear by it I always make sure I

864
00:27:52,249 --> 00:27:55,009
have some perlite in there I feel like

865
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,319
just the aeration to make sure that this

866
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:59,210
mayor to the roots but then in my cocoa

867
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:01,249
I always again I'll add that micro I say

868
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,598
whether I'm using great way I usually

869
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:04,249
use great way for transplanting that's

870
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,548
my go-to and then I'll water with

871
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:10,230
recharge

872
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:11,759
my ph 5.8 every time and then that's

873
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,548
kind of what I've had best results in is

874
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:17,159
just pH pH nutrient solution 5.8 every

875
00:28:14,548 --> 00:28:19,200
time going in I've tried to go up to six

876
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,080
point oh six point two I've gone up to

877
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,899
before but I've had issues deficiency

878
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,989
issues and so five point has just been

879
00:28:24,898 --> 00:28:30,118
kind of a magic thing for me now

880
00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:31,558
measuring the pH of the runoff you know

881
00:28:30,118 --> 00:28:34,109
at first when I first started using it

882
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:35,940
it kind of equals to what I put in you

883
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:37,798
know five-point age going going in five

884
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:40,379
point eight going out however over time

885
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:43,618
I found that it kind of significantly

886
00:28:40,378 --> 00:28:45,028
drifts upwards usually so like I'll put

887
00:28:43,618 --> 00:28:47,699
five point eight in and the offices now

888
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:49,048
see like high sixes or even sevens and

889
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,058
I'm like what that is going on here and

890
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:52,950
so I've done the research and a lot of

891
00:28:51,058 --> 00:28:55,769
people kind of agree that like with

892
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:57,389
cocoa it'll drift up so some people know

893
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:59,399
a lot of people I guess just ignore the

894
00:28:57,388 --> 00:29:01,558
runoff pH and that's what I tell people

895
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:04,648
grown in cocoa is to just ignore that

896
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:07,710
runoff pH and just only worry about the

897
00:29:04,648 --> 00:29:09,808
pH going in and that's that's just me

898
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:11,429
that's what I've had best luck yet so

899
00:29:09,808 --> 00:29:15,118
actually I would love to hear to the

900
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:17,519
viewers watching this do you pH adjust

901
00:29:15,118 --> 00:29:20,608
your nutrients going in to cocoa and

902
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,858
also do you check the runoff pH when

903
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:24,628
growing in cocoa I'd love to know your

904
00:29:22,858 --> 00:29:27,358
thoughts in the comment section below

905
00:29:24,628 --> 00:29:30,089
flushing any difference with flushing

906
00:29:27,358 --> 00:29:31,618
for cocoa compared to soil anything

907
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:33,358
really it's the same for me it'd

908
00:29:31,618 --> 00:29:34,888
definitely be the same thing I've seen

909
00:29:33,358 --> 00:29:37,288
people using you know additives like a

910
00:29:34,888 --> 00:29:39,118
to try to remove the minerals I think

911
00:29:37,288 --> 00:29:41,009
there's like design or something by

912
00:29:39,118 --> 00:29:42,658
tying to grow will use certain things

913
00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:44,819
like that I'm not into that I just do

914
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:46,320
straight stay pH balanced water okay

915
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:46,710
yeah pretty much same with me I know I

916
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,339
don't

917
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:53,429
rarely flush only really flush when I

918
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:55,709
have problems and then I'll do that end

919
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:58,379
of the grill flush same decision-making

920
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,669
as when I'm growing in soil and then and

921
00:29:58,378 --> 00:30:02,038
then runoff what do you do with the

922
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:03,509
runoff for cocoa so that to all same

923
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:05,460
exact scenario usually I'll suck that

924
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:09,028
off after about sucked it off just like

925
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,889
that out after an hour and it's like you

926
00:30:09,028 --> 00:30:12,329
know I've seen again people let their

927
00:30:10,888 --> 00:30:15,028
sit longer I've seen the drain to waste

928
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:16,888
growers who have like tubs of water damn

929
00:30:15,028 --> 00:30:18,358
near that it's sitting into but I just

930
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:19,289
don't like that stagnant water that's

931
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,879
built up with minerals

932
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:23,670
I'm too paranoid about having an issue

933
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,350
again PTSD from having the lockouts man

934
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,970
like I've had times where I thought it

935
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:28,439
was this that is that and it's the one

936
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:30,450
issue in me just overdoing it or not

937
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,460
paying attention that I'm the PPM is way

938
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:34,350
too high and they like they run off so

939
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,910
that that's more what I check more times

940
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:38,490
than the pH even for the run off is that

941
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,930
ppm to see him like is am I having way

942
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,390
more coming out than what I'm putting in

943
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:43,620
because that's a problem like the I've

944
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,360
done way too much in the medium and I

945
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:46,949
noticed that a lot less with cocoa then

946
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:48,869
when I dealt with soil it's rare that I

947
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:50,789
have an issue like that with cocoa and

948
00:30:48,869 --> 00:30:53,009
those little user-friendly things that

949
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:54,509
if you've controlling it is is you know

950
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:56,670
ideal but if you're not controlling it

951
00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:57,990
cocoa can be a major headache for those

952
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:00,480
little factors where you got a dial in

953
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,650
that pH even some nutrient lines the

954
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,200
keynotes with advanced they have the

955
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:05,910
cocoa version or like Coco's with house

956
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,799
and garden even to a lot of that I think

957
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:10,050
is pH related but also based on that

958
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,639
you're gonna need more calcium a lot of

959
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:13,019
times in your mix so what they're gonna

960
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,400
have formulated is gonna be a little

961
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:16,529
different so sometimes getting that

962
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,690
cocoa specific nutrient could be easier

963
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:20,430
to use than trying to you know mess with

964
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:24,269
the pH or modify things to work for

965
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:26,400
cocoa cool I think we covered just about

966
00:31:24,269 --> 00:31:28,440
everything anything that you can think

967
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,720
of as far as like feeding tips or

968
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,519
anything that you think we missed um I

969
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,710
think I mean have you done any dry

970
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:36,000
amendments for either yeah I don't think

971
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:38,279
dry amendments is a whole different

972
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,019
video yeah because I would coming said

973
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:41,970
yeah this is more just like bottled

974
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:44,579
nutrient feeding either yeah pretty much

975
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:46,799
maybe next time around we can we can do

976
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:49,230
a video yeah yeah I think the only thing

977
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,759
to add would be you know again big fan

978
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:52,019
of great white or recharge something

979
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:53,279
like that to make sure that your plants

980
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:55,049
absorbing those nutrients properly

981
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,000
there's other options my coast and a

982
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:58,889
Zoe's and things like that I guess it's

983
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,420
really totally up to the viewer but when

984
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:01,650
it comes to making sure what you're

985
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,060
putting into that plant is being

986
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:05,190
absorbed properly you definitely want

987
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:07,589
that root system to be working that's

988
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:09,809
that's key cool well Rob thank you so

989
00:32:07,589 --> 00:32:11,129
much for coming on to my channel and

990
00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:12,539
talking about feeding nutrients

991
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,650
definitely things a lot of good

992
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:15,000
information especially for the new

993
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,920
growers have a lot of new growth setting

994
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,049
me up with a lot of questions asking

995
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,390
about feeding nutrients and I think one

996
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:22,529
of the things that people confused on

997
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:24,900
they think it needs to be done the same

998
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:27,299
way every time there's only one way to

999
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,059
do it I think but I mean there's so many

1000
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:31,638
different ways to do it so

1001
00:32:29,058 --> 00:32:34,220
you know experiment try what you know

1002
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:35,928
experiment we do things and see what's

1003
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:38,839
