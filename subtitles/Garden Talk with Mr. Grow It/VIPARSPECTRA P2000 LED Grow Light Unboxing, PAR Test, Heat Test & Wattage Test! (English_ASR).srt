1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,869
what's up everybody feel that don't know

2
00:00:01,318 --> 00:00:05,609
me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,439
you watch am extras channel but

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:09,359
respecter sent me over there P two

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,370
thousand LED grow light and in this

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,750
video I am going to unbox the unit and

7
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:14,489
I'm also going to test the power output

8
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,350
I'm not gonna go over all the grow

9
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,850
lights features in this video but I will

10
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,470
link it down in the description section

11
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,400
below so you can learn more about it

12
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:23,059
okay

13
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,559
first thing out the box is the fixture

14
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:27,479
after that there's this card which tells

15
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,178
you what to do if you're happy or if

16
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,399
you're not happy here is the instruction

17
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:35,030
manual this includes information such as

18
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:40,590
safety information information about the

19
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:42,450
p1000 the P 1500 and the P 2000 and it

20
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,430
also includes some usage suggestions

21
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,760
we're going to use these suggestions for

22
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:51,929
our part tests it comes with two rope

23
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:56,459
ratchet hangers one wire hanging kit and

24
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:57,689
the last thing here is a power cord for

25
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,899
the part test I'm going to use the

26
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:03,448
Apogee mq6 20 extended rage part meter

27
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,939
this meter measures from 340 nanometers

28
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:08,640
to 1040 nanometers and the measurements

29
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:09,868
are in ppfd I do these part tests just

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,430
to give you a general idea of what the

31
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:12,900
power output is it's not gonna be

32
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,280
hundred percent accurate I take

33
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,380
measurements and grow tents which have

34
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,659
reflective walls that could increase the

35
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:20,579
numbers so just keep that in mind this

36
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,560
light does have a dimmer on it for the

37
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:24,539
test here I'll set it to a hundred

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,500
percent for all the measurements I take

39
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,479
the measurements according to the

40
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,489
manufacturers recommendation in this

41
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,978
case that's four feet by three and a

42
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:34,019
half feet for the vegetation stage at 24

43
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:36,239
inches away and three feet by three feet

44
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:39,000
flowering coverage area at 20 inches

45
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,280
away I plug the p2000 LED grow light

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,799
into my kilowatt meter and it shows one

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,290
point seven two amps pulling two hundred

48
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,740
four watts at the wall alright let's get

49
00:01:46,290 --> 00:02:23,659
into the measurements

50
00:01:47,739 --> 00:02:23,659

what do you think of these measurements

55
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:15,409
let me know down in the comment section

56
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,879

00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:18,738
girl light down in the description

58

section below so you can learn more I

59
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:23,149
also did a part test on the p1000 LED

60
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,680
grow light I'll link that video in the

61
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:27,079
outro card and I'll leave it at that

62
