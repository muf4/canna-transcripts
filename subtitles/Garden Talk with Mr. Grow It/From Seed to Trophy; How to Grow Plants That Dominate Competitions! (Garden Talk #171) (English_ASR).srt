61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080
I'm joined with Milo. Hi Dave. How you

62
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,000
doing today? Good. How you doing? Doing

63
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,280
good, man. Thanks for joining me today.

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,840
So, you have actually entered in and won

65
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,680
grow competitions in the past. And

66
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,680
that's one thing I really want to dive

67
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,840
into today. I want to learn how you go

68
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,000
about it. And I'm not just talking about

69
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,920
what competitions are out there and how

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,479
to enter them, but your specific

71
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,159
strategies that have helped you win. I

72
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,079
have to charge everybody a billion

73
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,519
dollars then if they want to know

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,000
exactly cuz then I'm going to tell you

75
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,599
the winning formula.

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,878
No, I'm just kidding. Of course. Of

77
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,039
course. Yeah, I don't have a problem

78
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,799
with that. Awesome, man. Sounds good.

79
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,479
But before we get too deep into things,

80
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,920
can we do an introduction? Maybe tell us

81
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,878
a little bit about yourself and how you

82
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:55,759
got into gardening. Sure. Um, I've been

83
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:59,518
growing on and off for 25 years, I would

84
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:01,598
say. On uh professionally, uh, you know,

85
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,080
in the legal market for the last five

86
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:08,318
years. All right. And then what made you

87
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,319
get into entering competitions? Um, I,

88
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,598
you know, I I always had people tell me

89
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,679
that I that I grew really good

90
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:19,079
flower.

91
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:23,480
So, I wanted to see if it was just, you

92
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:26,560
know, people blowing smoke or if if I if

93
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:28,840
I my flower was good enough to compete.

94
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,479
I I just felt like that was the next

95
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,479
logical evolutionary step was to go get

96
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,158
into competitions because if everybody's

97
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,719
telling my flower's so good, my flower

98
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:41,039
is so good. Um let's see if it's good

99
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,719
enough to beat other people who hear the

100
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,560
same thing as me. You know, that was

101
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,519
kind of just my motivation there. And I

102
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,120
felt like if uh and you know, I also

103
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,959
thought, you know, I don't want to just

104
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,120
compete locally because I think that's

105
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,439
what everybody does. I wanted to go

106
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,319
other everywhere I could possibly do it

107
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,079
and compete to really showcase that

108
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,318
yeah, what I have is special because I

109
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,400
felt like it was. And what competitions

110
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:07,839
have you entered and what awards have

111
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,760
you won? Um, I've won the Colorado

112
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,920
Connoisseur Cup. I I guess that was the

113
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:15,120
first competition that I really entered

114
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:18,478
seriously. um you know as a solo grower

115
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,879
and wanted to test my skill and and my

116
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:24,399
uh um selection process you know uh I

117
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,399
wanted to prove that my selection

118
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,399
process was superior to a lot of these

119
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,560
other guys in the competition circuit.

120
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,758
So, the Colorado Connoisseur Cup is a

121
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,040
8-monthlong blind judging competition

122
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,439
um here in Colorado, and I um I entered

123
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,479
that first with my Dante's Inferno

124
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,959
number six feno that I hunted um some

125
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:49,879
years ago, and it was really special,

126
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:52,959
and it it it took first place. Um, from

127
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:54,120
there, I believe the next competition I

128
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,359
won was

129
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,519
the I want to say the Cultivate Supply

130
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,680
Showdown

131
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,279
um, here in Colorado again as well, put

132
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,879
on by Cultivate Supply Store. Um, that's

133
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,719
another blind judging competition. Um,

134
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,319
and I was able to come out first place

135
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,320
on that one as well, which was really

136
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,439
cool. And the the very next competition

137
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,879
I believe I won was in Las Vegas. It was

138
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,639
the Candy Connect Community Candy Battle

139
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:24,240
Royale and I won that again. All of

140
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,759
those competitions I won with the same

141
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,360
Feno, Dante's Inferno number six. Um,

142
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,360
except for the second win on the

143
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,400
Colorado Connoisseur Cup I won with one

144
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,680
of my newest fenos, the 5280, as well as

145
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:40,000
my second wind win on the Connect uh,

146
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,240
Battle Royale. They had a The first

147
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,399
round of the Connect Battle Royale was a

148
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,319
candy battle royale. The second round

149
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:51,120
was candy and gas. So, last year I won

150
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,839
with Dante's Infernos number six, I won

151
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,240
uh best overall, best candy. This year I

152
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,599
won best gas with the 5280. So, which is

153
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,360
what I was going for. I was like, last

154
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,680
year I won candy, it'd be cool to go in

155
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,160
there and win gas this year, which I was

156
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,478
able to pull off. Man, that's so cool.

157
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,560
So, million-dollar question here is, is

158
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,038
Dante's Inferno number six available

159
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,038
anywhere? Seed form, clone, anything?

160
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,199
Yeah, I've I've released some I've made

161
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,120
some S1s and I also have the clone

162
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,000
available, but the only thing with that

163
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,079
cut is now it's extremely volatile and

164
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,600
it has a tendency tom under like the

165
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,318
slightest stressor. So, you have to

166
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,039
really be in tune with the plant and

167
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,600
understand how to how to feed it um and

168
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,680
how it grows to really be successful

169
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,120
with it because if not, it can get wild

170
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,639
on you and it'll pollinate a whole room

171
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,280
and then you're kind of like ah you're

172
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,199
you know, you're not liking it. So, um,

173
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,359
it's not something that I ever really

174
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,038
recommend for people. I have had people

175
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,038
buy it from me before because they've

176
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,439
been willing to take on the risk. Some

177
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,439
have been successful, some have not.

178
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,759
That's really interesting. I hear from

179
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:56,079
other breeders from time to time where

180
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,360
it's like we've have this picture

181
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:01,519
painted in our head that any type of

182
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,800
genetics that herm out is a sign of

183
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,639
weakness, yet you're over here winning

184
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,439
competitions with it. Right. So,

185
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,840
Exactly. That just proves that um you

186
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,680
know that's my my thinking precisely is

187
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,918
always outside the box just because

188
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,680
something you know don't get me wrong if

189
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,240
it hurt to the point to where like it

190
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,000
was detrimental every time but if it was

191
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,478
if it's manageable in the flower is

192
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,519
worth it which it really is. I mean it

193
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:29,360
the level of uniqueness um again we'll

194
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,598
go back to competitions after the candy

195
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,000
battle royale I won spanabis in Spain

196
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:38,918
with the same pheno. So to go from local

197
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,918
competitions to statewide competitions

198
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:44,399
to worldwide competitions with the same

199
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,240
cut and win over and over and over all

200
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,159
blind competitions. I have nothing I you

201
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,840
know Spain I I've never been to Spain in

202
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,439
my life. I don't know anybody in Spain.

203
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,000
You know to go there and win was just

204
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,680
like wow. Like I know what when I have

205
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,839
something special and I knew this feno

206
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,598
was exceptionally special. In all my

207
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,439
years of being a connoisseur going back

208
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,598
to high school, I've never seen anything

209
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,199
like it, smelled anything like it. So,

210
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,519
and it's really the flavor profile that

211
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,759
gets you. Um, you know, there's

212
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,680
good-looking we good-looking flower

213
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,080
everywhere, but the flavor profile is

214
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,639
what really stands out. And it's like a

215
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:20,758
it's like a cherry

216
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:24,160
uh rotten fruit, cherry sugar candy

217
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:26,560
concentrate times like a hundred. it it

218
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,120
the smallest amount in the room will

219
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,240
permeate the entire you know space that

220
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,158
it's in. I I can have some at home. I

221
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,320
have about uh you know around 3,000

222
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,240
square ft at home and I can have like a

223
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,560
fairly small amount on my countertop and

224
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,278
it'll literally fill fill from basement

225
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,919
to the top floor all with the scent and

226
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,919
it's like it's almost like like like

227
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,000
some type of air fresh. It's amazing how

228
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,399
it just spreads. Like I've never had any

229
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,799
feno in my life that's done that. So,

230
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,679
you know, that's I think is one of the

231
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,599
reasons why it's won so many

232
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:01,519
competitions. Um, and the, you know,

233
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,959
it's not just, you know, a lot of people

234
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,399
ask me, how do you do it? How do you do

235
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,958
it? How do you do it? I don't think

236
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,159
it's, you know, knowing how to grow well

237
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:12,399
is important. Um, but really having that

238
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,838
flavor palette to know when something is

239
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,120
different or to know when something is

240
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,760
special, I think is what really can make

241
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,039
you stand out from the rest. That makes

242
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,639
total sense. Now, how about your grow

243
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,240
style, right? How are you growing these

244
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,120
plants? Are you indoors, outdoors? Are

245
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,839
you in soil, cocoa, hydro, organic?

246
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,080
Indoor cocoa. I run the Athena Pro line.

247
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,680
Um, as you can see, I I I've been

248
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,800
running Athena for years. I've never

249
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,399
been successful with any other nutrient

250
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:41,759
line in my life. And I'm not going to

251
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,600
say that there isn't something out there

252
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,240
that's equivalent or better, but I just

253
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,600
never ran into it. So, I use it, you

254
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,320
know, I use what I know works. Um I I I

255
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,519
grow in 100% cocoa, but I can grow in

256
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,600
any media. I prefer cocoa over rockwool

257
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,080
just

258
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:02,560
environmentally. Um you have a much more

259
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,080
room for error with cocoa. If there's a

260
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,399
slight error with rockwool, it can cost

261
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,160
you an entire crop. Uh error with cocoa,

262
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,240
you have a you you have a buffer. You

263
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,480
have some room to bounce back. For

264
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,919
instance, like if you didn't w let's say

265
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,519
you missed in a watering event with

266
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,958
cocoa, that can destroy your whole crop.

267
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,679
There's no bringing those plants back

268
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:22,239
once they reach a certain level of

269
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:24,399
dryback, you know. Um, with cocoa, they

270
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,759
can be wilty and you can water and

271
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,159
there'll be enough stiletto in there to

272
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,879
bring them back. Got it. And with that

273
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,319
Athena lines, it's actually I just got

274
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:35,200
my hands on it. I haven't a chance to

275
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,879
run it yet, but I've heard that sticking

276
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,000
to the actual feeding chart is what you

277
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,679
want to do. You don't want to actually

278
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,240
go outside of that. Are you going

279
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,958
outside of that at all or I have my own

280
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,600
special feeding program for Athena 100%.

281
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,599
Um I'm not going to say that I go uh

282
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,959
outside the chart in ter I don't use any

283
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,000
other additives, but I

284
00:10:53,958 --> 00:11:00,239
um I have my own my own style, my own

285
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,360
way that I like to do things. Okay. And

286
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,879
then for flour that you're growing for

287
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,919
competitions, are you doing anything

288
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:10,000
differently on a feeding aspect? No. No.

289
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,919
the same way I I I grow, you know, at

290
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,360
the same way I've always grown my

291
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:14,719
flowers, the same way I grow it for

292
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,240
competitions. I don't do anything

293
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,800
different. Um, I just focus on I think

294
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,480
one of the main things with high quality

295
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,319
flour in my opinion is the drying

296
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,159
process. A lot of people rush that or

297
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,000
flub that and it tends to uh once you

298
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,240
lose turpps, there's no way to bring

299
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,240
them back, right? So, you know, the name

300
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,200
of the game is to preserve the flavor

301
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,519
profile and if you even have one. Um,

302
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,440
but that the N if you have a solid pla

303
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,480
flavor profile and you can preserve that

304
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,800
and it translates into, you know,

305
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,079
smokable flour, then that is going to

306
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:52,000
be something that's going to set you

307
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,319
apart from the rest. And I I I would say

308
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,078
n that's one of the biggest mistakes

309
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,320
that a lot of these growers and grows

310
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,239
and facilities make is rushing the

311
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,839
drying process. If you're drying your

312
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,720
flower in a week, you're doing it too

313
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:06,800
fast and you're going to have a

314
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,639
substandard product in the end. Yeah, a

315
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,519
lot of people they just mess up towards

316
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,720
the end. They get through the whole

317
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,480
growth cycle, all of a sudden they get

318
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,040
into drying and then they they mess

319
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,360
things up and all and and it blows my

320
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:20,480
mind because why would you spend all

321
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,800
this time, all this money, you know,

322
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,560
growing trying to grow the best quality

323
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:29,679
product ever to rush the last week? like

324
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:31,439
dude 10 to 14 days is a proper amount of

325
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,919
time even a little bit longer but I

326
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,480
would say you know 10 to 16 days tops

327
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,159
depending on your uh environmentals in

328
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,440
your dry space. I was going to ask you

329
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,719
about the environment conditions. What

330
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,600
are you aiming for for temperature and

331
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,560
humidity and drying? I like to run 6565

332
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,800
the whole way through. Oh okay. If and

333
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:51,679
that takes you to the 10 to 16 day until

334
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,278
it's dry and then you put it into jars.

335
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,599
Slow dry is what you want to really

336
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:58,159
preserve flavor profile. If you rush it,

337
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,680
you're going to ruin it. It still might

338
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,360
look good. It'll be it'll it'll be

339
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,319
smokable and people will like it, but

340
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,680
it's not going to be what it could have

341
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:09,680
been. It'll never go back. So, slow and

342
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,000
steady is the way to go in my opinion.

343
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:16,078
And then do you take it after drying and

344
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,559
you do a dry trim and then put into jars

345
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:21,278
or do you use grove bags or what's your

346
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,759
storage? After drying, I package ready

347
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,320
for sale. I personally believe that

348
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,879
flour is best when it's freshest. I

349
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,278
don't believe in any threemon you know

350
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:36,240
crazy long month cures.

351
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:39,919
Um about two week dry two week cure

352
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,519
ready for market is is is my my honest

353
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,679
opinion. That's when flour is at its

354
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,600
best. Um I mean but I've also had flour

355
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,519
that I've entered in into competitions

356
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,839
that I've had in my freezer for 6 months

357
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,759
and taken first place. So, uh, I think

358
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,519
knowing how to preserve flour, like

359
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:57,759
knowing when that right time to, um, to

360
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,159
fully package your flour and and have it

361
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,480
like ready to go is is what you need to

362
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,639
do. Got it. I want to back up and talk

363
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,440
about traits. Now, you already talked

364
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,159
about in the competitions that really

365
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,000
flavor was something that stuck out in

366
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,879
yours. Is that all that they're looking

367
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,879
for when it comes to picking a strain

368
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,600
for competition? Or are people looking

369
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:22,000
actually plant structure, potency,

370
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,480
effects, like what what's really

371
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,120
prioritized when it comes to traits? A

372
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,519
lot of these competitions, um, in my

373
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,919
opinion, they look

374
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:34,639
for all of the above. Um, you know, they

375
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,719
look for flavor, they look for

376
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,159
structure. Um, a lot of the ones that I

377
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,839
like to enter, I like to enter

378
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,719
competitions that look for flavor

379
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,639
profile as one of the judging metrics

380
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,278
because in my opinion, I think that's

381
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,198
one of the most important things and one

382
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:52,399
of the things that we've kind of lost in

383
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:55,359
today's recreational world. Uh there's

384
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,679
so many of the same flavor profiles

385
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,720
regardless of name out there that it's

386
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:04,759
just it's just, you know, brought the

387
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:08,079
the industry and my point to a level

388
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:09,838
where there's nothing unique left.

389
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:11,679
Everything is the same. Everything

390
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,360
smells the same, tastes the same, looks

391
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,278
the same. And I'm really trying to step

392
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,519
away from that and bring back things

393
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,838
that I remember. things that I remember

394
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,879
as a connoisseur, like as a teenager,

395
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,399
was always a unique flavor profile. You

396
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,120
know, there's there's flavor profiles

397
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,600
that I can remember right now at 47

398
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,440
years old that I ran into at 16 that I

399
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,800
still haven't seen again, you know. So,

400
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,880
those are the kind of things I'm looking

401
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,799
for, something unique that I've never

402
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,639
seen before. And I look for judging

403
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,039
competitions that have that as a metric

404
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,278
because I believe that's a that's a a

405
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,838
strong way to win because, you know,

406
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:48,879
it's like that that that excellent meal

407
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,720
or that, you know, that superb drink or

408
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,639
whatever it might be that you had that

409
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,399
you it's always flavor pallets that

410
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,079
stick to your memory that really like,

411
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,240
you know, leave that lasting memory in

412
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,479
my opinion. Understood. Yeah. I hear the

413
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,839
same thing from so many people to where

414
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,759
everything just tastes the same these

415
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,560
days. You know, a lot of similar effects

416
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,159
as well. very dull. A lot of people are

417
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:12,239
saying that there's a lot of dull

418
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:14,879
flavor, smell, effects, and that uh it's

419
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,639
really tough to find good stuff these

420
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,799
days. So, well, and I think that's

421
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,600
because a lot of uh you know,

422
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:23,758
recreational, you know, you have two

423
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,000
types of growers. You have a corporate

424
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,759
model, which is a lot of the industry

425
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,399
right now, unfortunately. And corporate

426
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,560
models, they're not in it for the love

427
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,919
of it. They're in it to make money. So,

428
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,439
you know, a lot of those models when

429
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,759
they step into the industry, they're

430
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,600
thinking, uh, what's the best genetic?

431
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,440
Oh, it's gelato. We need gelato. Let's

432
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,199
buy as many gelato clones as we have.

433
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,880
And, you know, and that's why there's so

434
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:46,799
much of that out there. Uh, they're

435
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,480
they're not looking for uniqueness. And

436
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,639
then you have guys like me that really

437
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,399
want to bring, you know, something cool

438
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,560
to the people. So, I think uh guys like

439
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,639
me are going to win out in the long run

440
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,879
cuz the corporate model is not a model

441
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,720
that's sustainable. I hear you. I think

442
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,679
ever since it's gone recreational a lot

443
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,919
of these states it's gotten worse and

444
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,798
going down to being the connoisseur and

445
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,319
and really being craft more craft style

446
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,240
to where you're bringing that uniqueness

447
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:17,038
like you mentioned it's far and few

448
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,359
between. So right corporate model is is

449
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:22,160
not sustainable in this industry at all

450
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:26,119
in my opinion. Yep. Uh it just it's just

451
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,319
not. People want the the people who want

452
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:31,038
quality are the ones who are going to

453
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:33,440
last. Agreed. That's a whole

454
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:36,798
conversation on its own, right? Let's uh

455
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,160
let's get back to growing. I do have a

456
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:39,038
good question here for you that I think

457
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,200
a lot of people are going to want to

458
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:44,440
know the answer to. Lighting. When it

459
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,400
comes to growing these plants for

460
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,480
competitions, are you doing anything

461
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,320
different as far as lighting a

462
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,120
particular strategy that you feel like

463
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:56,240
gives you an edge in quality or tricom

464
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:58,239
development? So, I don't grow uh my

465
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,079
flower any different for competitions

466
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,960
versus like if I was growing it at home

467
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:07,519
for myself. Um I have the same standard

468
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:10,079
throughout, you know. Um but lighting is

469
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:14,079
very important for Tricom development. I

470
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:16,319
I run Thinkrow LEDs, which in my opinion

471
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,000
are one of the more superior lights on

472
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,558
the market today. There might be

473
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,919
something better. Uh there might be

474
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,678
something equivalent, but I don't know

475
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,640
what it is. I haven't run into it yet.

476
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:29,759
So, with that being said, Thinkros are

477
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,960
my go-to lights. They have like the most

478
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:36,400
amazing spectrum tuning, uh, UV, far

479
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,200
red, all those things are important for

480
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,120
and will increase tricom development as

481
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,200
well as a early finish. Uh, you know,

482
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:46,639
you can finish a strain that would

483
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:50,319
normally take 58 days and 52 with the

484
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,480
with proper spectrum tuning. So, um,

485
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,558
which can, you know, significantly

486
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,120
increase profits and yields if you're

487
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,119
looking at it from, um, you know, a

488
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,199
business standpoint. So, are you adding

489
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,879
in UV? You mentioned UV. Are you adding

490
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,679
that in? If so, what's your strategy for

491
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,640
that? 100% I use UV and far red. Uh,

492
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,679
usually I alternate those spectrums the

493
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,280
last 15 minutes

494
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,280
before the plants go to sleep in the

495
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,279
first 15 minutes before they wake up.

496
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,279
So, you'll just get either straight far

497
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,720
red or straight UV just depending on

498
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:24,960
where I'm at and um what exactly I'm

499
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,360
trying to achieve. But the end goal for

500
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,919
all of that is increased tricom

501
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,918
development, increase flavor, early

502
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,720
finish. And the UV and far red, is that

503
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,880
only for the flowering stage? Correct.

504
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,640
Okay. The entire flowering stage or late

505
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,400
flowering only? I use it through the

506
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,600
entire flowering stage. Like I said, I

507
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,440
alternate um when I'm using it depending

508
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,519
on where I'm at and what results I'm

509
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,880
trying to achieve. And then you touched

510
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,720
base, you already mentioned that you

511
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,080
don't really do anything differently for

512
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,519
flower that you're entering into

513
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:57,519
competitions versus your own personal

514
00:19:53,519 --> 00:20:00,639
grow. No. So for your environment, what

515
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:05,038
conditions are you typically aiming for?

516
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,880
Um, in terms of temperature, humidity, I

517
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,679
mean, it really just depends on where

518
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:14,320
I'm at, but I usually keep temperature

519
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,919
around, you know, between like 78 and 82

520
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:19,599
degrees, just depending on where I'm at

521
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:22,759
in the flowering stage. And humidity can

522
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:25,119
vary as well, anywhere from 60 to

523
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,480
50% just depending on where I'm at in

524
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,239
the flowering stage. I I make

525
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,839
adjustments daily according

526
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,240
to environmental readings, according to

527
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:36,798
runoff, like you know, little things get

528
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,480
adjusted usually daily. So, it's not I

529
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:43,119
don't really have I can't say I have a

530
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:45,839
set 100% set SOP for how I grow. Things

531
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:48,399
can be adjusted, you know, according to

532
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,558
how the environmentals are in play

533
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,080
daily. Interesting. Okay. So, you really

534
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,879
It sounds like you're really fine-tuning

535
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,639
things day by day. Now, how about CO2?

536
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,919
Are you supplementing that at all or no?

537
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,038
100%. CO2 is a must in my opinion for

538
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,600
especially if you're running uh high

539
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:07,119
PPFD. Um people need to remember that

540
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,719
more you turn your lights up, the more

541
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:12,000
you should turn your CO2 up. Those

542
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,519
things, those two CO2 and PPFD should

543
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,480
always correlate. And then what do you

544
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:19,359
typically aim for for a ppm of CO2?

545
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,679
Right around 1500. But like again those

546
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,519
adjustments are usually made like I'll

547
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,559
make adjustments in CO2 levels

548
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:29,440
throughout the weeks. So anywhere from

549
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,200
1100 you know 1500 or more just

550
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,840
depending on what I'm trying to achieve.

551
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,360
Okay. Yeah I've heard of uh studies

552
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,720
around that range. I think it was

553
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:40,558
like400 ppm was uh like a 30% increase

554
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,558
in yield or something crazy like that.

555
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:45,119
So yeah supplementing CO2 you can

556
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:47,440
definitely get a increased amount in

557
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,879
yield. uh you just got to make sure that

558
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,400
obviously your other conditions are

559
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,720
fine-tuned as well. You increase the

560
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,720
light levels and environment is dialed

561
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,798
in, nutrition and all that stuff.

562
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,960
Another important factor is uh under

563
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:00,319
canopy air flow. A lot of people don't

564
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,480
uh you know take that into

565
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,079
consideration, but the more air flow

566
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,640
that you have in your room, the better

567
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:09,279
and healthier your plants will be and

568
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,600
the more they'll respond positively to

569
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,038
the rest of your environment. That's a

570
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:14,319
really good point. Yeah, I definitely

571
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,558
think that's one thing that a lot of

572
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:19,119
people sleep on is the under canopy air

573
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,798
flow. Yes. Get air flow in the root

574
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:22,959
zone. They love it. Now, how about

575
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,960
precision stress techniques? Are you

576
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,319
doing anything throughout the grow that

577
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,558
is, you know, I have before? I think

578
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:34,240
precision stress techniques work really

579
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:35,839
well for a smaller grow, you know. Um,

580
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,919
but I think when you start getting into

581
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,519
larger facilities, it just becomes a

582
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,840
tedious thing that doesn't really

583
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,759
produce that much more for the workload

584
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,158
that you have to put into it. Like if

585
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,720
you're a guy with an 8x8 tent, yeah,

586
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,400
pinching stems and bending branches can

587
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,558
really help you increase what you can

588
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,640
get out of that space. If you're, you

589
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,480
know, working with, you know, a 500

590
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,720
light canopy, it's a waste of time. How

591
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,200
about like drought stress and stuff like

592
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,079
that? Absolutely. Dryback stress is is

593
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,558
definitely something that uh um

594
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:09,279
increases, you know, growth. Uh you

595
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,879
know, just it just depends on like how

596
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:13,440
fine-tuned and precision you can get

597
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,159
with that stuff. I personally prefer

598
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,000
hand watering, but I'm, you know, I can

599
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,080
run irrigation as well. It's not a, you

600
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,440
know, I've I've done it all. Um, I

601
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,599
prefer hand watering because I like to

602
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,159
be up and close and personal with my

603
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,918
plants. But, you know, past a certain

604
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,360
size, again, it's just not practical.

605
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,159
So, then you have to turn to something

606
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:33,839
like irrigation strategies. And they can

607
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,919
work great, too. You know, I think I've

608
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,000
come up with some really good formulas

609
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,880
for irrigation strategies and I've seen

610
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,279
them work well in multiple large scale

611
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,200
facilities that I currently consult for.

612
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:48,000
Can you give us an example at all or is

613
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,038
it just kind of vary by grow? It varies

614
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,440
by grow 100%. 100%. It really just

615
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:56,158
varies by grow because you have to

616
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,919
tailor it to in the environment. You

617
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,440
can't just be like, you know, this is

618
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,038
how you do it and and think it's going

619
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,840
to work like that anywhere cuz that's

620
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:05,440
really not the case. Understood. Yeah.

621
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:07,038
Speaking from a small home grower

622
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,400
perspective, that's that's me. I feel

623
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:09,919
like that's a majority of the audience

624
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,440
as well that are kind of listening into

625
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,200
this. A lot of things that people are

626
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,400
using now are the moisture meters. The

627
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,798
AC Infiniti has one, Ecoit has one. Uh,

628
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,720
but being able to see a percentage of

629
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:22,240
moisture in the medium has been helpful

630
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,720
for me and I know it's been helpful for

631
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,038
a lot of people. So using that as a tool

632
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,319
to kind of measure drybacks is something

633
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:29,759
I'm currently kind of playing with a

634
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,000
little bit more. Yeah, my way was always

635
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,240
lifting pots. Lifting pots. The lighter

636
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,159
the pot, you know, then we're the closer

637
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,079
we are to getting to watering. So

638
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,240
that was, you know, always my go-to. But

639
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,918
yeah, moisture sensors definitely. I

640
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,679
mean, if you even get fancy, you know,

641
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,759
like they have Growlink and stuff like

642
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,278
that where it's all AI controlled.

643
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:53,038
There's a lot of I think we're

644
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:55,038
definitely heading into um a future in

645
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:58,960
the industry where a lot of things are

646
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:01,599
going to be like high uh proficiency,

647
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,759
you know, uh computer models that are

648
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,319
just going to do everything

649
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:10,079
automatically. And um you know, so I'm

650
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:12,158
I'm hoping to kind of beat all that out

651
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,918
and and kind of get you know, what I

652
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,600
know how to do out there before

653
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,840
everything becomes too automated and

654
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,278
because I feel like it's going to be

655
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:20,959
pretty much like all other corporate

656
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,919
models. It's going to produce, but it's

657
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,759
not going to produce good quality. But

658
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,120
who knows? I mean, AI is is is

659
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:30,798
definitely being integrated into

660
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,959
everything. Maybe they'll come up with

661
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,960
an AI that produces, you know, the

662
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,880
highest quality. We'll see. Yeah, it'll

663
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,400
be really interesting to see what comes

664
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,919
forth in the future here. I mean, I

665
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,038
think a lot of people are scared to kind

666
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,480
of see what comes of it. If I can get

667
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:48,240
some robot trimmers in the house, let's

668
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,720
go finish the whole finish the whole

669
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,000
room in 24 hours. Just work through the

670
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,400
night. Oh, that'd be fantastic. Yeah.

671
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,558
So, the final weeks of the grow are

672
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,080
arguably the most important weeks,

673
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:01,759
right? One of the common strategies that

674
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,439
a lot of people do is they'll they'll

675
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,119
lower the temperature in the final weeks

676
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,759
of flowering in order to try to conserve

677
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,798
those tarpen when you're growing. And I

678
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,640
know you said you mentioned your

679
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:13,200
personal grows are the same way you grow

680
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,640
for competitions. Correct. What do you

681
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,440
do in those final weeks in order to make

682
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:23,520
sure you have the highest quality smell,

683
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:26,558
flavor, and bag appeal? So, I think uh a

684
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,639
lot of those things, you know, it's it's

685
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:31,200
a it's a combination of things. It's not

686
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,440
just what you do in the grow, but do you

687
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,919
even have a good feno that has those

688
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,360
qualities in the beginning? So, if you

689
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,520
have a good feno that has those

690
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,678
qualities, okay, how can we preserve

691
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:44,918
them? And and yeah, uh lower

692
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,679
temperatures the final couple weeks,

693
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:49,360
but not really much more than that. I

694
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,840
would say even more important what you

695
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:54,558
do the final few weeks is after you

696
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:56,480
harvest, those last two weeks of drying

697
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:59,839
is the most important to preserve

698
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,240
flavor. look, you know, tricoms, how you

699
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,558
trim, do you are you are you, you know,

700
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,240
fisting every every nug or you holding

701
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:09,839
stems while you trim? All those things

702
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:13,599
play a part into quality at the end, you

703
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:15,119
know? So, you can have all the SOPs in

704
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,719
the world, but if you don't even have a

705
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,719
good fo, you're not going you're never

706
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,000
going to achieve that look, that taste,

707
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,000
that quality. You're always going to

708
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,359
grow something that's like a little bit

709
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,480
less than that. And you're wondering,

710
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,000
you know, what do I need to do

711
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,079
different? Well, maybe it's the genetic

712
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,679
from the beginning. you know, and maybe

713
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,079
you have a great genetic and know your

714
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,320
SOPs aren't correct. So, you I would

715
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:36,879
figure out which one it is first before

716
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,038
you say, um, you know, this isn't

717
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,360
working for me or I I can't achieve

718
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:43,839
these results like why can't you achieve

719
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:46,158
those results? Is it you? Is it the

720
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,839
plant? Or is it both? And are you

721
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:51,520
willing to accept that? One of one of

722
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:54,759
the I think one of the biggest uh

723
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:57,599
roadblocks for growers is

724
00:27:54,759 --> 00:28:00,000
ego. You know, nobody wants to admit

725
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,519
that they have an ugly baby, right? Like

726
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,880
that's your that's your kid. That came

727
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:04,398
from you. That's like you don't want to

728
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,520
you're not gonna call your kid ugly, do

729
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:07,918
you're going to love that kid, right?

730
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,480
Like nobody wants to do that. But the

731
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,240
reality is not every kid's going to be

732
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,759
beautiful. And if you can admit that to

733
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,440
yourself, you don't have to admit it to

734
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,359
everyone else. If you can admit that to

735
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,640
yourself, you can you have the ability

736
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:22,879
to grow as a grower and become something

737
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,679
better than what you are.

738
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,679
So me personally, I always try to leave

739
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,840
ego at the door. I'm always ready to

740
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,600
learn something new. If you show me

741
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:34,798
better than what I do, I'm all

742
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:37,798
ears. You know, if you can show me

743
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:40,000
equivalent to what I do, you have all my

744
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:41,679
respect. But if you're showing me less

745
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,919
than what I do, I don't really have time

746
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:48,000
for that respectfully, right? So I'm

747
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,360
here to learn. So if I' if you're

748
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,798
showing me less than what I do, you

749
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,158
can't teach me anything. And it's not

750
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:53,720
that I don't I think I'm better than

751
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,480
you, but I'm here to

752
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,399
learn, you

753
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,640
know. So, that's my philosophy in in the

754
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:03,359
garden. I'm I'm here to learn and I want

755
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,440
to learn from, you know, anybody that

756
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:06,959
can teach me something I don't know. And

757
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,720
there's what seems like an endless

758
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,640
amount of things to learn in this

759
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,399
industry since science is continuing to

760
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,520
uncover new things. And for me

761
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:15,599
personally, that's what makes this

762
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,720
working in the space so exciting because

763
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:18,240
there's always something to learn,

764
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,880
always something fresh. It's not just

765
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,079
rinse and repeat every single grow.

766
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,320
There's so many different ways you can

767
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,079
grow this plant. And uh yeah, I take a

768
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,158
similar approach to you on that way on

769
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:30,079
that avenue where I'm always learning as

770
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,840
well. Yes. And there's more than one

771
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,519
avenue to success. You know, you got

772
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:34,879
your organic guys, you got your salt

773
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:36,480
guys. I'm not hating. You got your

774
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,720
synganic guys. I'm not hating on

775
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,480
anybody's methods. I know I just know

776
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,000
what works best for me and I like to

777
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,079
stick to that. But there's more than one

778
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,200
way to skin a cat and there's multiple

779
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:49,519
ways to success with the plant. 100%.

780
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,000
So, we talked about the final weeks. How

781
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,759
about flushing? A lot of salt growers,

782
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,679
what they'll do is they'll do a flush

783
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,119
prior to harvesting. Now, first of all,

784
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,159
there are so many definitions of

785
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:01,918
flushing. It's it's mindboggling. What

786
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,919
is your definition of flush? And do you

787
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,480
flush before harvesting? My definition

788
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,520
of flushing is bringing the EC in the

789
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:13,679
media

790
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:15,278
under.5. Um, so I do flush. Absolutely.

791
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,200
And I usually like to flush like the

792
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:20,880
last 3 to 4 days with, you know,

793
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,720
straight pH RO water, no nutrients, you

794
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,799
know, and just rinse everything out.

795
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,399
Bring the bring the EC all the way down.

796
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:31,440
But usually the last few weeks of

797
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:34,079
flower, I'm bringing the EC down slowly

798
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,480
anyway. So by the time I hit flush, I'm

799
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,038
probably at around 2 EC and I'll drag it

800
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,038
all the way down to.5 over the last four

801
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:42,558
or five days, depending on the media. If

802
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,319
you're in Rockwell, it's comes down a

803
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:45,839
little quicker. If you're in cocoa,

804
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:48,079
usually about four or five days, the

805
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,240
last four or five days. And by then, you

806
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,678
know, you're seeing dark purples and and

807
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,240
the color should just be busting

808
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,200
everywhere in the garden. Okay. And then

809
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,798
are you a firm believer that flushing

810
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:04,600
will lead to the color of the ash being

811
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:06,720
white versus black or

812
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:08,240
um I don't know. I think there's some

813
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,240
studies out there that kind of have

814
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,640
disproved that. I think it kind of boils

815
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,880
down to how much uh you know um calcium

816
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:21,080
and you have left in your in your in

817
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,520
your media. Um but I

818
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:25,359
don't you know the whole flushing like

819
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,558
there's been a there was a I can't

820
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:28,719
remember who did it but there was a

821
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:32,000
study out where you know they didn't

822
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,759
flush any flower and they did a blind

823
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
test with flower they did flush and

824
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,119
people picked the flower that wasn't

825
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,880
flushed 100% of the time.

826
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:43,278
So, you know, and that that was done by

827
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,399
RX Green Technologies, and they are a

828
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:47,599
nutrient manufacturer. Okay. No, that

829
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:49,119
makes sense. A little more context

830
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:50,319
there. Yep. Don't flush. Okay, that

831
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:51,759
makes sense. I need a little more

832
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,119
context on that when I just heard that

833
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:56,319
and I thought, huh, interesting. But

834
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:57,599
yeah, that that kind of makes more

835
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:59,038
sense. Of course, people who want to

836
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:00,879
sell you nutrients are going to tell you

837
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:02,480
it's it's fine. Put as much in there all

838
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,840
the way till the end. But yeah, I just

839
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,319
wanted to ask you that, get your take on

840
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:08,639
that. I know that it's very split, very

841
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,558
um still debated. I probably flush

842
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,000
because I've always done it in the 25

843
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:13,200
years that I've been growing. And I

844
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,759
guess it's one of those things whether

845
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,600
it be truthful that it that it works or

846
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,000
not. I know that it's kind of just

847
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:22,240
ingrained in my DNA. And I if I I don't

848
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,839
like to do things like what I'm what I'm

849
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,679
doing works, right? So I don't like to

850
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,439
do things opposite of what I've always

851
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,440
do because if what I'm doing works, I

852
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,960
don't I don't need to change anything.

853
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,720
Makes perfect sense. And it's clearly

854
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,120
not detrimental. and you're winning grow

855
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,720
competitions doing it that way. So, when

856
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,959
you're harvesting, are there any

857
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,519
specific techniques that you do to

858
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,880
preserve tarpen and avoid damaging those

859
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,759
tricoms? Uh, yeah. When I when I when I

860
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,360
I try not to touch the

861
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:51,278
flower, you know, when trimming, just

862
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:53,199
try to hold stems while you're trimming.

863
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:56,319
I like to hand trim. I don't machine

864
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,080
trim anything ever. Um, I believe in the

865
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:00,319
time that it takes to hand trim. Again,

866
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,079
we're I, you know, I'll I'll digress

867
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:03,359
back

868
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:06,038
to why are you going to spend all this

869
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,558
time and all this money growing the best

870
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:10,319
possible product you can only to throw

871
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:13,519
it in a machine and have it chop it up

872
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:15,200
and and you know, I I prefer a hand trim

873
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,558
absolutely every time. And I think that

874
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,640
preserves quality. As a matter of fact,

875
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,398
I know it does. Personally, and I know I

876
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,159
haven't used every single machine

877
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:25,199
trimmer out there, but they don't do as

878
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,960
good of a job generally as a hand trim,

879
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,798
right? And if you're taking that flower

880
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,399
and you're entering into a competition,

881
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,599
well, you want that to look as pretty as

882
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:33,439
possible, right? Cuz a lot of these

883
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,918
competitions are are going after bag

884
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,640
appeal as well. Correct. Now, what about

885
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:41,840
the testing? Is there like like how much

886
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,000
does lab testing matter in competitions?

887
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:48,079
Most competitions that I enter don't

888
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,159
require it. Uh but you know I don't I'm

889
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:52,480
not a believer in I don't like to enter

890
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:56,559
competitions that require you know where

891
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:59,038
uh a percentage is a metric you know I I

892
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:01,278
that's not because some of the best

893
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:05,038
flower that I've had you know had you

894
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:07,119
know a percentage of 17 18%. You know

895
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:09,280
versus some and I think a lot of labs

896
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:11,838
flub these numbers. I think a lot of

897
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,519
them inflate numbers, you know, because

898
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:16,559
if if your business is to sell

899
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:18,320
results, you know, you make the results

900
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:20,320
look good, they keep coming back. Yeah.

901
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,039
I've had so much flour where was like

902
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:26,079
lower THC, like I would say lower, but

903
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,119
like around 15% THC, and then you put it

904
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,079
side by side with something that was

905
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,639
like 25% THC, and you get more wrecked

906
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,039
off of the 15% THC. So, it's it's not

907
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,200
all about THC. And there's so many

908
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,838
cannibaloids we haven't studied yet as

909
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,519
well. Yeah. Yep. One of the biggest

910
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:44,239
misconceptions out there is that it's

911
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:46,800
all about THC when really it's there's a

912
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:49,358
lot more to it than that, right? What do

913
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,320
you think is one detail that most

914
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,878
growers overlook when preparing for a

915
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,440
contest?

916
00:34:53,878 --> 00:35:00,400
um

917
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,880
uniqueness. You know, I I you it's hard

918
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,400
for someone

919
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,599
to know what's good when you've never

920
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,280
seen anything better than what you've

921
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:11,280
seen. You know, I think there's an

922
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,440
experience that comes into play. I think

923
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,960
that's why, you know, I've been able to

924
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,320
win the things that I've won is because

925
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,400
I have 47 years under my belt. And of

926
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,039
those 47 years, I probably spent at

927
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,200
least 30 plus, you know, as a

928
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,679
connoisseur of the highest grade and

929
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:29,679
always s sought that out. No matter

930
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:31,440
where I live, no matter where I was, I

931
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:34,440
was growing it, I was looking for it, I

932
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,920
was smoking it. So,

933
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:40,960
um, and just I guess my ability to to

934
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,480
recall flavor pallets in my memory has,

935
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,000
you know, is one of the things I believe

936
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,800
that gives me an edge. So, I think

937
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,519
that's one thing that if if growers can

938
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,720
increase your mental

939
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:55,440
library of flavors beyond what you're

940
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,879
normally used to can give you an edge in

941
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,960
competition because when you bring

942
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,559
something new, that's what wins.

943
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,480
Something new, something special,

944
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,320
something different, that's what wins.

945
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,639
Absolutely. I believe I'm going to be

946
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,440
going to the DGC cup. Are you going this

947
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,960
year? I I am not going this year, but um

948
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,280
you know, I thought about entering and I

949
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,199
think I might enter next year. That'd be

950
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,720
awesome. Yeah, that's been around for

951
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:18,399
several years now. It seems like it's

952
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:22,399
getting better and better. I wanted to

953
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,800
ask your opinion on judging. Uh if you

954
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,559
have any feedback for me going into

955
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,880
this, basically they're going to give

956
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,159
you uh they give everybody a little

957
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,079
chillum or whatever and you can go

958
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:33,679
around and sample everything. How do you

959
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,560
judge something like that with when you

960
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:38,960
have so many samples? It's so hard. Like

961
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:42,320
literally, I go for the sample that

962
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:45,119
stands out the most first. Nose. nose

963
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,359
first because after you, you know, you

964
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,880
sample however many, you're going to be

965
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:51,199
like, "It all tastes and smells the

966
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,119
same." So, uh, if you have all the

967
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,439
samples in front of you at one time, I

968
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,039
would smell everything first, then go

969
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,440
from there. The ones that smell the

970
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:01,199
best, put those to the side, try those

971
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,519
first. The ones that have no smell,

972
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,358
they've already lost in my opinion. You

973
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:07,280
know, if there's no flavor pie, you

974
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:09,598
already lost. Out of there. or if

975
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,760
there's like 10 jars and eight of them

976
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,200
smell the same, the eight out of there.

977
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,200
I'll go I'm going to go with the two

978
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,279
that smell completely different and

979
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,039
unique. Pretty straightforward there.

980
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,560
Yeah, that that's really good advice.

981
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:22,079
That's smelling them all first. Yeah,

982
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:24,719
I'm going to have to because you're

983
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,280
you're cuz that you know your your

984
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:28,799
oldactory senses are going to stay for a

985
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,640
while. So, you can you can definitely

986
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,079
get the different flavor profiles just

987
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:34,159
through your nose and you know we taste

988
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,079
with our smell. So, you're going to get

989
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:38,078
the full flavor like that first and then

990
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,839
like I the ones that stand out there are

991
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,680
the ones that I would like to try for

992
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:44,078
sure. And if that smell translates to

993
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:46,960
smoke, that's definitely along the lines

994
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,039
of a winner. Got it. Yeah. You bring up

995
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,320
uh something that reminds me of I was

996
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:52,960
smelling a whole bunch of different

997
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,119
flowers not too long ago working with a

998
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,599
breeder on a collaboration and uh one

999
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,000
thing we did between smelling was we

1000
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,838
smelled some coffee. Holy cleanser was

1001
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,159
great. Yeah, probably maybe some

1002
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,599
mothballs or something. I don't know.

1003
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:07,679
Something like that might work though,

1004
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,920
for sure. Yeah. So, I think I'll

1005
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:13,039
probably go to DGC with uh with a little

1006
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,720
K cup of coffee in between each sample.

1007
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:17,279
You smelling that? Yeah, that could

1008
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:18,399
definitely work. For sure. So, I know

1009
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,320
there's a lot of people here that are

1010
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,720
tuning in that they're looking to enter

1011
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,559
in competitions. What's the biggest p

1012
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,679
piece of advice you have for someone who

1013
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:29,119
wants to enter in a competition?

1014
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:31,000
Um, try to have something different than

1015
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,000
the rest.

1016
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,400
Um, you know, be confident in in the

1017
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,480
quality of your product. Like have be

1018
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,119
honest with

1019
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:44,079
yourself about what you have. Uh, I

1020
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,760
can't, you know, I see I see it. So, but

1021
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,519
like again, I'll just go back to nobody

1022
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,880
wants to say they have an ugly baby, you

1023
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:51,119
know, like no, nobody's going to do

1024
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,480
that. Even if you but if you can admit

1025
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,240
it to yourself, you don't have to scream

1026
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,240
it out loud to everybody, but if you can

1027
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:58,399
admit to yourself that you might need to

1028
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:01,118
work on your skill level to really

1029
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,800
compete, that's that's probably the best

1030
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,440
piece of advice that I could give. Be

1031
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,519
honest with yourself about what you do.

1032
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,000
Never tell yourself you're the best. Let

1033
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:11,519
other people tell you

1034
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,920
that. And if a lot of other people tell

1035
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,519
you you're the best, take it to

1036
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,119
competitions and see if you're really

1037
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,280
the best. I think that's a good way to

1038
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,760
go about it. They mentioned the ugly

1039
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,040
baby thing and one thing that uh reminds

1040
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,800
me of are these ugly plants I grew and I

1041
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:28,400
you probably gotten these ugly plants

1042
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,160
before where there's like some sort of

1043
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,760
weird mutation or something. I swear

1044
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:36,000
these ugly plants some of them turn out

1045
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:39,599
to be fire like really good nugs dense

1046
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,599
frosty flavor smell incredible. So,

1047
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,440
well, what what what I mean by the ugly

1048
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,519
baby is not necessarily appearance, but

1049
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,599
it's more of this is something I

1050
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:49,280
created, right? And no one like it's

1051
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,519
like I'll give you another analogy, like

1052
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,200
a chef, like no, you know, you got

1053
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:54,159
certain chefs out there like no matter

1054
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,319
what they make, they're going to tell

1055
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,920
you it's good. Even if it's not, just

1056
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,838
because it's something they created. And

1057
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,159
a lot of times when people put time and

1058
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:03,759
work and energy into something, they

1059
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:05,838
never want to admit to themselves that

1060
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,240
it might be subpar to what everything

1061
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:09,838
else out there of people doing the same

1062
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,838
thing as you. They want to say, "No,

1063
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:14,078
mine's is the best. Mine's is just as

1064
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:16,078
good as yours." Even if it's not, you

1065
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:19,200
know, or mine is better than yours when

1066
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,519
it's clearly not, you know. So, again,

1067
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:25,598
being honest with yourself is, you know,

1068
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:27,599
the first step to success. Be true. You

1069
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,960
know, if I I can't I'm my worst own

1070
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,240
worst critic. There's a lot of times

1071
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,760
where I'm like, I know this ain't good

1072
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,679
enough. I can't tell you how many fenos

1073
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,720
I've thrown in the trash.

1074
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:38,399
Thousands. You know, be honest with

1075
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:40,078
yourself about just because you put time

1076
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,680
and energy and work into something

1077
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,599
doesn't mean it's going to be good.

1078
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:45,000
Doesn't mean it's a winner. Doesn't mean

1079
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,680
it's

1080
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,679
beautiful. You know, it can be all those

1081
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:53,399
things to you, but if it's not all those

1082
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:56,799
things to everyone else, you don't have

1083
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,720
anything. respectfully. Well said, man.

1084
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,480
This podcast episode has been very

1085
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:02,719
insightful for me. I've definitely

1086
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,800
learned quite a bit of things about you

1087
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:07,039
and how you grow your plants and little

1088
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,280
things about competitions and even to we

1089
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:11,358
got to the point of judging, some advice

1090
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,720
on judging competitions. So, I

1091
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:14,960
appreciate you coming on to the podcast

1092
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:16,559
today and sharing your insights with us.

1093
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,838
Let's wrap things up here. Can you tell

1094
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:19,358
the listeners how they could find you

1095
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:21,039
and is there anything upcoming in the

1096
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:23,039
future that you got going on that you

1097
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:25,358
want to talk about? Yeah. Uh, the

1098
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:28,159
easiest way to find me is on Instagram

1099
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:29,679
at Mile Highday420. Uh, might be a

1100
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:31,920
little shadowban, so you have to type in

1101
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:34,078
the whole thing, but I'm fairly easy to

1102
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:39,039
find. Only one with the blue check mark.

1103
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:41,519
Um, I would say coming up are for me,

1104
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:44,079
um, competition wise, I I definitely

1105
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:46,159
plan on doing the Connect Community

1106
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,318
Battle Royale again. I would like to get

1107
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:51,598
in some more licensed competitions in

1108
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:53,920
the state. um they just had the THC

1109
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,359
Classic not too long ago, so we'll see.

1110
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,240
But I'm always going to be looking to

1111
00:41:55,358 --> 00:42:00,559
compete no matter where I'm at. Um I'm

1112
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:03,519
also going to be spending a few months

1113
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:06,000
out of the year down in Argentina um

1114
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:08,000
growing down there at a medical facility

1115
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,318
and uh putting out the flavors to the

1116
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,159
people in South America. So, I'm really

1117
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,400
looking forward to that as well. Mary

1118
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:16,000
Jane in Germany in uh in June. I'll be

1119
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,440
there as well. Man, I've been wanting to

1120
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,679
go to that. I'm not gonna be able to

1121
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,519
make it this year, but I know so many

1122
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,279
people going to that. So, that should be

1123
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:25,440
a good one. I'm entering that this year

1124
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,960
and I'm looking to to take home the gold

1125
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,440
if I can. I think I have some really

1126
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,199
strong contenders, so we'll see. Well,

1127
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,440
good luck, man. I'll be rooting for you

1128
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:35,358
for sure. Thank you. I'll have a link to

1129
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,720

folks supporting on Patreon.

1138
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:54,639
patreon.com/mrgrowit. 100% of what is

1139
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,640
donated through Patreon goes right back

1140
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:58,159
to the podcast. The folks are being

1141
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,239
scrolled on the screen right now or in

1142
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,838
the producer tier. Special thanks to you

1143
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:03,118
for your support. Dave, once again,

1144
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:04,318
thanks so much for coming on, man. This

1145
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,318
has been awesome. Something a little

1146
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:08,000
different than uh than what I usually do

1147
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:09,759
on the podcast. Not sure how familiar

1148
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,079
you are with it, but entering

1149
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,839
competitions. This is a brand new topic

1150
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,519
that we've never done before. So, thank

1151
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:17,358
you so much for coming on and sharing

1152
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:18,800
your insights with us. Thanks for having

1153
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:20,559
me. All right, everyone. We will leave

1154
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,318
it at that. Thank you so much for tuning

1155
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:24,318
in. I'll catch you in the next episode.
