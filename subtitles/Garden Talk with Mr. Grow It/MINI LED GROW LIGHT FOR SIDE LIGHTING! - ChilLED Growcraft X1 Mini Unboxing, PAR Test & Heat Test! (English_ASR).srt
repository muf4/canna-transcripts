and in this video i am going to unbox

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,198
the unit i will test the power output

10
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,480
and i'll do a heat test on it i'm not

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,520
going to go over all of the features

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,960
that this grow light has

13
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,559

17
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,640
okay first thing out the box are these

18
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,879
cables one of the cables is an

19
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,399
extension cable that goes from the led

20
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,000
grow light to the driver

21
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,840
and then there's a cable that goes from

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,840
the driver to the wall outlet

23
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,640
in this bag there is a dimmer and

24
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,640
there's also two rope ratchet hangers

25
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:50,079
in this box is the meanwhile driver

26
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,679
and lastly is the fixture

27
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,280
chilled led is actually giving one of

28
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,520
these away and they're also giving away

29
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,359
an

30
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,120
x1 i'll leave a link to the giveaway

31
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,640
down in the description section below

32
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,799
you can click on that to learn more

33
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,399
about the giveaway and to join it

34
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,759
for the part test i'm going to use the

35
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,239
apogee mq620 extended rage par meter

36
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,760
this meter measures from 340 nanometers

37
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,759
to 1040 nanometers

38
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,520
and the measurements are in ppfd this

39
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,280
part test isn't meant to be exact

40
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,039
it's meant to give you a general idea

41
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,719
for what the power output is

42
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,479
especially since this is for side

43
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,000
lighting like i mentioned earlier

44
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,079
i take measurements and grow tents that

45
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,719
have reflective walls that will increase

46
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,959
the numbers

47
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,158
so just keep that in mind as you saw

48
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,078
when i unbox the light

49
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,359
this light does come with a dimmer i

50
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,759
didn't plug the dimmer in

51
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,959
so the grow light is operating at 100

52
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,159
for this part test

53
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,158
i'll take measurements at three

54
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,520
different distances 12 inches

55
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,359
18 inches and 24 inches i plugged the

56
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,239
led grill light into my kilowatt meter

57
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,640
and it shows

58
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,519
0.56 amps pulling 67.5 watts from the

59
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,560
wall

60
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,560
all right let's get into the

61
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840
measurements
