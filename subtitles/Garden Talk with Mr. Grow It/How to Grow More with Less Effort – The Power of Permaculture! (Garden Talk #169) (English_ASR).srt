00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:47,519
applying it not just on a small scale

75
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,799
but a medium or a larger scale and I'm

76
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,439
eager to kind of dig into learn more

77
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,200
about you what you've been doing on your

78
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,680
farm recently and really some of the

79
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:57,679
techniques that you go through in order

80
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,000
to grow your plants but first can we do

81
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,599
an introduction can you tell us a little

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,280
bit about yourself and how you got into

83
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:05,039
gardening yeah sure well thanks for

84
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,959
having me super stoked to be here and

85
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:11,919
share with all your listeners uh these

86
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:14,840
are topics I'm super passionate about um

87
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:17,639
my start in

88
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,680
agriculture really regenerative more as

89
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:22,439
a lifestyle really than just an

90
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,120
occupation or anything else um I would

91
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:29,598
say that started

92
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:32,560
um back in about 2008 2009 I had kind of

93
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:35,598
a a past life as a draftsman I worked a

94
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,280
desk job um worked for an architectural

95
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,598
firm so was really into kind of systems

96
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,360
thinking and coming up with blueprints

97
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:46,000
well for those that remember that year

98
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,040
um there was there was a collapse of the

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,639
economy the construction industry was

100
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:56,280
really bad I found myself without a

101
00:03:51,639 --> 00:04:00,479
career and at the time it was kind of um

102
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,400
you know it was a a tragedy but you know

103
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,399
turned out to be a course correction in

104
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,879
my life for me a window of opportunity

105
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,879
to basically Venture into a completely

106
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:16,599
new field and occupation literally a

107
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:19,560
field um and you know long story

108
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,560
short you know there back then there was

109
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:27,199
this feeling of like wow like the

110
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:30,399
economy collapsed um what do I do now um

111
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,560
and so it just felt really like this is

112
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,959
you know these systems in society are

113
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,918
not working they're collapsing and so

114
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,000
how do we live like more regeneratively

115
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,399
more

116
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,079
sustainably uh more in tune with nature

117
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:47,159
and that really put me on the path and

118
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:50,879
so I had the opportunity to move out to

119
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,439
Humble County California in

120
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,839
2011 uh my sister lived out there her

121
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,560
and her husband they had a family out

122
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:01,038
there and um specifically my

123
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,639
brother-in-law offered me an opportunity

124
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:08,478
to come and work with medicinal plants

125
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,879
uh get a job on a farm out there and so

126
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:15,360
I took that opportunity and that really

127
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:18,719
started a whole kind of um chapter of

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,879
Awakening in my life you might say um

129
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,319
that led me into you know wild crafting

130
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:27,319
uh spending a lot of time in the forest

131
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,280
uh I took some herbalism courses and

132
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:34,000
learned a lot um

133
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:37,439
you know found myself living in the Lost

134
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,600
Coast for a season uh in Humble County

135
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,160
and lived in an army tent so lived off

136
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,840
grid so you're kind of forced to like

137
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,080
learn how to be

138
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,638
sustainable and you know live off the

139
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,959
land and that kind of settings so wild

140
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,639
crafting foraging for mushrooms plants

141
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:58,638
using medicinal

142
00:05:53,639 --> 00:06:00,560
trees um so that was all kind of um

143
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,639
within the permaculture realm so it kind

144
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,959
of led me down that rabbit hole which

145
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,439
led me into you know Korean natural

146
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:11,959
farming uh and just the whole

147
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:14,279
regenerative farming in general is is a

148
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:16,519
large broad umbrella I mean there's so

149
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:19,519
many different methodologies even under

150
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:22,839
regenerative farming and so I've never

151
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:25,839
felt married to any one of those uh so

152
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:28,359
for me it's always been looking for like

153
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,318
the principles behind them all and

154
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,439
Universal languages

155
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,479
because I'm sure you've noticed and a

156
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:36,120
lot lot of your listeners have noticed

157
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,758
like within Korean natural farming

158
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,399
there's all these acronyms within

159
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,400
biodynamics you have all these acronyms

160
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:46,000
within Copic Agro forestry they use a

161
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:47,079
lot of terminology and permaculture has

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,079
its own

163
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:51,639
terminology you know so and then you get

164
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,918
into the soil food web and microbiology

165
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,360
and so it could be all really complex

166
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,839
but if we're distilling it down into

167
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,400
principles it it kind of makes it a lot

168
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:04,519
easier to approach and we can can we can

169
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:06,799
see where the there's overlaps instead

170
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:09,959
of differences instead of language that

171
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,840
is creating Division and in technical

172
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:15,079
kind of groupy you know areas where

173
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,758
we're siloing information it becomes way

174
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:19,399
more inclusive that

175
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,598
way so that's kind of in a

176
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:23,758
nutshell um you know went down that

177
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:28,360
rabbit hole that took me up into

178
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:31,000
Oregon um you know Consulting for farms

179
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:35,080
in you know medic

180
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,519
um settings in hemp Fields uh you know

181
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:41,318
did 10 acres of hemp with Korean naturo

182
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:43,758
farming in jadam using some permaculture

183
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:47,039
techniques you know along the way I've

184
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:50,960
worked in indoors green houses

185
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:56,120
Outdoors um from you know a five lighter

186
00:07:50,959 --> 00:08:00,598
in my garage to like I said 10 ACR in um

187
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:02,918
in Oregon um so kind of a vast array of

188
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:05,038
different uh settings that I got to

189
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:07,839
practice and and learn from all of these

190
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,318
different uh you know settings that's so

191
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,598
cool it sounds like you've gotten a lot

192
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,000
of experience over the past 15 years

193
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,399
doing all sorts of things and yeah I can

194
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,759
totally relate to what you mean by

195
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:18,439
confusing with all the different

196
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,120
acronyms I think that a lot of my

197
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:21,800
audience kind of falls in the Trap oh

198
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,000
what's this that and then they they get

199
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,439
so frustrated because they don't really

200
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,598
know and then they just don't do things

201
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,918
one of the things I noticed to that with

202
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:29,918
your YouTube channel you make things

203
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,079
real easy with the explanation and I'm

204
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,360
excited for this episode because we're

205
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,278
going to go through a lot of things that

206
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,959
I'm sure that my audience is confused on

207
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:39,399
and you'll be able to explain them in a

208
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:41,838
a beginner friendly manner that people

209
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:44,360
will be able to to understand so yeah

210
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,880
I'd love to get into that awesome cool

211
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,080
maybe let's start with your farm can you

212
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,360
kind of give us a rundown of what you've

213
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,920
been doing recently on your farm

214
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,879
absolutely um yeah so I kind of

215
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:59,240
explained the history of kind of going

216
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:01,439
up through the Pacific Northwest uh but

217
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,720
uh as fate would have it it kind of

218
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,720
landed me back in Southern California

219
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,680
where I'm originally from uh

220
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:12,639
specifically North County San

221
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:16,799
Diego uh I'm in a basically a Zone 9B

222
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:19,319
10A um so we're in a tropical kind of

223
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,759
subtropical we we get some freezes but

224
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,440
not a lot so we're able to grow a lot of

225
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:26,278
uh tropical fruit here which is

226
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,079
extremely exciting to me I've lived in

227
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:31,159
more temperate climates my whole life so

228
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:32,879
this was was a huge opportunity like 3

229
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:35,759
years ago moving down here I've just

230
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:39,320
kind of done a deep dive into more

231
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:41,919
tropical subtropical plants and fruits

232
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,920
and So currently um you know I've been

233
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,958
establishing some different food forests

234
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:49,479
which has really become my passion is

235
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:51,439
polyculture Food Forest uh and currently

236
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,278
this year I'm working on a really

237
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:59,959
exciting project it's 22 Acres uh in

238
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:03,799
North County San Diego so it's primarily

239
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:08,278
its history is an avocado Orchard uh I

240
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:10,599
would say probably roughly like eight 8

241
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:13,039
Acres of that is planted with avocados

242
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,360
there's quite a few different citrus

243
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:18,799
trees um it's also been used as a flower

244
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,560
market Garden so things like purple

245
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:24,278
Pride uh some of these high value

246
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:26,799
flowers from market so we're trying to

247
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:30,519
run with kind of what's already here but

248
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:33,759
we're also um prepping for Copic gagro

249
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:35,720
forestry planting on about half an acre

250
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,720
so we've been sourcing a lot of fruit

251
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:43,440
trees for that um plants that we can

252
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,278
grow here like mangoes even like um you

253
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,519
know longan we just picked up some

254
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,600
longans

255
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:52,879
yesterday uh papaya you know uh cherya

256
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,600
we have several cherya trees that are

257
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:57,679
well established on the property which

258
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,680
is a fruit I absolutely love so I've

259
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,958
just really fell in love with you know a

260
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:05,399
lot of these tropical fruits and and

261
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:07,199
it's just a vast kind of rabbit hole of

262
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,759
of uh fruit that I wasn't even

263
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,959
introduced to until a few years ago and

264
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,679
so that's my current project we're also

265
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:16,399
uh implementing more of a traditional

266
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:18,759
kind of Market Garden so we are

267
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,839
incorporating you know annuals in with

268
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:22,559
perennial systems and kind of

269
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,600
experimenting with both of those so

270
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:29,399
offering kind of a a wide array of you

271
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,639
know different um poly cultures that's

272
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,480
so cool that sounds like you got so much

273
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:36,480
going on there in your recent YouTube

274
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,440
video one thing I noticed that you're

275
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,079
doing is you've increased the organic

276
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,680
matter in your soil and you've also

277
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:42,799
added a cover crop those are kind of

278
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:44,838
like the first steps that you've been

279
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,838
doing can you talk to us about some

280
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:50,639
sustainable ways to increase the organic

281
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:53,360
matter in soil yeah well I mean what you

282
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:57,799
just mentioned is probably my favorite

283
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:01,120
way of adding organic matter um you know

284
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:02,359
a lot of what permaculture and Copic

285
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,480
Agro

286
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:08,759
forestry um the methodology there is

287
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:12,200
more looking for things that are

288
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:15,480
directly in your ecosystem so looking

289
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:18,759
for materials that we can use for

290
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,600
creating biomass composting um I like to

291
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:24,000
use a lot of cover crops as you

292
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,440
mentioned so you know Clover Alfalfa

293
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,600
between those two you have you know nit

294
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,399
nitrogen

295
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,240
fixation um you also have you know

296
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:38,360
phosphorus uh like Alfalfa has an

297
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,519
affinity um for phosphorus mobilizing so

298
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:44,320
between those two um you're really doing

299
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,278
a lot of improvement with the soil um

300
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,839
I'm a noil farmer but you know sometimes

301
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,799
we have to do a hard reset to you know

302
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,000
create a new planting or switch out a

303
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:56,240
crop or something so that's the only

304
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,519
time I will ever recommend really a till

305
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,320
because it's so damaging to the soil but

306
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:03,159
if it's it's already

307
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,278
compacted um you have erosion going on

308
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:07,879
you have you know a system like a

309
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,838
monoculture system you want to swap out

310
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:13,078
you know then the tilling really makes

311
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,399
sense so for me that first succession

312
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:17,919
because really with copics we we're

313
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:20,440
thinking about the successional planting

314
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,479
you know that Clover might just be there

315
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,639
for the beginning to help you know

316
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,920
create that biomask get the nitrogen

317
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,799
fixation really going in the soil get

318
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,719
the exudates really pump pumping down in

319
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:34,639
as photosynthesis is is pumping you know

320
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,360
pushing a lot of those sugars down into

321
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,959
the soil which is teamed with you know

322
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,399
knf and jadam when we're putting imos

323
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,919
and jadam microbial solution in the soil

324
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,320
and now we're really building up the

325
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,559
life in the soil along with that biomass

326
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,240
and getting that nutrient cycling really

327
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:55,000
pumping so I mean that's probably my

328
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,079
favorite way to build up the fertility

329
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,120
in the soil uh the

330
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:03,519
biomass um and organic matter is really

331
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,919
growing those cover crops and um we can

332
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:10,560
get more into you know support plants

333
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:12,278
and um you know companion planting um

334
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,239
but right off the bat I'd say get to

335
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:18,799
know the legume family um nitrogen

336
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:22,198
fixing family fabas uh I always say they

337
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:24,599
call it fabas because it's fabulous in

338
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:27,120
in the sense that these plants uh are

339
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,720
just amazing in a lot of them are fast

340
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,240
Growers vigorous Growers and and again

341
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,440
they're nitrogen fixers so taking that

342
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,198
atmospheric nitrogen you know the ryia

343
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,199
bacteria that is symbiotically growing

344
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:44,198
with a lot of these uh legumes is is

345
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:47,639
offering Us free nitrogen so we're we're

346
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:50,198
producing our own fertilizer in sichu on

347
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,198
site we don't have to go to uh our

348
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:54,639
neighbors or our grow store down the

349
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:57,198
street or you know so you can practice

350
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,879
organic farming in a very unsustainable

351
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,719
way you know what I mean when we get

352
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,720
into into regenerative and even copics

353
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,839
now we're looking at directly in our

354
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:10,560
close vicinity so trying to do things in

355
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:12,480
sichu on site from animals to um you

356
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,758
know plants that were growing for those

357
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,240
fertilizers makes sense it must be a big

358
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:18,680
cost savings going that route as well I

359
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,879
can only imagine the amount of money

360
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:23,359
you're saving from doing it the all

361
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,039
natural way versus going on buying

362
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,000
synthetic nutrients for example which a

363
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,240
lot of farms are still du to this day

364
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,879
where they're buying chemical

365
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,600
fertilizers they're adding it onto the

366
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:34,039
land and they're killing off their

367
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,399
microbial population and they're just

368
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:37,198
you know they're kind of in a rut to

369
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,879
where they're they're relying on these

370
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:40,399
chemical fertilizers in order to grow

371
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,559
the crops year after year when really

372
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,559
they can go the alternative route which

373
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:47,599
is the allnatural route and use

374
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:50,399
resources from your land that's free and

375
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,959
then grow plants with that so exactly

376
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,720
yeah now one of the things that you I

377
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,278
saw in your video is that you added down

378
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,399
compost and I think a lot of viewers are

379
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,958
using compost there different types of

380
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:05,399
compost out there I'd like to know what

381
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:08,359
type of compost do you recommend and why

382
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:12,799
yeah so you know along with what I was

383
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:15,480
saying was I like to do things in sichu

384
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:19,159
and really create my own amendments my

385
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:21,720
own um inputs my own fertilizers my own

386
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:24,480
compost um but it really depends on the

387
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,560
scale and the timing I mean you know the

388
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,759
context kind of drives everything so

389
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:32,638
there really isn't uh

390
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:36,560
uh kind of cookie cutter method that I

391
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:39,600
use it's really all context driven um so

392
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:41,359
for this context you know we we didn't

393
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,480
have much organic matter in the soil

394
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,959
here at the farm that I'm currently at

395
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:50,039
so we had a lot of decomposed Granite

396
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:53,919
sand um so we made the call to Source

397
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:57,399
some omry organic certified compost till

398
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:59,479
that into the soil I mean really it's

399
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,759
about a 5year headstone start if you

400
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,959
think about like being able to grow

401
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,360
biomass chop and drop it get it all to

402
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:09,519
break down we're really giving ourselves

403
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:12,479
about 5 years by tilling in you know

404
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:14,000
good quality compost into the soil from

405
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,759
where we would be if we're just trying

406
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,160
to build that up you know say with uh

407
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:24,919
top dressing and and again you know

408
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:26,959
using mulches and cover crops so um so

409
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:30,038
yeah that's what we decided to do here

410
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,240
um we did um didn't produce all this

411
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:34,119
compost and make it myself to begin with

412
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,200
uh we brought it in from from a local

413
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:40,119
company uh it was Cal RoR and um you

414
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,080
know got a test on that because one

415
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:44,239
thing I'd say about compost is we really

416
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:46,599
need to trust the source because

417
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,960
whatever those animals are eating you

418
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:52,480
know is ultimately going to end up in

419
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,400
your finished compost and a lot of these

420
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,120
herbicides uh you know and different

421
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,840
chemicals can make it through the

422
00:17:56,119 --> 00:18:03,000
digestive tract of of cows of cattle of

423
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:05,000
livestock and uh we want to make sure

424
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,798
that doesn't get into our our compost

425
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,839
either it's certainly true when they say

426
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:12,279
not all compost is created equal

427
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:15,439
100% well I mean I I did take elain

428
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:18,079
Ingram's uh course and and she has a

429
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,320
very specific method biocomplete compost

430
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:23,558
so you know I mean because as you said

431
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:26,119
not all composts is created equal I go

432
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:28,200
to some of the uh you know landscape

433
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:31,199
supplies around here and what they're

434
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:35,159
selling is compost is essentially like

435
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,200
you know wood chips and like sand and

436
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:40,720
I'm like where's the organic matter in

437
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:44,120
this this isn't compost so yeah that's

438
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,400
that's kind of a that that term I would

439
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:48,038
use that you know with a lot of caution

440
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,880
and take it with a grain of salt you

441
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:52,640
know grain of sand literally so what can

442
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,520
viewers look for when they're going out

443
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,240
to purchase compost some compost does

444
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:58,240
come in a bag some are just kind of out

445
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,038
in the lot is there something a

446
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,319
particular should be looking for in the

447
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,279
compost and also do you recommend

448
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:06,759
testing of the compost before purchase

449
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,558
so if you can get like a small sample

450
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,519
test it make sure everything is good and

451
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:11,879
then go ahead and do a large purchase

452
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:13,119
yeah well I mean I would always

453
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,880
recommend

454
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:18,079
organic um you know I was at the grow

455
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,360
store yesterday we were sourcing some uh

456
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:23,199
fruit trees for the Orchard and um I was

457
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,519
looking at

458
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,919
um a

459
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:30,519
biodynamic uh compost so I mean you know

460
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,759
that those are things I would look for

461
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:34,759
you know obviously

462
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:37,640
organic um

463
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:41,279
and yeah the testing is really important

464
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,759
so usually if you're um interested in

465
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,558
getting a test result you can typically

466
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,599
you know email or get a hold of somebody

467
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:51,279
in the company to get a test result now

468
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:54,519
sometimes the problem with that is that

469
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:56,798
they are you know only required to test

470
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:58,798
so often so you know the batch of

471
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:01,679
compost that you got might not be the

472
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:05,119
same test result as a previous batch

473
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,679
that was made so they kind of um that

474
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:12,199
can get tricky but but the uh company

475
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:15,720
that we use uh I talk directly to they

476
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:19,000
have a a PhD you know agronomist that

477
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,600
works for their company and um you know

478
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,200
he was able to I was able to talk to him

479
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:26,199
directly on the phone and he offered a

480
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,279
really cool guy offered me the test

481
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:32,159
results and you know showed you know

482
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,440
uh negligent really uh amounts of any

483
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,880
kind of you know harmful uh glyphosate

484
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,400
or or anything else so yeah I would

485
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,080
highly recommend you know trying to get

486
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,960
a test uh if you can talk to the highest

487
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,359
uh quality control person in that

488
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,000
company you can just to kind of Ensure

489
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:52,119
and and get to know like what you know

490
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,480
get to know what our our our Foods food

491
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:57,279
was eating or like our plant's food what

492
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:02,519
its food was eating you know what I mean

493
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:04,720
get to know that um kind of um down the

494
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:07,319
line where those sources are coming from

495
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,400
really important that's some good advice

496
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:11,359
now you mentioned the word biodynamic

497
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,640
and I have quite a few folks that are

498
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:14,319
beginners here that's probably the first

499
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,159
time they're even hearing of that word

500
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,200
can you break it down for us what is

501
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,159
that yeah that's that's a whole Rabbit

502
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,159
Hole in and of itself uh I don't claim

503
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,600
to be an expert but I have studied a

504
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,000
little bit into it uh biodynamics was

505
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:30,000
created by a gentleman named Rudolph

506
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,599
Steiner and he's a really interesting

507
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,759
character in history um he wasn't a

508
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:39,399
farmer per se he was more um kind of the

509
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:43,200
way I describe him is a a very

510
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:46,440
esoteric kind of uh guy that used

511
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,759
astrology that used uh it it's it's

512
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:53,120
really it it's it its core I would say

513
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:55,919
it's Alchemy applied to Agriculture and

514
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:58,158
so you know this was in the early 1900s

515
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,960
and and you know people came to Rudolph

516
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:04,120
Steiner because he was just such a a

517
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:08,200
powerful figure in his community on all

518
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:10,798
topics they asked him for a specific way

519
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,440
of of farming and so he came up with

520
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:15,960
biodynamics as an alternative to

521
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,000
Conventional farming uh and so

522
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,038
biodynamics the short answer is that was

523
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,599
what he came up with it it encompasses

524
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:25,679
astrological

525
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:27,480
alignments um you know and there's a

526
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,080
series of different inputs some of them

527
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:33,720
actually some somei similar to Korean

528
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,439
natural farming I mean for example one

529
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:39,079
uh

530
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:41,000
bd500 is horn manure and so um what you

531
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:44,000
do is you take manure you would put that

532
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,159
in a horn uh traditionally and put that

533
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,759
underground for the winter and so to me

534
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,880
what that is is it's a you know

535
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:53,519
microbial inoculant by the time you dig

536
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,799
that up after a season after a winter

537
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:58,278
you now have it completely inoculated

538
00:22:55,798 --> 00:22:59,839
with the soil microbiome of that land

539
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:02,000
and and then you take that and you go

540
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:04,519
around and spray that and kind of spread

541
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,919
it but it it it works in

542
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:09,519
homeopathic uh ways um some of them are

543
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,320
kind of hard to explain by

544
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,839
reductionistic science so it kind of

545
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:15,798
gets more into some esoteric Realms

546
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:17,480
that's wild I had never heard of that I

547
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:19,558
didn't even know that was a thing that's

548
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,480
so cool to hear now one other thing that

549
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:24,678
I noticed that you do is leaf mold

550
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,000
utilize leaf mold can you talk to us

551
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:29,038
what is leaf mold what are the benefits

552
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,960
how do you create it how do you apply it

553
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:36,599
so on and so forth yeah so leaf mold um

554
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,640
is really uh a passionate topic um it's

555
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:42,038
really my go-to to really create the

556
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,559
foundation of fertility and soil and so

557
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:49,200
it's it's really the decomposition of

558
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:53,240
leaves from deciduous trees and so um

559
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,798
primarily the fungi that is symbiotic um

560
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,278
sometimes not always symbiotic I mean

561
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:59,720
there's a whole Consortium of different

562
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:02,798
fungus and bacteria I but specifically

563
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,880
it's more the fungi that creates this

564
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:08,798
aggregate through a slow you could call

565
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,799
it um you know you could call it a

566
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:14,480
composting process um because the the

567
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:17,240
leaves are decomposing Slowly by the

568
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,360
fungi that's really eating the lious

569
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,960
material and creating this beautiful

570
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:27,000
soil aggregate uh meaning like big

571
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:30,880
clumps of uh this these leaves that are

572
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,919
being literally Digest Ed by the fungi

573
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,360
um and you just see these big webs big

574
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:41,240
chunk of white

575
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:44,119
melal um humus in the top soil and you

576
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:47,519
know so this is used in Korean natural

577
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:51,000
farming and jadam as a primary means of

578
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:53,398
uh an inoculant for U growing you know

579
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,558
IMO cultures for creating jadal

580
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:57,319
microbial

581
00:24:54,558 --> 00:25:00,398
solution um and so the important thing

582
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:02,720
to note is that it's a Consortium we're

583
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:05,278
not looking for a specific type of

584
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,000
fungus or whatever and um you know

585
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:08,960
whenever I've talked to kind of mushroom

586
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,240
Growers about IMO they're always like

587
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:15,038
Curious so what mushroom are you going

588
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:17,359
for and it doesn't necessarily work that

589
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:20,480
way we want the Consortium we are

590
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:23,278
mimicking nature and so we want that

591
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,880
diversity uh I think you had Chris Trump

592
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:27,720
on the podcast and um he was talking

593
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,120
about those DNA tests that were done

594
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:34,240
over 400 100 different species of fungi

595
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:36,759
over 800 you know bacteria found in some

596
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,399
of this you know this was uh IMO

597
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:40,798
cultures cultured from leaf mold but

598
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:43,000
that's what we're looking for is really

599
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:46,720
the diversity there's power and

600
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:51,159
diversity and a big approach for me in

601
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:54,000
in how I practice agriculture is kind of

602
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:56,679
trying to create these diverse systems

603
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,798
these self-regulating systems by

604
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:01,080
bringing in the healthy

605
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,319
cultures the diversity and kind of

606
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:05,839
letting nature figure that out for

607
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:08,359
itself um obviously like I've trained in

608
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:10,278
some uh microscopy too so I can look

609
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:12,678
down under a microscope and kind of look

610
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:15,000
for the players involved but you know

611
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:16,919
you don't have to be a scientist uh or

612
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
even use know how to use a microscope to

613
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:23,038
be really successful at culturing imos

614
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,240
and and using them very effectively uh

615
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:27,359
in your Gardens and on your farm that's

616
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,839
one thing about culturing on your own is

617
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:32,119
the diversity is going

618
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:33,839
far superior far more than if you're

619
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:35,398
buying some of these microbial inoculum

620
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,359
products on the market I'm not making a

621
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:38,798
claim they should never use never do

622
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,798
that and that they don't work or

623
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,000
anything like that but you're going to

624
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:44,278
get much more diversity going this

625
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,278
allnatural farming route and kind of

626
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:48,720
culturing your own absolutely 100% you

627
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:51,278
know and I'm not I'm not going to knock

628
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,159
some of these uh commercial inoculant

629
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:54,519
like I use some of them back in the day

630
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:57,679
and you know specifically to your

631
00:26:54,519 --> 00:27:00,639
audience that you know grows indoors um

632
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:03,480
I did grow grow uh an indoor back in the

633
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,720
day where I was using imos from outside

634
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,679
bringing those in but that's a careful

635
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,839
process um you know if you're doing a

636
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:13,240
big scale commercial operation um

637
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,038
obviously you got to be careful when

638
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,640
you're doing that to really build up the

639
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:19,798
right diversity so I think that you know

640
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,320
indoors might make a little more sense

641
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:24,278
for some of these different uh microbial

642
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:27,158
inoculant that you can buy kind of bugs

643
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:30,359
in a jug so to speak they certainly like

644
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:33,360
have some efficacy but um you know I I

645
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:36,359
would use IMO over over those all day

646
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,240
long and and here's one big uh

647
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:41,798
difference between some of these bugs in

648
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,558
a jug versus like imos imos are cultured

649
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:46,440
out in nature versus cultured in a

650
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:49,599
laboratory and there's a big difference

651
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,558
between microbes that are cultured in a

652
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,599
community where there's you know

653
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,519
competition and there's so much

654
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:58,359
diversity that all these players are

655
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,240
getting involved I mean only the

656
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:03,199
literally survive whereas in a in a lab

657
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,399
where you're creating like a monoculture

658
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,759
in a sterile environment those cultures

659
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:12,439
don't have the competition they don't

660
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:15,519
have um that diversity in nature um

661
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,440
which is really kind of what drives um

662
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:20,159
the power and and strength of a lot of

663
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,640
these microorganisms in in in my opinion

664
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,320
so I'm not going to say that these these

665
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,038
store bought inoculant don't have a

666
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,639
place but uh you know for me like I

667
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,558
don't I don't buy anything

668
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:35,038
um except for like a culture that I'm

669
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:38,398
buying to reculture for example I take

670
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:40,519
um El rudai uh it's a strain of

671
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:44,558
lactobacillus uh it was originally found

672
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:46,798
in uh Mother's breast milk and uh so

673
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:50,798
it's a probiotic and it it's um there's

674
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:54,960
a lot of new studies on you know uh

675
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:57,558
lactobacillus rud ey and so I buy the

676
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,880
culture for that to take as a probiotic

677
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:02,798
and I reculture that as a yogurt to take

678
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:06,200
for myself so you know and you can do

679
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:08,519
the same with these you know uh these

680
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,679
microbes for applying to you know plants

681
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:11,798
and agriculture that's awesome so it

682
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,320
sounds like there's multiple ways to

683
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:16,278
kind of get to the Finish Line oh 100%

684
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,879
yeah but for me it all really starts

685
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:20,278
with the leaf mold I mean there's a lot

686
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,039
of lactobacillus like everywhere on our

687
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:26,079
skin in the air we can culture that as

688
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:28,798
well which you know Labs is is a great

689
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:31,158
uh companion in uh really great for

690
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,720
decomposing organic matter in the soil

691
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:37,399
too but uh you also get a lot of that in

692
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,839
your your IMO cultures so yeah I'm sure

693
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:41,639
there's got to be some risks and

694
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:44,119
mistakes that can happen when you're

695
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,720
creating your own IMO can you get into

696
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:51,879
that yeah I mean it's definitely uh you

697
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:54,798
know a specific process for sure and um

698
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,559
I after about 10 years of making IMO

699
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,879
piles my process has kind of changed a

700
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:02,879
little bit

701
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,399
um and I can speak to that however um

702
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,799
what I would say to your original

703
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:10,119
question is um I would say uh the

704
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:12,440
temperatures that you hold you know your

705
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:14,678
IMO pile when you're culturing is really

706
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:19,159
important you don't want to be you know

707
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:22,360
culturing higher than about 130° fahit

708
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:25,080
and that window between 120 and 130 is

709
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:27,599
is pretty optimal to maintain that uh

710
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:31,278
during the process which means you'll be

711
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:33,639
turning the pile quite a bit um on the

712
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:36,839
on the flip side of that you don't want

713
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,320
to um disturb the pile too much like

714
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:40,678
there is a balance like you don't want

715
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:42,678
to come in and just turn your pile to

716
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,120
where it works a lot like a fire when

717
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:46,440
you're starting a fire like you don't

718
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:50,038
want to extinguish that fire too fast

719
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,759
like you really want the the microbes to

720
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:56,158
start eating that food supply which is

721
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:59,158
you know basically Millrun so oats

722
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:01,760
barley Wheats any of those will work you

723
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:03,519
Mill that down the carbohydrates fats

724
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:07,720
proteins available are going to become a

725
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:10,679
food source um and so yeah I mean I I

726
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,880
would say that um having that optimal

727
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:13,720
temperature that goldilock zone is

728
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,399
really

729
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:20,200
important and um you know making sure it

730
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:23,239
doesn't get too wet too Anor robic if

731
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,639
you got you know uh ammonia smells

732
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,159
coming off of your pile that's a red

733
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:30,918
flag so yeah there there is kind kind of

734
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,320
a a goldilock Zone kind of sweet spot

735
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:34,399
that you want to stay between when

736
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:36,158
culturing your your imos that's good

737
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,518
advice I appreciate you uh bring that

738
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,799
down for us so folks are aware you

739
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:43,240
mentioned you've been creating IMO for

740
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:45,398
10 years and you've kind of adjusted the

741
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,000
way you've been doing over the years

742
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:49,439
would you be willing to kind of break

743
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,880
down what steps you currently do to

744
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,840
create IMO yeah absolutely so um I'll

745
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,399
just tell this this quick story because

746
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:01,158
this is how I came to the Cur process of

747
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:03,918
of how my process has changed a little

748
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:07,039
bit um I was uh blessed with the

749
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,720
opportunity to uh you know train

750
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:12,000
directly with the Cho family uh Master

751
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,919
hanq Cho who recently passed away rest

752
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,558
in peace Master

753
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:22,720
Hano uh also his son uh young s Cho and

754
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:25,678
their family uh jadam Sona and um

755
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,000
basically uh was part of a group that

756
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,278
helped to promote a tour around the

757
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,278
whole United States with the The Cho

758
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:38,240
family and so I toured with the Cho

759
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:42,440
family and um you know so we had a an

760
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,759
Airbnb out in uh DC to do an event at

761
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:48,120
Firebird Farms out there an amazing

762
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:51,119
farm and uh we had a workshop out there

763
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:53,918
and so one night I was hanging out with

764
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:56,199
um cultivating Classics who makes these

765
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:59,759
awesome shirts check them out makes gear

766
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:02,278
IMO gear and and um so he was helping

767
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:07,839
with the tour and we were sitting with

768
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:11,440
uh choyang song and um all having a

769
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:13,398
beverage of choice and basically um he

770
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,720
told me the story of kind of how IMO

771
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:19,359
came to be so Master chose original way

772
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:23,000
for culturing you know IMO and that was

773
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:25,879
going through the process of imo1 two

774
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,599
you know into three and four and so one

775
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,360
for listeners that don't know I think

776
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:33,398
it's been explained on here uh maybe by

777
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:36,079
previous guests but you basically use a

778
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:38,638
cold like you cook rice and you go out

779
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:40,720
and you place it in you know healthy

780
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:44,000
forests with microbiomes or those

781
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,399
healthy ecosystems near you and you

782
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,319
would culture the the

783
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:52,119
fungi in that environment the indigenous

784
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:55,038
microorganisms bring that back mix it

785
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:58,439
one to one with a brown sugar then you

786
00:33:55,038 --> 00:34:00,480
would have imo2 in a jar now imo2 is

787
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,519
really cool because this is like you

788
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,399
know a cryogenic freeze of that specific

789
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,519
year that time of year which that

790
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:11,279
fluctuates throughout the year so you

791
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:13,480
literally have a library of that

792
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,679
microbiology from that very moment and

793
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,639
you can keep a whole library of these Im

794
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,240
o2s so that is one really cool thing

795
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,760
about imo2 from there you can take the

796
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:26,439
IMO Collections and best practice is

797
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,240
really to take several of those to grow

798
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:33,000
on a substrate you you know Millrun

799
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:35,199
reculture that that gives you imo3 and

800
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,079
then you would add native soil reculture

801
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:41,078
it again to make im4 you can take that a

802
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,480
step further into IMO 5 by adding I like

803
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:47,839
to do seaweed so a nitrogen Source you

804
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:50,599
could use um manures for this but I5 is

805
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:52,519
basically if you get to that uh stage

806
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:55,760
which which is a long process to get

807
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:57,759
there um that is your like super

808
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,440
Amendment you literally don't really

809
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:04,200
have to add much more than IM5 if you

810
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:06,920
get there okay so that being said

811
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:09,799
simplifying the process what Yong sang

812
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:13,920
Cho told me was that his father

813
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:17,519
originally y sang CH or um Cho um hucho

814
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:21,079
excuse me he originally uh would take

815
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:23,320
leaf mold and directly culture that on a

816
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:24,680
substrate and make you know what we

817
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,838
consider

818
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:31,078
imo3 um and then what happened is there

819
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:34,199
putting together some books and it was

820
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:37,800
kind of uh uh Master Cho's daughter was

821
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:40,279
helping with the recipe writing and you

822
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,680
know there was there was a decision made

823
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:46,880
at some point to basically use the extra

824
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:49,118
steps of imo1 collecting in a rice box

825
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:53,119
adding it to sugar and then creating

826
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:55,318
imo3 which which adds a lot of steps so

827
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:58,039
you can do those extra steps if you like

828
00:35:55,318 --> 00:36:02,559
but I kind of just used the leaf mold

829
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:04,838
straight to the substrate now um I think

830
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,838
this is also a lot more uh kind of

831
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:09,078
approachable for people the more

832
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:12,039
accessible and approachable and kind of

833
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:15,280
less steps involved I find um people

834
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:18,559
naturally stick with it a little more uh

835
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:21,599
so uh the other thing that I do is

836
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:24,078
instead of I love to Mill down all of my

837
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,160
grains myself rather than just buying a

838
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:30,079
mill run from a Feed Supply because we

839
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:32,480
can really we have more control of the

840
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,480
the food sources uh the degree in which

841
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,400
we're uh Milling that grain down to make

842
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:41,519
available those carbohydrates uh the

843
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,559
fats and everything that that grain has

844
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:47,199
inside all the constituents that these

845
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:49,960
microbes can feed on so um what I do is

846
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:51,759
I'll Mill my own grains um which kind of

847
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,159
came from a practice I used to brew a

848
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,040
lot of beer back in the day and so that

849
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:58,480
was kind of I had these Mills around and

850
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:02,279
started using it for that um but what I

851
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,719
started doing was um using some whole

852
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,400
grain in my pile so not Milling all of

853
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:08,598
that but actually leaving some of the

854
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,720
whole grain in there and then I noticed

855
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:12,838
that grain would germinate and Sprout so

856
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:15,039
I'd have these Sprouts within my pile

857
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:18,000
and then I thought wow this is something

858
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:19,719
because now I can actually you know a

859
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,039
lot of people might be familiar with

860
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:25,078
like um you know sprouted teas for you

861
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:27,960
know those enzymes and hormones that you

862
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:29,760
get from from doing these sprouted teas

863
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,000
and so that's kind of where my thinking

864
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,599
started going with this was well if we

865
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,599
have some of those Sprouts growing in

866
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,359
the mix too you know now we're

867
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:41,160
increasing like the enzymes and you know

868
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:43,639
everything else

869
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:45,838
um that comes along with you know

870
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:48,199
germination and so we're in you know

871
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:51,358
adding that to this pile too and now we

872
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:54,799
really have a super powerful inoculant

873
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:58,960
either go broadcast or to take further

874
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:01,280
into uh a liquid Imo um like Chris Trump

875
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,119
kind of originally did I know there's

876
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,280
tons of folks here that are listening in

877
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,358
that uh that do the process and hearing

878
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,640
somebody who's done it for 10 years how

879
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:12,358
they do it is certainly valuable so

880
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,400
thanks for breaking that down for us

881
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:16,159
you're welcome I also explain that a lot

882
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,240
more detail kind of on my YouTube

883
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,118
channel if anybody wants to watch any of

884
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:21,959
those videos sweet yeah I'll definitely

885
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:23,838
have a link to Preston's YouTube channel

886
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,318
down in the description section below so

887
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:29,960
people can easily get to it now another

888
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:33,079
potential option that can do is jadam

889
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:35,480
microbial solution JMS can you break

890
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:37,760
that down for us what is it exactly and

891
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,679
kind of how does it differ from IMO

892
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:46,440
that's a good question um

893
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:49,799
so JMS is sort of a a simplified version

894
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:52,679
for replacing IMO that young sing of

895
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,280
jadam came up with uh he felt like

896
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:57,679
there's too many kind of steps involved

897
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,560
I think if we take those couple steps

898
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:03,559
out it makes it a lot more approachable

899
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:07,799
um but you know you can you can culture

900
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:12,279
JMS incredibly quick so basically with

901
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:16,480
potatoes uh and sea salt right and so um

902
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:18,599
it's nearly free to brew and you still

903
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,880
use leaf mold only you're doing it in a

904
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:26,800
culture of water so it's it's um not air

905
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,240
rated uh so for the most part you know

906
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,480
anerobic

907
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:34,399
however not completely Anor robic um it

908
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:36,599
is recommended to really Splash when

909
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,280
you're when you're um cooking the

910
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:41,240
potatoes down you essentially make like

911
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,720
mashed potatoes and

912
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:46,879
then you know you can blend that up and

913
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:48,679
so it's very available starches uh and

914
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,280
then along with the trace mineral

915
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:54,039
complex that you get from sea salt now

916
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,920
you have this incredible food source for

917
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:57,519
these

918
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,559
microorganisms and as you steep that in

919
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:00,599
a

920
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,199
bucket you know you really want to get

921
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:05,119
it agitated so you're splashing a lot of

922
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:08,159
oxygen into the mix so even though it's

923
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:11,079
not completely like an aerated compost

924
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:13,279
tea with a bubbler rolling um it's not a

925
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:15,480
Vortex or anything like that you still

926
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,839
it's not a lot of people think that

927
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,400
might be just completely Anor robic and

928
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:21,960
that's not the case we still get some

929
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,880
aerobic culture in there um I would say

930
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,599
it's a little more Anor robic so we

931
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,519
might be getting more uh facultative

932
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:33,880
culture than than uh say what you'd get

933
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:35,719
with the the imos so I have seen that um

934
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,519
so there is a little bit of a difference

935
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:40,519
and and so to kind of explain the

936
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:42,358
difference in how I would use IMO a

937
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:43,599
little bit differently than JMS even

938
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:46,480
though they're pretty much

939
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:50,440
interchangeable when I'm first uh

940
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:54,358
establishing um a new grow say I have

941
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:57,440
like really uh you know compacted soil

942
00:40:54,358 --> 00:41:00,199
and maybe got some erosion going on JMS

943
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,920
is amazing for that soaking in jmss CU

944
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:05,559
you really want to soak that in like

945
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:08,760
deep down young sing always says J jaw

946
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:11,239
which means like deep down and uh into

947
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,599
the soil and they can survive in

948
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:15,679
conditions without oxygen so that's

949
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:21,480
really good at like breaking up hard

950
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:23,719
compacted clay you know rock um sand and

951
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,880
so I would start with the

952
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:29,799
JMS first for that situation then I

953
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,400
would come come back start mulching more

954
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:35,039
and then um before getting ready for a

955
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,599
planting I would be adding the imos

956
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:40,039
directly you like before my plantings

957
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,480
during my plantings and after and that's

958
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:44,480
kind of dealing more with the aerobic

959
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,519
cultures that are in the top you know 4

960
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,920
Ines of the top soil so that's kind of

961
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:51,719
how I differentiate those sounds like

962
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:54,159
it's a lot easier to do JMS and would be

963
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:56,239
to do the IMO process I mean with you

964
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:57,480
mentioned potatoes and sea salt that's

965
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,358
something that lot of people just have

966
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,760
in their cupboard there so they can

967
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:03,199
easily kind of get started creating

968
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,359
their own JMS solution is there a

969
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:07,679
specific type of potato that's better

970
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:09,679
than other like rusted potatoes versus

971
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:13,358
sweet potato is there any differences at

972
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:15,679
all there um it's an interesting

973
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:18,799
question it's really like what has the

974
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:20,799
most starches cuz that's really you know

975
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,960
what the food source is that we're

976
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,440
getting from potatoes this gets into

977
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,440
kind of a really interesting area of

978
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,079
optimizing your JMS and so let's say

979
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,639
you're growing strawberries uh you could

980
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:37,119
create a JMS by putting potatoes or

981
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:40,118
strictly strawberries into that and now

982
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:43,079
you're optimizing your microorganisms

983
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:45,720
for that specific crop so this gets into

984
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:49,200
a a really interesting kind of uh area

985
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:52,679
of of application and research um you

986
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:55,318
know tailoring these microorganisms for

987
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:56,879
the specific crop so I haven't seen a

988
00:42:55,318 --> 00:43:00,480
huge difference I have used like sweet

989
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:03,079
po potatoes before um I would say by

990
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,000
adding different food sources you are

991
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:06,039
you know

992
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,079
potentially and I've seen this under a

993
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:10,679
microscope you are culturing you know

994
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:13,720
different strains um largely they're

995
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:16,558
going to be similar based on you know uh

996
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:21,159
samples that were taken from the same

997
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:23,720
environment um but this also gets to um

998
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:26,639
jadam and I guess you could say knf as

999
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:28,519
well typically you want to be culturing

1000
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:31,239
in the same exact environment that

1001
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:33,519
you're growing in because those

1002
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:35,879
microorganisms are optimized for those

1003
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:38,719
conditions there's a reason why when I

1004
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,599
go collect leaf mold under an oak tree

1005
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:42,358
that's a 50-year-old oak oak tree on

1006
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:44,599
this property there's a reason why

1007
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:46,759
they're there because they went through

1008
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:49,599
the whole process of you know Evolution

1009
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:52,240
and adapting in in you know all of those

1010
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:55,240
different variables from the temperature

1011
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:58,078
humidity um the moisture you

1012
00:43:55,239 --> 00:44:01,078
know all those different VAR Ables these

1013
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,359
microbes made it through and have

1014
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:06,160
adapted and acclimated for literally

1015
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:08,598
thousands of years so they're optimized

1016
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:10,558
for that environment and so that is

1017
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:13,318
where you want to be doing your liquid

1018
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:15,960
fertilizers your composting your

1019
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:17,519
JMS um you want to put those barrels

1020
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,880
right next to the fields you're growing

1021
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:22,639
in that makes total sense now in regards

1022
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:24,440
to application rate probably majority of

1023
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:28,000
the folks out of tuning in are indoor

1024
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:30,200
Growers and uh JMS what would you say is

1025
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,039
an appropriate application rate when

1026
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:33,519
should they apply should it be you know

1027
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:35,558
every week should it be every other week

1028
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:36,880
once a month once a grow can you give us

1029
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:41,040
some information in regards to that

1030
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,880
stuff sure yeah I mean it's um you know

1031
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:44,639
it's variable for sure it kind of

1032
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,640
depends on your situation if we're

1033
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:51,279
talking about an indoor uh it might be a

1034
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:53,679
really good time to condition uh before

1035
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,319
let's say you're um you know prepping

1036
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:59,000
for a new planting and you just added a

1037
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:01,400
new soil mix a new blend you're getting

1038
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,440
the structure and your your soil uh a

1039
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:07,119
living soil system you know going jmss

1040
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,679
is great for that initial inoculation

1041
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,920
and kind of jump starting that whole

1042
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:12,039
process it's going to help start

1043
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,240
breaking down all the compost and

1044
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:16,719
organic matter in the soil um so that

1045
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:18,439
would be a good time to apply it when

1046
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,719
you're just getting started and just

1047
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:23,838
starting to build you know that soil

1048
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:27,000
food web um I would use it more often so

1049
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:29,920
maybe once a week you know for the first

1050
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,838
couple of months uh from that point on

1051
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:36,599
you know you might do it every uh month

1052
00:45:32,838 --> 00:45:39,119
or so and then once you really get it um

1053
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:41,318
those cultures really

1054
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,640
established um you don't have to apply

1055
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:47,039
that often I'd say maybe you know every

1056
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:49,078
succession of your planting I might do

1057
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:52,558
another application at that point maybe

1058
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:54,240
just one um but uh yeah so more up front

1059
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:56,200
when you're first developing the soil

1060
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:59,598
food web oh and so you're point about

1061
00:45:56,199 --> 00:46:04,039
you know application rates um 1 to 30 is

1062
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:07,960
a common rate I mean so a lot of these

1063
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:09,639
um you know kind of um applications work

1064
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,240
a little differently than say like a

1065
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:14,558
salt-based fertilizer where we get

1066
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:16,159
really specific on the application dose

1067
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:18,680
I mean we can stay within the

1068
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:21,639
recommended ranges um which is always

1069
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:23,558
good but it's it's not like you don't

1070
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:26,480
have to get too worried about like okay

1071
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:30,480
I did this one at like you know 50 Parts

1072
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:33,199
as opposed to to 30 parts um you might

1073
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,039
go with a more uh concentrated you know

1074
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:37,399
form of the JMS when you're first

1075
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:40,599
establishing it for example we had a

1076
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:43,119
really compacted area outside here um

1077
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:45,760
where we're doing the cop Copic rows on

1078
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:48,920
half an acre

1079
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,920
and um what I did is I just soaked it in

1080
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,519
with water and then I applied jmss

1081
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:57,079
straight onto the field but I did soak

1082
00:46:53,519 --> 00:47:01,280
it down first with water um but the the

1083
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:04,318
common rate is one part JMS to 30 parts

1084
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,720
decoronated filtered water that would be

1085
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:08,159
a pretty common

1086
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:11,759
application um you could go all the way

1087
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:14,519
to like 1 to 100 um and if you're

1088
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,720
soaking in first you could be applying

1089
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:19,039
JMS straight I'd be a little more

1090
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:21,679
careful doing that because it's it's uh

1091
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:24,159
it's pretty loaded with uh a lot of

1092
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:26,558
microbiology okay and then only as a

1093
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:30,960
soil drench or do people use it as a

1094
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:35,280
fold spray as well jmss more so as a a

1095
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:39,838
soil drench um you yeah you could fuler

1096
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:41,680
spray it but I feel uh a lot of those um

1097
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:43,838
kind of facultative Anor robes I mean

1098
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:46,639
they could they'll live in the phosphere

1099
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:48,920
as well as the the risos sphere so yeah

1100
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:51,679
you're going to get um you know some

1101
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:54,760
benefits from foler spraying as well if

1102
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:57,799
you have uh say you have some powdery

1103
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:01,119
mildew um you know JMS could be good for

1104
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:04,359
combating that um just like you know IMO

1105
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:06,720
limo tea is also good for that awesome

1106
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:08,960
all right what other simple inputs can

1107
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:11,239
indoor Growers make at home using either

1108
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,960
kitchen straps or easily sourced

1109
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:19,358
materials I would say fermented plant

1110
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,960
juices um which we use sugar to

1111
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:25,000
osmotically extract all the constituents

1112
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:27,079
out of plants usually just the uh growth

1113
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,239
tips that have most of the growth

1114
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:32,440
hormones in the plant um you know the

1115
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:34,358
oxin gibberelic acid is what we're going

1116
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:37,679
for as well as some of the

1117
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:41,159
constituents um you know in that plant

1118
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:43,078
so um basically harvesting vigorous

1119
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:45,279
weeds that grow around your house you

1120
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:47,680
can utilize those or your farm you can

1121
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:52,119
utilize those for a fertilizer to make

1122
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:54,679
uh a fpj fermented plant juice or if you

1123
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:57,519
go the jadam method you just throw it in

1124
00:48:54,679 --> 00:48:59,480
water and so I kind of around like

1125
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:02,400
everything in jadam you just like throw

1126
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:03,838
it in water and purify it um you know

1127
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,920
obviously there's more to the system

1128
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:08,880
than that um you know and as mentioned I

1129
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:12,159
think by previous guests you know the

1130
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:15,318
the IMO cultures are 80% of knf and

1131
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:18,838
jadam these other inputs that we make

1132
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:21,798
are kind of just additives little extras

1133
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:24,599
they also mimic like exudates with the

1134
00:49:21,798 --> 00:49:26,960
the soil content I think that's a lot of

1135
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:31,280
what um fpj

1136
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:33,720
is doing uh so yeah other inputs we

1137
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,280
could make um if you have eggshells you

1138
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:40,078
can make water soluble calcium if you

1139
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:44,119
have bones you can make Cal fos uh those

1140
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:47,280
are made with extractions of of vinegar

1141
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:50,318
um so you know those are are really

1142
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:53,160
great to make as well uh what else do we

1143
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:56,239
have um brown rice vinegar is another

1144
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:57,920
input in Korean natural farming uh I do

1145
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:00,919
culture some of my own brown rice

1146
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:03,760
vinegar um that gets a little involved

1147
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:06,200
that's a three-step fermentation process

1148
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:10,240
so um that's a little bit more involved

1149
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:13,480
in you know um Master Cho doesn't really

1150
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:16,959
teach never really taught brv for the

1151
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:19,119
most part that that I'm aware of so uh

1152
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,559
kind of found those recipes on my own

1153
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:23,000
but uh yeah those would be some good

1154
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:25,839
ones you can you can make I also do a

1155
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,039
lot of uh vermac composting with kitchen

1156
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:30,719
scraps I have worm Tower right outside

1157
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:32,279
my kitchen door so I just toss a lot of

1158
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:34,519
my food scraps in there give it to the

1159
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,798
worms awesome yeah it gives the audience

1160
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:38,679
some options they can uh do some

1161
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:40,119
Googling and and research anything that

1162
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:42,358
interests them and they can learn more

1163
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:44,838
how to do that process absolutely now

1164
00:50:42,358 --> 00:50:46,558
how about for Pest Control a lot of

1165
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:48,838
people want to really go the allnatural

1166
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,920
route when it comes to controlling pests

1167
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:54,599
or preventing pests what are some best

1168
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:56,440
knf or jadam Pest Control solutions for

1169
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:59,798
indoor garden yeah that's a great

1170
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:04,240
question question so uh with the knf

1171
00:50:59,798 --> 00:51:06,838
side it's um there's not a whole lot of

1172
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:09,318
pesticides that we make in the k&amp;f

1173
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:11,000
system it's more preventative measures

1174
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:14,719
and those preventative measures are

1175
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,480
really built in the diversity that we're

1176
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:17,639
building first of all in the soil with

1177
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,559
the the

1178
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:22,078
microbiome and so we're building a lot

1179
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:25,480
of resistance on our plants with the

1180
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:29,480
higher bricks level um that is created

1181
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:31,798
through these cultures of of IMO um and

1182
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:34,679
then we can use like you know bio

1183
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:38,920
remediation like uh Labs is a good one

1184
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:42,440
to com combat like uh mildew and things

1185
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:46,358
like that um in the phosphere even in

1186
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:49,079
the soil and then jadam has a lot more

1187
00:51:46,358 --> 00:51:52,440
to offer on the side of like you know

1188
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:54,440
our our uh pesticides so jadam teaches

1189
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:57,318
how to make a Horticultural soap a

1190
00:51:54,440 --> 00:52:00,159
wedding agent and then with that you can

1191
00:51:57,318 --> 00:52:02,119
team that soap with many different uh

1192
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:05,159
herbal uh

1193
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:07,960
extractions uh to I mean the this guy is

1194
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:10,239
the limit with different um extractions

1195
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:12,720
that you can use with the Horticultural

1196
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:15,358
soap one of my favorites when I was in

1197
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:18,118
Hol County was using the California bay

1198
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:21,358
laurel um introduced that to the Natural

1199
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:23,318
farming Community years ago uh because I

1200
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:26,358
was studying herbalism and found that

1201
00:52:23,318 --> 00:52:28,279
the Native Americans of that region use

1202
00:52:26,358 --> 00:52:30,920
the the bay laurel which has this really

1203
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:33,160
fragrance super high uh essential oil

1204
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:35,480
content in the leaves it's just very

1205
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:38,078
powerful um and the Native Americans

1206
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:40,838
would take and they would um they would

1207
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,680
protect some of like the egg corn meal

1208
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:45,000
they were making they would surround it

1209
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:46,598
with the bay laurel to keep pests away

1210
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,838
and I was like reading about that like

1211
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:52,760
oh that could be used in jadam as a

1212
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:56,078
pesticide and so I started distilling uh

1213
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:59,119
bayoro leaves and found that um yeah the

1214
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:02,039
uh essal oils like have are are great

1215
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:05,000
for you know aphids they really really

1216
00:53:02,039 --> 00:53:08,679
effective on aphids um successfully took

1217
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,639
care of a huge infestation of um aphids

1218
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:13,358
on a hemp crop in in Oregon and uh had a

1219
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:15,719
lot of other friends doing pretty large

1220
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:19,558
scale stuff using the bay laurel with a

1221
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:22,919
lot of uh you know um positive results I

1222
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:25,559
mean basically within like 99% of the

1223
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:28,358
community of aphids was destroyed in two

1224
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:30,760
applications that's super interesting to

1225
00:53:28,358 --> 00:53:32,960
me bay laurel is actually it's around

1226
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:35,079
here a lot and I was considering putting

1227
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,480
in as like privacy bushes so I didn't

1228
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:39,440
realize that they could have other uses

1229
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:42,159
for me so that's that's really exciting

1230
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:45,599
to me yeah absolutely it's it's a it's

1231
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:46,639
amazing uh tree up in Oregon it's um

1232
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,720
Oregon

1233
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:52,000
Myrtlewood and um they they have a

1234
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:55,279
different name my ex-girlfriend who was

1235
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,280
an herbalist used to joke around with me

1236
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,680
um no it's Oregon or murwood and I'd say

1237
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,040
no it's California bayoro and we were

1238
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:04,960
both

1239
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:07,119
right so I imagine all of these things

1240
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,000
when it comes to Natural farming a lot

1241
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,680
of folks they're afraid that they're

1242
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,199
going to make mistakes and I'd like to

1243
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:13,679
go over some of the common mistakes that

1244
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:15,358
new Growers make when trying to

1245
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:17,159
implement some of these permaculture

1246
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:18,920
techniques can you break it down for us

1247
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:20,879
maybe some of the things maybe top two

1248
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:23,480
or three that come to your mind of

1249
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,358
mistakes that new folks make and how

1250
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,920
they can be avoided or corrected well

1251
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:30,598
the biggest one that comes to mind for

1252
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:33,400
me is you know living soil systems

1253
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:36,240
regenerative farming systems that were

1254
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,920
uh emulating natural processes you know

1255
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:41,358
they take time and so I know we kind of

1256
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,559
live in an instant gratification modern

1257
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:45,119
culture and I would say that's probably

1258
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:48,400
one of the biggest ones is that we need

1259
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:49,760
to be patient and enjoy the process uh

1260
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,880
it's okay to learn through our our

1261
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:55,799
failures our mistakes and uh those just

1262
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,720
make us better the next times around and

1263
00:54:55,798 --> 00:55:01,440
so I would say that's probably one of

1264
00:54:57,719 --> 00:55:04,358
the biggest ones um you know it's it's

1265
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,559
the old story of uh the moral of the the

1266
00:55:04,358 --> 00:55:09,598
tortoise in the hair you know it's

1267
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:13,200
better to be uh slow and effective and

1268
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:15,760
efficient than you know fast and Hasty

1269
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:19,439
and so I think with the the regenerative

1270
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:22,880
farming methods um you know take the

1271
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:27,318
tortoise's example there and uh be

1272
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:28,280
patient with the process and um

1273
00:55:27,318 --> 00:55:30,838
other

1274
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:33,559
mistakes uh the companion plants are a

1275
00:55:30,838 --> 00:55:39,119
big one when it comes to

1276
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:41,319
permaculture and Copic Agro forestry um

1277
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,798
that was a big one for me was learning

1278
00:55:41,318 --> 00:55:47,239
how important the companion plants are

1279
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:49,679
to you know um to that system because

1280
00:55:47,239 --> 00:55:52,239
those are more systems approaches we're

1281
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:54,919
looking more ecology rather than just

1282
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:57,919
like a monoculture uh we're focused on

1283
00:55:54,920 --> 00:56:01,318
the system so really focusing more on

1284
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:03,599
the system and those support plants and

1285
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:05,759
how important they are to cycle you know

1286
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:08,519
nutrients into the system not just

1287
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,920
looking at you know our Target crop um

1288
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:13,639
we're literally growing our own you know

1289
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:16,000
fertilizers uh with Copic Agro forestry

1290
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:19,038
it's it's more of a principle based

1291
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,079
method than an input-based method yeah I

1292
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:23,559
I'm sure we can get much much deeper

1293
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:25,720
into so many different aspects of things

1294
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:28,400
cover crops companion planting mulch

1295
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:30,118
layers and Tropic Agro foresty I'd like

1296
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,480
to invite you back on for a part two at

1297
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:33,599
some point in the future if you'd be

1298
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,280
willing to get into some of these things

1299
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,318
deeper coming up towards the end of the

1300
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,720
podcast here so I'd like to wrap things

1301
00:56:37,318 --> 00:56:40,880
up but yeah if you're down for a part

1302

1308
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,838
an incredible uh way to to farm and I

1309

1311

consortiums and uh you know those uh

1312
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,920
those intervals that we can plant in so

1313
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:09,239
