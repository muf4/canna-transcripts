take that down to a third due to a third

80
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,439
party complaint we won't get into the

81
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:57,839

is Jordan River I host growcast podcast

those places tune in to the show I'm

107
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,239
sure you'll love it but for me uh it

108
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:51,680
started as a medicinal Journey when I

109
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,920
was a teenager I suffered from uh Grand

110
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,560
Mall seizures so I started to get into

111
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,399
medicinal plants as a teenager um and

112
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,680
using them but not cultivating them you

113
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,360
know what I mean so it was actually kind

114
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,319
kind of an up and down ride with my

115
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,920
health and with my epilepsy um probably

116
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:08,158
because of the availability of the

117
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:10,479
products back then I wasn't growing my

118
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,318
own medicine at the time but I got

119
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,798
really into the medicinal side I ended

120
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,918
up moving to Humble County at age 20 and

121
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,160
started growing I'll uh never forget I

122
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,680
don't know if I've even told this story

123
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,280
before on my podcast but it all started

124
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,000
when I was walking down the streets of

125
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:27,119
Chicago I'm from the Chicago land area

126
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,879
and we went into the city for a night

127
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,560
out me and my sister and my parents and

128
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,719
I was walking down the street talking to

129
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,240
my sister about how you know Time

130

132
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,000
said I want to go to Humble County and

133
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,360

136
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,198
and this and that and he connects me

137
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,720
with Uncle Jackie connects me with

138
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,520
cousin Benny these are all like family

139
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,759
members um who have sometimes been on

140
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:58,719
the show and they put me in touch with

141
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,038
the boys in Humble and it was just from

142
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,680
there it was it was all fate man I ended

143
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:06,000
up moving to Humble County um finding

144
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,160
Wolfman my co-host uh he was working at

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,240
Bayside Garden Supply so we got together

146
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,439
um I spent five years there providing

147
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,280
medicine for patients which was some of

148
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,199
the best years of my life and then at 24

149
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:20,000
25 I started recording with wolf man we

150
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,600
turned on the microphones we said hey

151
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,519
man every time we get together we can't

152
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,199
not talk about gardening so we might as

153
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:27,959
well just turn on the microphones and

154
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,120
broadcast this to the people so that's

155
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,918
how it started um and now I do growcast

156
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,680
as a full-time thing our mission is

157
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:38,399
overgrow the idea of overgrow is simple

158
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,639
if everybody who wanted to grow did grow

159
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,599
we would all have enough fresh

160
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:44,160
vegetables and fresh medicine available

161
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,639
for everybody um so that's what we're

162
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,160
doing you can come along like I said

163
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:48,639

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,280
islands actually it's a pretty small

166
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:54,719
feno hunt um but it's it's going to be a

167
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:56,198
lot of fun so come and follow along and

168
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,840
uh we'll see how this goes we'll see if

169
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,038
I don't fall flat on my face here in the

170
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,038
islands that's awesome and as as usual I

171
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:04,478
will have a link to the guest in the

172
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,318
description section below so Jordan I'll

173
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,399
have you a link to your channel down in

174
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,639
the description section Below on YouTube

175
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,519
and then if you're on one of the podcast

176
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,439
platforms just listening just search

177
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,038
growcast it'll come up there in the

178
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,918
search and then you'll be able to tune

179
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,680
into his content feno hunting man let's

180
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,120
get into it let's step it back for the

181
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,280
beginners though first because I have

182
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,959
quite a few beginners here they might

183
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:27,559
not know what a phenotype is they might

184
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:29,598
not know what a genotype is can you

185
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,759
break down those two things for us what

186
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:35,038
is a phenotype what is a genotype sure

187
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,240
absolutely so I like to compare it to

188
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,199
humans it's really easy to understand

189
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,360
when two parents have a child that child

190
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,439
is uniquely its own individual and that

191
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,439
child inherits many of the traits from

192
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:50,000
their parents right oh you got blue eyes

193
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:53,000
just like your dad inherited that trait

194
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,759
the genotype is the actual genetic

195
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,519
coding and the traits that got inherited

196
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,520
from the parents so that's like the

197
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:03,758
hardcoded data genotype is in the DNA it

198
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,839
is it it are traits that are present or

199
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,639
not present that determine how the plant

200
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:12,159
is going to express for instance able to

201
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,240
produce anthocyanin that purple purple

202
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,720
pigment that many plants produce or not

203
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,639
able to produce anthocyanin if the plant

204
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,000
is not able to produce anthocyanin

205
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,199
there's nothing you can do to coax that

206
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,240
expression out of it that's the genotype

207
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,120
it's the actual genetic information that

208
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,918
was inherited from the parent

209
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,120
plants now

210
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:35,799
phenotype is how that plant expresses

211
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,360
it's how it turns out because there's a

212
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,680
lot of variability in there phenotype

213
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,240
includes environment it includes you how

214
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,439
are you fertig gating what's your

215
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,360
nutrient schedule what's your

216
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:49,439
environment like uh as far as the

217
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,199
climate this all plays into phenotype

218
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,120
expression and that is why your

219
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,478
phenotype is uniquely your phenotype you

220
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,360
may have seen before that someone will

221
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:59,839
get the same plant they'll get a cutting

222
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,759
of a plant and grow it and it turns out

223
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,878
different than their buddy maybe their

224
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,840
buddy even grew it in a very similar

225
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:07,759
indoor controlled environment but it

226
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,918
just came out different funny how that

227
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,759
came out different right well those are

228
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:12,038
the phenotype those are the phenotypical

229
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,319
differences right those are the

230
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:17,279
phenotypes expressing themselves so

231
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,000
genetics also change over time this is

232
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,758
something that's really important to to

233
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,399
understand especially when you're

234
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,598
dealing with medicinal plants um because

235
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,679
environment does affect your genes right

236
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:28,519
the way epigenetics work is that

237
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,199
genetics affect our outcomes and our

238
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:33,079
actions affect our genetics if you smoke

239
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,719
a pack a day and your kid smokes a pack

240
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,399
a day and their kid smokes a pack a day

241
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,839
of cigarettes their progyny is going to

242
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,038
have different predispositions than if

243
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,719
you had not taken those actions right

244
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:46,319
that's why doctors want to know if you

245
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,680
have a family history of this or that

246
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,160
same thing happens with plants genetics

247
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:54,159
will alter the DNA over time viruses and

248
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,838
viroids will will get into the genetic

249
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,399
code and change the way they express and

250
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:59,959
when it comes to plants what we're

251
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,000
really talking about is not so much

252
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:06,078
smoking a pack a day but the terroir the

253
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,839
Terre this idea of the totality of the

254
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:11,078
plant's habitat affecting how the plant

255
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,720
expresses itself the dirt you know the

256
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:14,919
way that the soil and the microbes in

257
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,800
the soil affect that plant's flavor the

258
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:20,479
Salt Air something something about it

259
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:22,439
right that's the terroir and terroir

260
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,039
influences and changes genetics over

261
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,839
time I'll give you an example I'm out

262
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:30,078
here in Hawaii and I was talking to some

263
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,399
ogs about Maui woi and when it comes to

264
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:34,078
Providence you know a lot of people have

265
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,519
different stories and uh when it comes

266
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:37,639
to Maui wa they're saying this is a

267
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,600
wakan plant this is a Mexican plant that

268
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:43,319
was brought to Hawaii and acclimated

269
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,879
over several decades it changed the way

270
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,640
it expresses and now it's a different uh

271
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:52,639
a different variety than we're used to

272
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:55,399
so again it's about the genotype which

273
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,159
is the hardcoded inherited traits it's

274
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,879
about the phenotype which includes that

275
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:02,719
environment and that environment really

276
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:05,519
is terroir which will alter your your uh

277
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,399
genetic Expressions over time so it's

278
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,519
pretty interesting stuff that's a good

279
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,000
beginner friendly way to explain it and

280
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:13,519
I'm glad you broke it down like that

281
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,440
because again we have so many beginners

282
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,679
that are tuning into this they don't

283
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,440
know what phenotype is what genotype is

284
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,599
so I think that's an easily digestible

285
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,760
way of explaining it so thanks for

286
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,480
breaking that down to begin now pheno

287
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:29,559
hunting is a little bit different right

288
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,399
that's what you're doing right now

289
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:35,199
what is feno hunting and why would you

290
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:38,039
do it oh I love it man um and you know

291
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,879
what Mr Grow speaking to the beginners

292
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,719
is what it's all about man that's what

293
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:43,600
it's all about if you can't convey your

294
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,519
information to a beginner your

295
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,200
information isn't very valuable I don't

296
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,240
care how much stuff you've got up here

297
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,879
right so for you to to cater to

298
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,799
beginners and to get more people growing

299
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,399
that's what overgrow is all about so I

300
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,599
love the idea of like what is pheno

301
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,639
hunting how would you explain it to

302
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,920
somebody I want to start with a story uh

303
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:05,039
a story story about a conversation I had

304
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:06,919
with a non-er friend and he said Jordan

305
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,480
you care for these plants so much you

306
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:11,599
you you know name them and and coddle

307
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,600
them and talk to them and grow them up

308
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,759
perfectly healthy and then at the end of

309
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,120
their life cycle you kill them you chop

310
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:22,000
them down so you burn them sometimes he

311
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,159
said do you ever feel bad about that I

312
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,278
thought it was a really funny an

313
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:26,838
interesting question and I was like yeah

314
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:28,480
you do care for this plant and then

315
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,160
eventually it's going to end up you know

316
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,720
being thrown in the fire so to speak and

317
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:36,519
I said no I don't feel bad about that

318
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,480
unequivocally the answer is no and the

319
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:42,879
reason why is something called the

320
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:47,000
Botany of Desire this is a concept that

321
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:48,600
plants want to please us plants want to

322
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,278
fulfill our

323
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,079
desires and it's beneficial for them as

324
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:56,519
a species so let me explain plants have

325
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,719
been on this planet much longer than

326
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,320
humans have plants have been on this

327
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,959
planet hundreds of Millions ions of

328
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,560
years we're only a couple handful of

329
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,879
thousand as humans roaming this planet

330
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:08,958
so plants are very Adept at surviving

331
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:12,120
and proliferating and and you know

332
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:13,599
spreading their species across the

333
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,919
planet and one of the ways they do this

334
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,278
is they actually use animals and they

335
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:21,838
use us as humans because if plants can

336
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,879
express themselves in ways that are

337
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,880
desirable to us you look pretty you

338
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:30,480
smell good you fulfill some sort of

339
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,838
medicinal need that I that you know you

340
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,639
you ease an ailment in my body these are

341
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,920
all ways that plants please us and what

342
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:41,000
does that lead to well it leads to us

343
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:43,198
proliferating those plants right that's

344
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,799
why you're sending your rare seeds to

345
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:49,639
your buddy in Europe and you know this

346
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,240
plant is now spreading across the globe

347
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:54,480
because it was able to please you that's

348
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,399
all plants like a lot of the ones that

349
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,039
we grow that's all they want to do is

350
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,559
please our desires fulfill our

351
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:07,120
desires and you know when we get into

352
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,679
gardening the first goal is to just keep

353
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,120
our plants healthy right you want to you

354
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:12,159
want to see this plant to the end of its

355
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,600
life cycle and and make sure it doesn't

356
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:18,480
die but once we get Adept we reach the

357
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,079
end game which is basically hunting

358
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,600
through these plants becoming willing

359
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:25,759
victims of the botney of desire and

360
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,399
finding the ones that please us the most

361
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,720
finding the ones that are most desirable

362
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,159
and then usually proliferating those

363
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,399
that is the cycle that is the cycle and

364
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,278
if you think about it from that meta

365
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,679
perspective it's really trippy it's

366
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:42,799
really bizarre I will probably toil for

367
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:44,799
the rest of my life until I die looking

368
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,278
through these seeds I'm sure some of you

369
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:47,639
could go through your seed collection

370
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:49,759
and you couldn't get to all of them

371
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,120
before you died you're going to spend

372
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,519
the rest of your life looking through

373
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,159
these seeds finding the ones that are

374
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:56,000
most desirable for you and then

375
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,120
spreading them around that's kind of the

376
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,078
end game of this cultivation thing man

377
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,519
like I said you get get good at the

378
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,319
actual practice and then what well you

379
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,198
want to you want to cross some of your

380
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,199
own cultivars you want to take those two

381
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:10,758
pepper plants that are your favorite and

382
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,120
and bang them together and make new

383
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,959
seeds and share them with your friends

384
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,320
maybe even send them to another country

385
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:20,679
like I said what other organism is so

386
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,639
smart to please us to the point where we

387
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:25,359
send them across the globe it's

388
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,399
beautiful so how many seeds do you need

389
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,320
in order for a fenal hunt I think that a

390
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,720
lot of people think that you need to

391
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,040
be actually growing hundreds and

392
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,560
hundreds of plants in order to do a true

393
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:39,399
fenal hunt which is just isn't true in

394
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,399
your opinion how many seeds should you

395
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,519
be kind of hunting through in order to

396
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,839
try to find what you're looking for this

397
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:49,399
is a great question it gets brought up

398
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:52,120
all the time and my view personally is a

399
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:56,000
little more homeg grower empowering and

400
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,560
small cultivator empowering um you know

401
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,919
it's funny it's like how many do you

402
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:01,599
need to constitute

403
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,958
an actual pheno

404
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,480
hunt and there are answers in Academia

405
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,758
and there there are specific ones but I

406
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,199
broke it down really what is the idea of

407
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,639
hunting a phenotype I mean

408
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:15,719
really anytime you pop a seed you're

409
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:17,278
hunting a phenotype so I used to say

410
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,920
like okay what constitutes a hun a hunt

411
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,480
maybe two like all the way down to two

412
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,120
so you can compare them maybe even just

413
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,879
one popping one seed should be

414
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,360
considered a pheno hunt in my opinion um

415
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:30,198
but there are answers like I said in

416
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,680
Academia the number is 16 16 seeds will

417
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:34,159
give you a representation of this

418
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,239
cultivar and that has to do with math

419
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,480
and punet squares right how they break

420
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,639
down these different genetics basically

421
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,159
you can remember from from biology class

422
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,959
they make these predictability squares

423
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:46,679
that allow you to track genetic

424
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,479
attributes and and how often they pass

425
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,239
down and how dominant they are um and

426
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,319
they all come in fours and four time 4

427
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,519
is 16 so Academia says 16 I'm doing 30

428
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:59,240
because it's what I can fit I say run

429
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:02,720
what you can fit as far as seeing what a

430
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,600
plant is capable of I like a 100 I like

431
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,480
a 100 I think that that's a good way to

432
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,040
see a lot of what this seed has to

433
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,720
offer

434
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:14,159
um now don't let anyone tell you that

435
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,000
you're not a pheno hunter because you're

436
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,879
not popping enough seeds that is the

437
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,318
only disempowering view that I stand

438
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,559
against it's like I think there's a lot

439
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:24,240
of that being thrown around you're a

440
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,679
pollen chucker you're not a breeder

441
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,159
you're just popping a seed you're not a

442
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,120
feno hunter I don't believe in any of

443
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:31,759
that I think if you're hunting genetic

444
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,039
traits you are a pheno hunter so my view

445
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,039
is very empowering in that regard not to

446
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:37,439
get too far off track but I do want to

447
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:38,639
add you you brought up pollen chucking

448
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,360
now a lot of people are against pollen

449
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,600
chucking you're you think it's okay

450
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,600
you're you're completely fine with that

451
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,879
I mean listen it's different it's it's

452
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,199
everybody has their own values and

453
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:51,759
principles right but to me if you breed

454
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:54,359
something you are a

455
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,199
breeder I don't I I know that there's a

456
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,720
difference between just putting two

457
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:59,519
things together and then actually doing

458
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,278
like a full IB I understand that those

459
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:06,240
are differences but the word breeder to

460
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:08,038
me means one who breeds and I can't tell

461
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,160
you some of the best genetics I've ever

462
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:13,558
gotten were just a guy in his basement

463
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,439
that had two strains that he liked and

464
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:17,240
he put them together and I'm like this

465
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,919
is an amazing cross and he's going yeah

466
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,919
but I'm not a real breeder I hate to see

467
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,959
that type of limiting belief there's no

468
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,600
difference between what you made in your

469
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,679
garden than the guy who did 100 plant

470
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:31,119
feno hunt yours is just a small

471
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:34,559
selection so I like to empower people

472
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:37,079
breeding is easy breeding is easy and

473
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:39,119
fun and I think everyone should do it so

474
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:41,279
that's my that's my view it's

475
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,639
interesting you say that I did a podcast

476
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:47,319
episode several years ago now with Vader

477
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,000
OG Ocean Grown Genetics and uh I had

478
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:51,159
mentioned to him he you know I did my

479
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,599
first cross I crossed but I don't really

480
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,960
consider myself a breeder you know I

481
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:57,599
just did this one cross and he's like no

482
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,960
you're a breeder you did a cross you

483
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,678
crossed a plant

484
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,279
know you took pollen for one plant

485
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:04,320
pollinated a female and made seeds

486
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:07,639
that's breeding so you're a breeder and

487
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:09,558
I'm like well okay then totally sense

488
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,400
and you just mirrored exactly what he

489
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:14,240
had mentioned in that talk so that's

490
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,240
pretty cool to hear yeah absolutely man

491
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,000
and I completely agree and I like to

492
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,519
look at my principles and values as okay

493
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,200
well what's the result if the result is

494
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:23,759
telling people hey it is easy showing

495
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,558
people how to do it and saying you are a

496
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,759
breeder that means more medicine more

497
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:30,319
seeds if you're there gatekeeping and

498
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,200
putting people and calling people names

499
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:34,319
because they didn't do it the way you do

500
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,038
it that's just going to result in less

501
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,639
people growing that is the definition of

502
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:40,240
gatekeeping in my opinion um and I don't

503
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,320
obviously I don't condone people like

504
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,480
releasing unstable genetics into the

505
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,599
gene pool and not telling people but

506
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,360
that's not usually what's happening man

507
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:50,079
usually you've got really desirable

508
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:52,119
cultivars being crossed to really

509
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,000
desirable cultivars and a lot of fun

510
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:55,918
stuff coming out of it so that's what I

511
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,798
like to see is as many people doing it

512
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,799
as possible well said so back to hunting

513
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:04,839
are you pheno hunting male plants female

514
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:07,720
plants or both um this is a great

515
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:10,918
question I I have a few goals with this

516
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:14,000
feno hunt the first is to just find

517
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:16,520
plants that do well on Maliki there's a

518
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,319
lot of environmental pressures here and

519
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:19,440
so I want a plant that'll survive here

520
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,119
first and

521
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,320
foremost from there I hope to find

522
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,918
something really special sorry we've got

523
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:29,158
some heavy winds it's the it's the

524
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:31,080
nature of recording outside I hope to

525
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:33,159
find something really special um I would

526
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:34,798
take a male I would take a female and

527
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:38,200
and the idea is to get it back to our

528
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,879
head breeder riseo Rich right um he's

529
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,798
been working on some incredible stuff

530
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,600
and I would love to see something uh go

531
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:45,038
back to him but every feno Hunt is

532
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,639
different and I like to encourage people

533
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,279
to base your feno hunting and your

534
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,880
gardening in general around a mission

535
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:55,200
around a mission or an idea or or you

536
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,440
know something that you can work towards

537
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,080
because if you a goal right if you want

538
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,679
to see a certain profile that you feel

539
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:02,359
like is dead and resurrected that's a

540
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:04,000
beautiful Mission if you're looking for

541
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:06,798
a certain plant that's going to help you

542
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,159
with your medical issues and and ease

543
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:09,558
some of your ailments that is a

544
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,480
beautiful beautiful Mission and that's

545
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:13,918
going to determine just about everything

546
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,038
that's your guiding star what you're

547
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,400
aiming at on the flip side of that coin

548
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,000
is you kind of have to work with what

549
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,200
you're given so if I really really want

550
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,640
a good mail but I pop a bunch and

551
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,519
there's just nothing that's that

552
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,600
desirable the last thing I want to do is

553
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:30,038
select a subpar mail because wanted a

554
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:33,079
mail and then go forward with that

555
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:36,599
project I want to be wowed and impressed

556
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:39,439
and spoken to that's one of the only

557
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:41,759
hard and fast recommendations and rules

558
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,880
that I would say for a pheno hunter is

559
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:46,480
don't kid yourself you need to find

560
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,440
plants that speak to you that wow you

561
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,919
that knock your socks off that's what

562
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,759
you want to go forward with and if it's

563
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,400
not exactly what you were originally

564
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,359
planning sometimes you got to call an

565
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,038
audible sometimes you got to change up

566
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:58,798
the game plan that's one of the reasons

567
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,798
I really like the work that rich does

568
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:05,319
because he will never sacrifice quality

569
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:07,038
and impressiveness to fulfill a goal um

570
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:08,839
but that being said I do like to have

571
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,079
goals in mind and for this one I want to

572
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:12,158
find one that's going to do well in the

573
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,639
wet season that's going to uh not

574
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,640
succumb to powder Milo and Bud rot I

575
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,240
want to find one that's going to um also

576
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,960
do well for the rest of the year here

577
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,200
and kind of go from there and then if we

578
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,400
can incorporate that in the work we're

579
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,558
doing that's just wow that's beautiful

580
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,240
so I I have low expectations for this

581
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:32,000
run I'm just trying not to get my plants

582
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,440
covered in powdery mildew and uh and

583
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,679
budworms so that makes sense so you

584
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,038
really have to have like a clear mind on

585
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:41,600
what you're looking for when you begin

586
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,079
it sounds like now you mentioned that

587
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:44,959
it's a little bit different there in

588
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:46,278
Hawaii I'm assuming you've done fenal

589
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,079
hunts in other areas where you lived

590
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:51,119
before what is the big difference there

591
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:52,599
do you have any tips for folks cuz

592
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,639
really we got people from all the world

593
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:56,759
tuning in right is there anything

594
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,559
specific area wise that people need to

595
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:01,038
know when they're doing a feno hunt yeah

596
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:03,079
absolutely man I think this is why it's

597
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:06,278
so important to feno hunt especially for

598
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:07,759
outdoor Growers because you are you are

599
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:10,038
basically going to succumb to the

600
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,759
environment to some degree and you need

601
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,278
to have plants that do well in that

602
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:16,119
environment it's not the same as growing

603
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:18,079
in a tent I've done little feno hunts

604
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:19,798
popping packs of seeds in my 5x5 and

605
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:23,079
things like that or back when I was in

606
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:25,720
Humble popping seeds here or there um

607
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:28,798
but this is different because it's an

608
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,440
outdoor ined living soil grow now

609
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,000
luckily I've connected with a guy he's a

610
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,919
he's a guest on my show Maliki Kevin

611
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,038
he's been doing it for 11 years out here

612
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,400
so that's really beneficial

613
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:39,879
because again the reason why you need to

614
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,480
pheno hunt and find stuff that works in

615
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,760
your environment is your environment is

616
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:47,200
different than mine your environment is

617
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:49,240
unique and there are lots of cultivars

618
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,038
that aren't going to do well in certain

619
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,558
conditions you got to look through the

620
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:55,919
genetic gene pool and find what thrives

621
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:57,440
in your local so here we have to deal

622
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,679
with really specific stuff right now

623
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,880
it's the wet season so it's extremely

624
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,240
humid it's cool out but it's I mean it's

625
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,760
super wet like you don't even want to

626
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,640
have Mulch on your living soil beds wet

627
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:10,798
there's standing water you know it'll

628
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,159
turn to soup if you if there's a heavy

629
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:14,679
rain and you water it and there's mulch

630
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:16,080
so you know we want cultivars that are

631
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:17,640
mold resistant we want cultivars that

632
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,558
will Thrive well in high humidity that

633
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,880
can deal with overwatering well these

634
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:23,720
are all really specific attributes that

635
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,200
are basically just going to you know

636
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,798
weed out the weak The Only the Strong

637
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,919
Will Survive but everybody's uh

638
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:31,319
environment is completely unique

639
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,120
everybody's Garden is unique and that's

640
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:35,839
why you need to be hunting for your

641
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,798
space now I will say one thing here I

642
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:39,319
think the word resistant probably gets

643
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:40,839
thrown out a lot when you're talking

644
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,918
about people working in their

645
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:45,839
environments and breeding they'll say

646
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:48,080
hey I am in a human environment I ran a

647
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,399
bunch of seeds five of them got powdery

648
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,839
mildew one did not therefore this one is

649
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,080
a mold resistant cultivar I would be

650
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:57,119
pretty I would be reticent to say

651
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:00,720
something like that but what I will say

652
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:03,839
is it works well here it resisted this

653
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,038
species of mold it it survived and

654
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:08,199
thrived during during these

655
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:10,278
stressers saying something is pest

656
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,038
resistant or milder resistant I'm always

657
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:14,759
a little bit hesitant too many times

658
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:16,158
have I seen those claims then prove out

659
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:19,359
to be you know wrong in a different

660
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,440
environment but what is 100% true is you

661
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,678
can find a cvar that does well in your

662
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,278
environment with your stressors and then

663
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,320
keep that over time and and keep it

664
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:28,880
there and give it out to local Growers

665
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:31,558
especially important with the outdoor

666
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,240
Growers I'm now learning yeah I've

667
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:35,440
always wondered like when say they say

668
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,079
oh it's resistance to pow Milo or

669
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,960
resistance to past and I mean how do you

670
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,720
prove that couldn't anybody just say oh

671
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,360
yeah this is resistant to potery Milo

672
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,079
right is there like is there any testing

673
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,839
that can be done to like prove that in

674
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:50,879
the genetics it is resistant or no so in

675
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,240
coffee I like to work in coffee that's

676
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,799
my other big medicinal plant I mean I

677
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,480
love all plants don't get me wrong but

678
00:24:54,798 --> 00:25:00,398
in coffee they have to have strict

679
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,079
guidelines to say something like that

680
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:05,639
you have to do a double blind controlled

681
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:07,879
study with a with a you know coffee

682
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,080
Institute at Vanderbilt University or

683
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,000
whatever and and like I said it's a

684
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,079
control they have these large scale

685
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,880
grows so so it's not just a small sample

686
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,798
size they have two of them and one of

687
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,240
them they will introduce the coffee Bor

688
00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:23,359
or Beetle or they will introduce coffee

689
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,359
rust and you have to get you have to get

690
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:27,119
white papers published and peer reviewed

691
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,759
on this stuff before you can go out

692
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,239
there and say hey here's a mold

693
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:33,079
resistant coffeee cultivar okay so that

694
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,640
doesn't really exist in our world

695
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:36,519
they're on the medicinal side of things

696
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,759
right virtually non-existent nobody's

697
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:40,798
doing that so I I do like to see people

698
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:42,079
doing like smaller controlled studies of

699
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,720
that there are some people who do

700
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,960
release some pests into their garden and

701
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,120
document it but generally that's just

702
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,360
not happening you know outside of big

703
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:54,558
big crops and and like I said

704
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:55,918
universities usually conducting a lot of

705
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:58,240
these studies Coffee university of

706
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,559
Brazil uh again Vanderbilt University

707
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,120
study coffee science studies um these

708
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,759
are the places that like do those types

709
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:06,639
of testing and will actually give you a

710
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:08,919
white paper that says congratulations

711
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,520
you have found a mold resistant cultivar

712
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:13,759
doesn't really exist in other plants

713
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:16,639
that's really interesting okay so you

714
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,599
said you current fenan is 30 seeds

715
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,679
you're outdoors in a living soil bed

716
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:23,278
what are you using for like organic

717
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:24,559
inputs throughout the grow cycle yeah

718
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,000
this is an interesting one here on the

719
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,158
islands and it's made me rethink about a

720
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,398
lot of things

721
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,840
but here we don't have access to a lot

722
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:34,839
of stuff I'm used to Amazon being my

723
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:37,079
best friend you know what I mean AC

724
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:40,038
infinity.com hit up rooted leaf.com

725
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:42,720
we're we're rolling okay Amazon takes

726
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:44,879
like 3 4 weeks to get anything here you

727
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,278
know Walmart and Target is faster come

728
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,919
on Walmart garden center let's go

729
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:50,798
where's the AC Infinity tense but but

730
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:52,880
Amazon takes a long time to get out here

731
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:55,158
so so basically you have to use what you

732
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,399
have around you and that works well with

733
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:00,640
all our style of growing what's crazy Mr

734
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:04,278
Grow is everybody on the island who

735
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,759
grows grows sustainably not just because

736
00:27:04,278 --> 00:27:08,480
the organic scene is Big here but

737
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:10,919
because you have to you have to if you

738
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,679
want nitrogen the easiest way to get it

739
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:17,600
is to make some fish aminos right the

740
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:20,840
easiest way to get kelp is to go Harvest

741
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:23,079
kelp out of the ocean uh cocoa quar is

742
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,439
all over the island it's you throw those

743
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:27,398
coconut hust right into a chipper and it

744
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,960
comes out like fluffy gold like pillows

745
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:31,678
of gold it's really really interesting

746
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,440
how there's so much closed loop farming

747
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,440
out of necessity here and I'm going to

748
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,880
be employing a lot of those practices on

749
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,278
this run um that being said I did sneak

750
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,640
some secret weapons here I've got my

751
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:44,159
rooted Leaf I've got some things that I

752
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,320
I know are going to be are going to be

753
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,200
beneficial but mostly listen I'm not

754
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:49,879
looking to reinvent the wheel I am I'm

755
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,200
going to the 11 plus year Growers who

756
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,919
have been doing it here and say what do

757
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,240
you do you know I say let's interplant

758
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,720
some basil in this bed and they say yeah

759
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,440
but that's going to attract spit bubg

760
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,640
bus and I go what the H are spit

761
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,240
bugs and they explain to me there's this

762
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,278
bug on the island they love basil you

763
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,759
were just about to attract them into

764
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:09,599
your garden and ruin everything but you

765
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:11,720
didn't know because you haven't been

766
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,240
growing here so I'm not looking to

767
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,600
reinvent the wheel I'm I'm following

768
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:20,359
these guys Malachi is historically the

769
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:22,359
grower Island um you can see all the

770
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:23,918
Growers when you fly in if you fly in at

771
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:26,278
a Night Flight you'll see all the flood

772
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,519
lights in the backyards and and that's

773
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:29,759
to keep uh their plants awake at night

774
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:32,278
because the light cycles here are

775
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,558
different and uh has a rich history of

776
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:35,960
growing here and specifically

777
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:40,639
sustainable growing so we've got a

778
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:44,399
biowaste a green waste remediated medium

779
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,799
um that uses Cinder local Cinder as the

780
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,199
airation and uh you know they make their

781
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,599
own microbes here they make bam

782
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,038
beneficial anerobic microbes and we're

783
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,480
just doing it local that's

784
00:28:52,038 --> 00:28:55,079
sustainability by the way just CU you're

785
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,000
a soil grower doesn't mean you shouldn't

786
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:59,398
take a look at your sustainability and

787
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,240
say how can I close these Loops I'm I've

788
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:03,119
definitely been guilty of that before

789
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,079
and grow how you're going to grow but if

790
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:06,839
you want to grow sustainably it's about

791
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:08,879
closing that Loop more than anything

792
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:11,000
else you know I think that's a a good

793
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,120
end goal there is to be able to do that

794
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,798
definitely helps the environment

795
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:17,158
eco-friendly now can you do a pheno hunt

796
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,960
in multiple mediums let's say could you

797
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:20,480
do like a Hydroponics have some plants

798
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,640
in Hydroponics and some plants in living

799
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,839
soil and then do a pheno hunt that way

800
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,440
also two-part question here is there any

801
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,959
benefit to just doing a fenal hunt in

802
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,360
Hydroponics will you have that more

803
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,679
Precision control over the inputs so

804
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:37,119
when people ask about like how to grow

805
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:39,480
during a pheno hun I always say grow the

806
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,759
way that you know how to grow grow the

807
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,079
way that you can grow them healthy and

808
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:45,158
see their full potential expression just

809
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:47,278
kind of kind of two sides to that coin

810
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:48,720
which is you want to grow them well so

811
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:50,558
you can see how well they express

812
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,120
themselves but you also want to see what

813
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:54,278
they do when things aren't perfect that

814
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:57,599
can be very very telling and

815
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:59,558
beneficial um so yes there are benefits

816
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:01,158
to growing in Coco where uh I'm sorry to

817
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:03,158
growing in a hydro setup where you can

818
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:04,919
really fine-tune and test those things

819
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:06,480
if that's what you're looking to do get

820
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:09,360
data like that that's one of the best

821
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,480
ways you can do it but I always say do

822
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:14,199
what works for you uh whatever Medium

823
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,599
you're currently doing well in do that

824
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,360
there are some benefits to small pots

825
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:20,079
being able to move things around remove

826
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:21,879
things overwater things easily

827
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:23,599
underwater things easily keep everything

828
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,720
in a separate container so for instance

829
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,038
a rootborn pathogen doesn't cause

830
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,440
problems for everybody there are

831
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:33,960
definitely benefits to using small pot

832
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:36,600
sizes but the the the point of all this

833
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,120
is you're basically just growing if you

834
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:40,558
know how to grow and you can grow well

835
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:42,439
do that the only real difference is

836
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:44,918
you're basically just looking for

837
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,519
Expressions most of the time right like

838
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:47,919
sometimes yeah we also need a yield

839
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,798
because it's our personal medicine and

840
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,679
everybody's going to be a little bit

841
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,119
different but mostly you just need these

842
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:54,919
plants to be big enough to show them

843
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:57,479
your structure you just need them to

844
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,960
flower enough to get their profiles you

845
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,278
don't need to carry necessarily these

846
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,840
plants all the way through like you

847
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:06,638
normally would you just want to see what

848
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:08,240
they do take notes take clones and then

849
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:09,519
collect that data and use it that's

850
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,038
really the key so whatever that looks

851
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,558
like to you um I wouldn't necessarily

852
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:16,720
remmen recommend switching setups I

853
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:18,558
would do what works but yeah there are

854
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,679
benefits to certain styles of growing

855
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:22,440
and specifically certain container sizes

856
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:24,798
when pheno hunting helps keeps the keep

857
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,320
the plant small uh be able to remove

858
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,079
things and rearrange things so you can

859
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,960
take close looks things instead of you

860
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:33,240
know the one in the back corner looks

861
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,360
real good but I can't really get there

862
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,240
so there are benefits but do what works

863
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,719
for you again I'm all about recommending

864
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,399
what works for your current setup that's

865
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,240
the best answer okay and then as far as

866
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:45,278
characteristics to look for there are so

867
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,440
many different things that you can look

868
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:51,038
for right I mean anything from triome

869
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:53,200
production to structure to color the

870
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:55,359
goes on and on and on effects you know

871
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,480
after it's harvested and stuff like that

872
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:59,199
what characteristics do you look for

873
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,720
this is again largely determined by your

874
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,360
goals obviously but there's a whole list

875
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,480
of like you said the obvious ones scent

876
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:09,798
Frost coverage yield structure these are

877
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,519
things that uh we all look for and

878
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:13,638
admire and just kind of add up to things

879
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,839
we like right now if you have a very

880
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:16,158
specific Mission then you know what

881
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:17,638
you're looking for I just want that

882
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,720
profile I'm just going to hunt that

883
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:23,199
profile I may even put up with some

884
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:28,038
weakness in order to get that profile so

885
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,880
it's it's gold driven that being said

886
00:32:28,038 --> 00:32:34,079
I do like to look for certain things

887
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:36,440
ease of growth ease of growth meaning

888
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:39,439
largely to do with feeding even green

889
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,278
leaves with whatever I'm feeding it um

890
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,320
you know maybe I stress it a little bit

891
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:45,200
and it and it doesn't miss a beat ease

892
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:48,439
of growth is is a big one and how a

893
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,798
plant feeds um I want tough cultivars

894
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,360
again I don't want to say resistant but

895
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:53,679
things that hold up to

896
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:55,199
stressers I'm going to make mistakes

897
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,080
okay like we're going to have stressors

898
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,720
I don't need to introduce this or that

899
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:00,720
like we're going to have problems trust

900
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,480
me so I like to see how they hold up

901
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,600
against those problems and how well they

902
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,798
do um and then getting even more

903
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:08,398
specific I like to you know what I like

904
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:09,798
to see on a plant I don't care what I'm

905
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:12,319
hunting for I don't care if it's a

906
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:15,119
certain profile or if I want a mail or

907
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,879
whatever I want to see Botanical

908
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:20,158
compounds showing early I want to see

909
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,919
early Frost I want to see week two start

910
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,320
to see things that you don't normally

911
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:28,600
see until later in the cycle that's one

912
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:31,000
thing that's almost a sure giveaway um a

913
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:34,839
low Leaf to flower Ratio or Leaf to

914
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,119
fruit ratio that's another big one where

915
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:38,079
if I'm going to be if I'm going to have

916
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:40,278
to Manicure this thing after I harvest

917
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:43,079
it I want to be doing one or two clips

918
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:45,638
that's always super super uh attractive

919
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:48,439
to me and internal spacing inter noal

920
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:51,359
spacing does not get enough play I feel

921
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,200
like um getting the right distance

922
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,278
between the nodes and then also ones

923
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,519
that are resistant to those changing due

924
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:58,880
to the environment so maybe if you're a

925
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,159
beginner grower this will be a good tip

926
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,519
for you hotter environments will

927
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:06,360
increase your internodal spacing length

928
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,199
it stretches plants right colder

929
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:09,960
temperatures cause plants to huddle up

930
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:12,158
and stay bushy but there are certain

931
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,398
cultivars I've noticed that kind of

932
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,519
maintain their inner noal spacing

933
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:21,039
regardless that's always very attractive

934
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:23,559
to me nice big towering plants that grow

935
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:25,960
outwards in a nice canopy and a nice

936
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:28,398
inter noal spacing those are the very

937
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,639
specific things that I love to see but

938
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:33,118
largely it's going to depend on your

939
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:34,760
goals and what you're looking for um

940
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,399
it's just you never can go wrong with a

941
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,800
good structure and ease of growth and

942
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,279
things like that those are probably my

943
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,119
favorite traits to see and select for

944
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,800
how about the uh the old stem rub

945
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:45,960
technique where you're rubbing the stem

946
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,879
on your fingers and then smelling it and

947
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,320
then kind of comparing the smells do you

948
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:55,759
do that at all I'm a stem rubbing fool

949
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:57,079
Mr Grow I'm a stem sniffing mfer um stem

950
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,920
rubs are really interesting I've

951
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:00,880
actually given a lot of thought to this

952
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,880
CU we do our Q&amp;A streams for the members

953
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,599
and and sometimes they ask really good

954
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,480
questions like I'm getting this profile

955
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,640
off my stem rub can I expect it in flow

956
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,639
and and like I said I've done a lot of

957
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:13,400
stem rub in my in my day I'm not I'm no

958
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:15,799
scientist but I've sniffed a lot of

959
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,440
stems okay and I can unequivocally tell

960
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:22,240
you that sniffing the stem and seeing

961
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,960
that profile I feel like less than 50%

962
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:26,358
of the time definitely I feel like way

963
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,760
less than 50% of the time you actually

964
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:29,719
smell that smell the whole way through

965
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,920
until the

966
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:34,319
Finish usually it changes usually your

967
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,639
stem rub is going to smell a little bit

968
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,760
different than your flowers in week four

969
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:41,400
and usually your flowers in week four I

970
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,119
I I would say about half the time maybe

971
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,160
more they change until Harvest and then

972
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:46,680
you cure it and it's a little bit

973
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:48,519
different after that so I don't think

974
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:49,679
it's a great indicator of what profile

975
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:51,358
the plant is going to give out I

976
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:53,879
certainly wouldn't ever like cull a

977
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:58,039
plant because of early indicators like

978
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,960
that however I also feel like super

979
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:02,519
unscientific super Jordan River's

980
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:05,519
opinion I also feel like it's a pretty

981
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:09,280
good indication of loudness

982
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:10,880
overall so yes the the smell itself the

983
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,440
type of smell may change but if I'm

984
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,800
smelling a stinky stinky stem in in week

985
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,240
three of veg I feel like generally that

986
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,880
translate to stinky stinky flowers later

987
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:22,759
in flower just just the overall

988
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,440
powerfulness of the scent you know the

989
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,200
power of the scent I feel like it's a

990
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,800
pretty good indicator of that rarely do

991
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:31,519
I see oh the stem stinks and then it's

992
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,640
just kind of flat Tarpin in the end that

993
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,159
usually doesn't doesn't track with me

994
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:37,960
again those are super unscientific

995
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:39,719
observations but I yes I love stem rubs

996
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,800
I love stem sniffing I don't think it's

997
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:43,919
a great indicator of the way the plant

998
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,119
will smell as it matures but I do think

999
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,680
it's a pretty good indicator of if it's

1000
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:50,358
going to stink or not does that make

1001
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:51,719
sense I hope that makes sense that does

1002
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:52,960
make sense yeah I know some people are

1003
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:54,239
completely against it for kind of the

1004
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,199
reason you mentioned how like the

1005
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:57,639
profile changes throughout so that's

1006
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:59,799
that's a really good call out there now

1007
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:01,400
you mentioned stressing the plant you

1008
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,440
said you do stress although it's kind of

1009
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,838
automatically done stress kind of

1010
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,000
happens throughout the grow you don't

1011
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:09,239
really need to do anything specific but

1012
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,079
other people are doing Precision stress

1013
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:14,519
techniques while fetal hunting what type

1014
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,400
of those Precision stress techniques can

1015
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:19,639
be done in order to try to hunt through

1016
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,680
fenos typically I feel like there's two

1017
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:25,279
types of feno hunts just classified in

1018
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:27,519
my brain Jordan River categories and I

1019
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,280
feel like the first one

1020
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:32,280
is coddling pheno hunts and this is

1021
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,760
typically what I like to do which is you

1022
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,560
try to keep your plant as healthy as

1023
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,079
possible you want to have as few speed

1024
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:40,000
bumps as possible and this will show you

1025
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,599
what your plant can do at its fullest

1026
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,519
potential right it'll it'll show you

1027
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,318
what it's capable of if you grow it

1028
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:48,400
really really well and then the other

1029
00:37:46,318 --> 00:37:50,639
side of that is what I like to call the

1030
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,519
hell run and this is how a lot of people

1031
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,000
feno hunt which is like you're saying

1032
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:55,318
I'm going to underwater this plant I'm

1033
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
going to stress it I want to see the

1034
00:37:55,318 --> 00:38:00,318
ones that do well when things aren't

1035
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,800
going right that's really really

1036
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:06,159
beneficial too typically I like to do

1037
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,079
one after another ideally and like I

1038
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,000
said it it just happens if I run a plant

1039
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,519
but ideally I like to grow a plant to

1040
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,880
its fullest potential and see what it's

1041
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:16,239
capable of see that I like it see that

1042
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,039
it Wows me and then I can go back the

1043
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:20,879
second time and do some of those

1044
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:25,000
stressors the easiest ones are to expose

1045
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,400
it to high heat expose it to cold um see

1046
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,599
how it does under too little light

1047
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,240
saturated with a lot of light these are

1048
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,119
really really easy things to test

1049
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:34,799
overwatering underwatering it gets a

1050
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,318
little bit crazier when people actually

1051
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,400
introduce pests in sex or a pathogen or

1052
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:41,838
things like that PE people who do that I

1053
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,039
really do have respect for and I want to

1054
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:45,679
say specifically when I was talking

1055
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:46,880
about like testing and and and official

1056
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:49,199
testing I don't want to put down the

1057
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,559
people who are doing small controls

1058
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,879
because that's what that's the best we

1059
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,920
have those people are doing God's work

1060
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,519
sure it's not to the level of of like

1061
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,639
some University would would be able to

1062
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:00,599
to do it but I love the people who do

1063
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:02,838
introduce pests to their small scale

1064
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:04,359
grow and document the data that is

1065
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:06,440
really really cool and and very good

1066
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:08,679
work but two different types of pheno

1067
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,200
hunts both are extremely beneficial and

1068
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:13,039
and both are necessary I'd say to really

1069
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:14,679
understand a cultivar both seeing what

1070
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:17,079
it can do Under the right conditions and

1071
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:19,279
then how it responds to you know um

1072
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:20,359
non-optimal conditions those are both

1073
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,519
very important and those are the two

1074
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:24,759
types of pheno hunts so that's what I'd

1075
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:27,239
say how about training the plants I know

1076
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,160
some folks who do pheno hunts they say

1077
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,679
grow the plant naturally let's see what

1078
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:34,000
the natural structure is and then make

1079
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,759
the decision from there other folks do

1080
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,599
training on the plants you know the low

1081
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,440
stress train topping any sort of high

1082
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,280
stress training techniques whether it be

1083
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,039
you know like super cropping for example

1084
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,319
they do that now I have a feeling I know

1085
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:46,679
what your answer is going to be is do

1086
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:48,519
what you want to do as a fenal Hunter it

1087
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:50,879
really depends on what route you want to

1088
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:52,239
go in regards to it so you as a fenal

1089
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,800
Hunter what do you do do you let your

1090
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:56,199
plants grow naturally or do you do some

1091
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,880
form of training I like to do what I

1092
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:59,439
know normally do in my garden but also

1093
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,160
what I think most people do I'd like to

1094
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,800
turn this around on you Mr Grow do you

1095
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:04,480
think most people top their plants as a

1096
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,480
form of training I think a lot of people

1097
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,280
do I think a lot of new folks don't

1098
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,400
because they don't want to mess with it

1099
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,760
they don't they just want to grow the

1100
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,920
plant and let see how it is right off

1101
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,079
the bat but I think as they're a grow or

1102
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,440
two in they will because they can see

1103
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,760
what the benefits are they can you know

1104
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,679
learn how to do it see what the benefits

1105
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,720
are some people need to control height

1106
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:24,199
in their grow space so they'll top some

1107
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:26,598
some people do it in order to kind of

1108
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:28,039
help with the training make the plant WI

1109
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:30,800
have those lower branches kind of grow

1110
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:32,239
out and make a wider plant so yes for

1111
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,160
the most part I feel like new Growers

1112
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:36,598
probably just let the plant grow

1113
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,399
naturally other folks I I think a

1114
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:40,119
majority of people do do some form of

1115
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,760
training whether it be topping super

1116
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:44,880
cropping or low stress training I

1117
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,319
totally agree I think the majority are

1118
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,358
those who like you said are new and

1119
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,000
aren't training or those who are

1120
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:52,039
training and I would say of those who

1121
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,079
are topping is probably the most common

1122
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:55,838
maybe people can let me know in in chat

1123
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,880
uh shout out to the to the fimmers out

1124
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:59,920
there you know make your voices heard uh

1125
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,440
in the comments but I feel like topping

1126
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,599
is pretty common and I feel like it is a

1127
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,559
good idea to do at least one high stress

1128
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,160
training event during your feno hunt

1129
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:09,199
again everybody grows different do what

1130
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:10,799
you're going to do if you're a low

1131
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:12,519
stress training master and you want to

1132
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,640
bend her over and do all the tyeing up

1133
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:17,159
and fun stuff you do that you do you

1134
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,879
buddy but I like to see one or two high

1135
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:20,639
stress training events because sometimes

1136
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,200
plants don't respond super super well to

1137
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:24,719
that and it's good to know if your

1138
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:26,759
cultivar is one of those plants other

1139
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:28,679
ones I feel like you top them and they

1140
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,839
just like they take it as a personal

1141
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:32,598
Challenge and the next day they're just

1142
00:41:30,838 --> 00:41:35,078
exploding with growth that's another

1143
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:37,039
trait that I love to see responds well

1144
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:39,000
to topping and again I think that's

1145
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:41,920
beneficial because I I would say that

1146
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
most plant trainers top again your

1147
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,318
audience going to have to correct me if

1148
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,679
I'm wrong on that but I feel like most

1149
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:47,159
plant trainers top and that's what I

1150
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,480
love to do it's so simple to teach

1151
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:51,318
someone go in there snip here look at

1152
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,599
the nodes do it right at the top

1153
00:41:51,318 --> 00:41:56,838
multiply the branches I like a good

1154
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,519
topping man simple quick effective

1155
00:41:56,838 --> 00:42:00,039
uh but it all depends I know some I know

1156
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:02,280
some people shout out to monster scrag

1157
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:05,880
and TK Geico he's a member I know some

1158
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:08,560
people that fim and scrog a masterpiece

1159
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:11,200
plant so I could never advise against

1160
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:13,199
that but I do like to see high stress

1161
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:14,598
training like a topping during a run

1162
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:16,879
just see what the plant does when you

1163
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:19,359
cut it okay fair enough now as you're

1164
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,920
growing these plants some folks will be

1165
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:24,159
killing off plants as they go through

1166
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,440
the grow right they may see something in

1167
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:27,279
the seedling stage as early as a

1168
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,119
Seedling stage Maybe see funky grow to

1169
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,680
begin they're not going to keep that so

1170
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,000
they kill it off or in the vegetation

1171
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:34,759
stage maybe they're seeing something

1172
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,800
that they don't like with the morphology

1173
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,319
of the plant so they're killing it off

1174
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,400
are you the type that kills off plants

1175
00:42:39,318 --> 00:42:43,039
throughout the grow or you a fenal

1176
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,160
Hunter where you're letting everything

1177
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:47,838
grow no matter what it looks like all

1178
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:50,440
the way up until Harvest yeah absolutely

1179
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:51,759
I tend to call early and often I think

1180
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,760
if you're looking for a plant that

1181
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,240
checks all the boxes you have to call

1182
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,280
early and often like I said before if

1183
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:00,199
your mission dictates that you look

1184
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,640
through some of these phicure seeds then

1185
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:05,519
so be it maybe you're after that elusive

1186
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:08,159
you know lime smell uh or something you

1187
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,280
may tolerate weakness to see this plant

1188
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,679
through to see if it's the one you're

1189
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:15,599
looking for but for me I think that

1190
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:17,598
people generally are too slow to Coal I

1191
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,760
think that there's so many seeds out

1192
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,318
there you guys there's so many good

1193
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,800
genetics there's so many wonderful types

1194
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:25,279
of plants you can grow and if this thing

1195
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,119
is if this thing is giving you any

1196
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,519
trouble

1197
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,800
my recommendation would be to co earlier

1198
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:35,400
Co more often and send more we have a

1199
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,720
lot to look through and um like I said I

1200
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,760
think people are generally a little too

1201
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:40,159
afraid to call too early if you're

1202
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,119
looking for a plant that checks all the

1203
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,759
boxes you should be calling basically

1204
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,480
from beginning to end on the flip side

1205
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,720
of that you really can't tell how a

1206
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,119
plant is going to express until it's all

1207
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:53,118
the way done one of my members asked me

1208
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,599
a a a new type question that's like such

1209
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,079
a good question which is how can you

1210
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,160
tell when a plant's like final profile

1211
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,240
is there what at what stage can you tell

1212
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:05,358
what a plant's final profile I said

1213
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:07,799
Harvest cure four weeks into cure maybe

1214
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:10,318
um you have to keep it around to really

1215
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,400
see what it's going to do but if again

1216
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:13,000
if you're looking for something that's

1217
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,358
going to be the one and it's going to

1218
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,679
check all the boxes start culling early

1219
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:18,799
and start culling often the only

1220
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:20,919
exception to that is if you're looking

1221
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,160
for a specific medicinal effect or a

1222
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,280
specific profile that you're willing to

1223
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:27,920
put up with some finickiness to get

1224
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,319
there that would be my answer okay and

1225
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,200
then at what point do you select the

1226
00:44:29,318 --> 00:44:34,199
keeper feno do you select just one or

1227
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:35,719
has there ever been a time where you had

1228
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:38,480
to select multiple Keepers because you

1229
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:40,598
just you liked more than one oh man

1230
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,880
always always so I think there's like a

1231
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:44,160
few ways to do this some people find a

1232
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,640
strain that works for them and they have

1233
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,960
their keeper and then they start working

1234
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:50,159
it they they'll they'll find their

1235
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,318
cultivar and they'll make more seeds

1236
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:54,799
they'll work the generations further

1237
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:57,239
they'll do stuff like that um other

1238
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,359
people keep kind of aate a I'm one of

1239
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:00,639
those people I think this is probably

1240
00:44:58,358 --> 00:45:02,838
the most common uh when it comes to

1241
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:04,358
cultivators and home cultivators where

1242
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:06,920
they they get a list of Keepers and they

1243
00:45:04,358 --> 00:45:08,960
keep a handful around and then what'll

1244
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,318
happen is sometimes a new one will pop

1245
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,159
up that's better than one in your stable

1246
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:16,880
and you'll kind of swap that out so for

1247
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:18,799
me 2023 I had a handful of Keepers man

1248
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,440
um some rise of Rich work that was

1249
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,440
incredible some purple Caper work that

1250
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,079
was really really good another that a

1251
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,400
member made um a peach Dosey by guy

1252
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,680
named Old Bay there's just some really

1253
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,318
really good keepers and that's kind of

1254
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:34,239
created my stable once you're at that

1255
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:37,318
stage I really recommend you share the

1256
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:39,239
love and spread cuting around you want

1257
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:41,159
to either make seeds or spread cuting

1258
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:44,000
around because the last thing you want

1259
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:46,000
to do is hunt for years and years and

1260
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,800
years and find your unicorn and find the

1261
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
one that that helps you you know helps

1262
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:52,559
your Crohns or helps your migraines and

1263
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,599
this is the one and then it dies in your

1264
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:56,760
garden and it's gone forever you cannot

1265
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:58,838
let that happen that is is like the only

1266
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:01,280
scenario that's like a failure in this

1267
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:03,000
whole botony of Desire feno hunt thing

1268
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,280
and the way that you remedy that is by

1269
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,480
backing up those genetics the easiest

1270
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,319
way is to just give it to your buddies

1271
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:12,719
there are like a tissue culture ways to

1272
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:14,000
like store stuff that's really cool but

1273
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:15,919
the easiest way to do is just pass the

1274
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,440
cuts around man share the love share the

1275
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,318
love see if it helps other people with

1276
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,838
your same ailment we're all biologically

1277
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:25,199
different maybe you got the real Panacea

1278
00:46:22,838 --> 00:46:26,759
cut we don't want to lose that to a

1279
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:29,679
power outage we don't want to lose that

1280
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:32,960
to a soil born pathogen so spread that

1281
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:36,039
love um but yeah for me it's like I keep

1282
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,318
a stable of Keepers some people keep no

1283
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:39,279
cuts and they just want to look through

1284
00:46:37,318 --> 00:46:41,079
as many seeds as they can and and PAW

1285
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,200
through the library and see as much as

1286
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:45,039
possible I think that's a beautiful

1287
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:46,838
mission in itself but for me I'm hunting

1288
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:48,279
for something so I can keep it I'm going

1289
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:50,358
to keep a handful of things because I

1290
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:52,440
like variety and I'm going to spread

1291
00:46:50,358 --> 00:46:53,719
those cuting around so I don't lose them

1292
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,039
you know there's several grommies who

1293
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:56,558
are holding on to those cuts so I don't

1294
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:58,279
got to worry when I'm out here in the

1295
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:00,160
islands that I'm going to lose all that

1296
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,880
hard work so that's what I recommend is

1297
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:05,480
do that hunt get your keeper get your

1298
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,240
stable and then spread the love give

1299
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,280
those cuting out it'll be the smartest

1300
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:10,479
thing you you will ever have done when

1301
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,640
uh something goes wrong in your garden

1302
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,199
trust me yeah losing Pho the the the

1303
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:18,318
feeling of heartbreak that happens once

1304
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:20,879
you lose that feno that you just love so

1305
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:24,119
much and I spent so many years just

1306
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,800
popping seeds growing plants out finding

1307
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:27,800
really good ones and then not like

1308
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,079
monster cropping like at least you can

1309
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,440
bring it back right so even if the

1310
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,680
plant's in the flowering stage towards

1311
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,639
the end of flowering you can cut off a

1312
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:37,919
limb and put it right into soil and

1313
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:40,239
it'll root again right and you can keep

1314
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,240
those genetics around I made the mistake

1315
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:46,199
of not keeping a handful of of good

1316
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:48,399
fenos around what was it I hear a

1317
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:51,239
personal story here man tell tell me the

1318
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:54,880
top regret I got to hear it Queen an's

1319
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:57,439
Revenge by TGA genetics well formerly it

1320
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,000
was TGA genetics back when I grew it and

1321
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,679
I went to subcool seeds I think Miss

1322
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,318
Jill took it over I had a beautiful plan

1323
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:04,719
I talk about it so much on my channel

1324
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:07,318
that uh people are probably sick of

1325
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:09,279
hearing the story behind it but but it

1326
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:12,558
was just just beautiful plant easy

1327
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:15,000
feeder it had covered in tricomes from

1328
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,720
top to bottom the lower buds were super

1329
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,679
dense there was like no L on it

1330
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:20,159
whatsoever towards the end of flowering

1331
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:22,440
the purpling that happened it was like a

1332
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:24,799
dark dark purple that started at the top

1333
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,679
slowly worked its way down the Plant as

1334
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,119
the days went on and then I ended up

1335
00:48:26,679 --> 00:48:31,519
doing a partial Harvest on it so like I

1336
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:34,200
harvested the top branches and uncovered

1337
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,838
some of the other leaves which weren't

1338
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:38,439
exposed to the light and they were like

1339
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:39,599
a so like a green color and the purple

1340
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,880
with the green it kind of looked like

1341
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:44,519
more like a neon green it just looked

1342
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:47,400
amazing and then lastly the effects the

1343
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:49,960
effects on that were just incredible

1344
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:52,160
narcotic effect I ended up picking up a

1345
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,838
uh a 10 pack of Queens in Revenge 6

1346
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:55,239
months ago and I grew out some more

1347
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:57,719
plants just cuz I'm I'm looking for that

1348
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:59,759
feed again I Circle back around I

1349
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:03,558
haven't found it yet find anything close

1350
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:06,240
no not yet not yet so I'm going to keep

1351
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:08,798
keep hunting for it because uh I need to

1352
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:10,279
find that I need to find it it's it's

1353
00:49:08,798 --> 00:49:12,280
there's so many heartbreaking stories

1354
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,480
like that and like you said it's it's uh

1355
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:16,400
it's surprising how much of a reaction

1356
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,318
you'll have like it's a really sad event

1357
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,838
it's like that thing's gone forever it

1358
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:22,400
bums you out like you said I had a Cura

1359
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:24,960
Kush by cultivated choice that was just

1360
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,519
straight coffee beans just face full of

1361
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,920
coffeee beans I love coffee and that's

1362
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:32,318
probably one of my biggest you know sad

1363
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,920
moments is losing that one but but shout

1364

1367
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:41,879
that you found that cultivar and it was

1368
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,480
so amazing yeah so hopefully I can find

1369
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,920
it again and uh yeah again monster crop

1370
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,679
I actually found a u Icarus Wings by

1371
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:52,079
Prism Labs beautiful plant and I had in

1372
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:54,039
flowering and I'm like I need to keep

1373
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,440
this one I have more seeds but like I

1374
00:49:54,039 --> 00:49:58,159
want this one so went ahead and monster

1375
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,358
cropped it and so I'm keeping that

1376
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:01,279
around and I'll probably use it for a

1377
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:04,078
breeding project because I'm just so

1378
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,240
excited about it you got to man anyways

1379
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,880
back on topic we're coming up towards

1380
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:10,358
the end here I do want to ask you if you

1381
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,599
have any other tips on how to conduct a

1382
00:50:10,358 --> 00:50:15,400
successful and efficient fenal hunt yeah

1383
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:17,280
absolutely um Don't Be Afraid get

1384
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,039
started get started now don't let anyone

1385
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,359
put you down or tell you you can't do it

1386
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:21,759
or that you're not a breeder you're not

1387
00:50:20,358 --> 00:50:24,078
this or you're not that that's the first

1388
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,680
most important thing um and then what

1389
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:29,160
you just said basically stay organized

1390
00:50:26,679 --> 00:50:30,798
and stay on top of things and take notes

1391
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:33,039
you should have cuttings of everything

1392
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:35,000
you're hunting even if it means taking

1393
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:36,599
and reving something you're going to

1394
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,519
you're going to try one five weeks into

1395
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:40,519
cure and go holy crap I should have

1396
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:42,798
taken that cut that's the last thing you

1397
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:45,079
want to do so take cuting of everything

1398
00:50:42,798 --> 00:50:48,318
back up everything share everything and

1399
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:51,798
most importantly take notes data is so

1400
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:55,679
important your brain will trick you your

1401
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:57,719
brain will let Nostalgia and emotions

1402
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:58,679
come into it so find out what works for

1403
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:00,719
you whether that's doing it

1404
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:02,239
electronically so you can go through and

1405
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:04,159
contr left and search through things and

1406
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:07,439
scroll scroll scroll or doing it old

1407
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:09,159
school get the the Whiteboard up on the

1408
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,119
growroom wall so you can take all of

1409
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:12,798
your extensive notes and then maybe snap

1410
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,480
a picture of it before you start over

1411
00:51:12,798 --> 00:51:18,480
old school you know pen and paper find

1412
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:20,760
what works for you and take extensive

1413
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,599
notes that's really the only big

1414
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:26,280
difference between doing a grow and

1415
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:28,559
doing a fenoon is just popping a lot of

1416
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,280
something or a lot of different things

1417
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,119
taking notes on everything and taking

1418
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:35,200
cuting so you can run them again later

1419
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:37,318
it's basically the same thing um so that

1420
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:39,480
that is my advice do it for yourself

1421
00:51:37,318 --> 00:51:41,400
your own palette makes you unique

1422
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,159
there's no one else with your tastes

1423
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,880
that is why your selections are going to

1424
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:48,199
be unique um so yeah just don't let

1425
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:50,000
anyone put down you or the your work or

1426
00:51:48,199 --> 00:51:52,519
what you plan on accomplishing get a

1427
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,400
mission in mind and and head towards it

1428
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:57,318
and remember that at the end of the day

1429
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,838
we're all just willing victims of the

1430

1475
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:33,920
follow growcast to stay tuned awesome I

1476
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,880
forgot you had those chillo G's yeah if

1477
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,240
you end up growing them out there I I'm

1478
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,680
really interested to see what you get

1479
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:41,358
for a result because we're in completely

1480
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:43,519
different climate like I'm in the desert

1481
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:45,119
you know what I mean it's very dry here

1482
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:46,480
and I mean I'm growing indoors and I'm

1483
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:50,280
controlling my environment stuff like

1484
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:51,880
that but different genetics can react

1485
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,920
differently right different morphology

1486
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,519
different expression in different areas

1487
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,000
so somebody could grow and they could be

1488
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:59,400
like this is hot trash in one area other

1489
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,719
area they're like this is fire you know

1490
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,280
what I mean so I'm interested to hear

1491
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:05,199
how it how it works out for you in your

1492
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:07,359
area it's it's the opposite environment

1493
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:09,798
and Malachi Kevin said that OG's do okay

1494
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:11,598
out here OG's when I used to grow sfv it

1495
00:54:09,798 --> 00:54:13,239
was a little bit finicky but it never

1496
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,119
got powdery mil do and he said they do

1497
00:54:13,239 --> 00:54:16,879
okay out here so we'll be rooting for

1498
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,680
the chill out OG to be a front runner in

I have other people who have talked

1505
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:31,039
about fenal hunting on this podcast if

1506
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:32,358
you dig back on some of the episodes

1507
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:34,318
you'll see but there's definitely

1508
00:54:32,358 --> 00:54:35,920
different opinions different ways to go

1509
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:37,639
about it so if you are interested in

1510
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,079

1511
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:41,039
definitely tune in to those other

1512
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:43,000
episodes and if you do leave those

1513
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:44,599
questions in the comment section I could

1514
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,920
potentially use them for future episodes

1515
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:46,680
because I might have missed something

1516
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,599
might have been something that

1517
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:50,679

1521
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,200
