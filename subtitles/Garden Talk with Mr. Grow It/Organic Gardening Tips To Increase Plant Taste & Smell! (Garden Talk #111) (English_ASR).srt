00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,199
gardening and how they do things in

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,440
their Garden what's up everybody if you

7
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:18,000
that don't know me my name is Chris aka

00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:41,920
botney and enzymology in this episode

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,039
she talks about organic gardening

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,198
methods that she does in order to help

21
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,920
improve the taste and smell of the final

talk clips on YouTube that is a channel

25
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,960
dedicated to short clips of these

26
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,840
podcast episodes one of my goals of this

27
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,759
podcast is to bring free information

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,039
about gardening to the general public

29
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,920
that that being said I'd like to thank

30
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,960
the sponsors of today's episode who

31
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,478
helped make that goal possible thanks to

Infinity I have their inline fan ducting

35
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:17,640
carbon filter and their controller I

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,560
love the controller 69 Pro with

37
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,118
temperature humidity and VPD programming

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,719
and having control of different fan

39
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:26,478
speeds this makes it so much easier to

40
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,319
control my grow environment their

41
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:31,959
controller 69 pro version also controls

42
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:35,199

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,040
using stash blend for over a year now

47
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,118
and it's awesome one of the things that

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,600
I really like is that it saves me money

49
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,280
it's a whole bunch of different inputs

50
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,919
in one so I no longer have to go out

51
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,920
there and buy a silica bottle then a

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,118
separate seaweed bottle beneficial

53
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,920
bacteria then a separate one for microle

00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:10,079
section below and we are back welcome to

59
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,000
the Garden Talk podcast today I am

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,959
joined with Luna whip how you doing

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,400
today pretty good thanks for having me

62
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,878
on and thanks for coming on so I

63
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,800
initially came across you through the

64
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,639
FCP Channel and I I think you've been on

65
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,439
there multiple times and I mean if you

66
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,359
just search your name into YouTube

67
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:30,560
there's several different talks and you

68
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,599
have a lot of knowledge when it comes to

69
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,560
gardening more on the advanced side of

70
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:36,679
things which really piqu my interest

71
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,479
because we do have uh quite a bit of

72
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,599
advanced folks here that tune in to this

73
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,439
podcast and I know you're all into the

74
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:44,878
organic side of things that's really

75
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,560
what I want to get into today is kind of

76
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,719
organic gardening and I know a lot of

77
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,800
folks their goal is really to bring out

78
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,959
a good taste and smell in the final

79
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,400
product so kind of utilizing these

80
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,000
methods and kind of how we go here if

81
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,480
you have any tips along those lines

82
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,318
please feel free to mention them because

83
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,479
that is certainly an end goal for a lot

84
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,158
of folks but before we get into the

85
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:06,878
questions can you just give us a little

86
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:08,519
bit of background about yourself kind of

87
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,158
tell us how you got into gardening and

88
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,719
stuff like that yeah sure uh so my name

89
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:17,399
is Luna Wickham I specialize in Agronomy

90
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:19,840
soil biology microscopy enology um I do

91
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,920
a lot of work on building soil and

92
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,239
making nutrients available in soil

93
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:27,839
through balancing nutrients through the

94
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:30,080
soil mineral balancing Theory as well as

95
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,719
making them available with mimicking

96
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,879
root exit dates adding amino acids

97
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,199
enzymes

98
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:39,719
carbohydrates uh and processes that

99
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:41,639
promote biology consume nutrients cycle

100
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,560
them through their different processes

101
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:47,479
and make them available to plants to

102
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,319
promote Health Vigor flavor and Aroma I

103
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:51,280
originally got into gardening um through

104
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:53,719
growing medicinal plants I started

105
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,519
cultivating in 2009 I've been

106
00:03:53,719 --> 00:04:00,039
cultivating for 15 years um doing

107
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:04,000
outdoor living soil outdoor organic

108
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:05,679
cultivation um growing in ground using a

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,799
lot of teas a lot of different

110
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,200
inoculants a lot of compost um and

111
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,438
really forming an alliance with nature

112
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,719
to promote you know healthy vigorous

113
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:19,358
medicine like to to grow real medicine

114
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,840
that's therapeutic flavorful enjoyable

115
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,839
for people um did this in Northern

116
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:27,079
California I've also done it in southern

117
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:30,119
Oregon I have experience doing

118
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:34,000
consulting on hemp farms and growing in

119
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,160
green houses indoor outdoor um using

120
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,120
synthetic nutrients also using organic

121
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,280
nutrients I kind of just touched on all

122
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,918
of that good stuff there so I'm GNA ask

123
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,038
you a controversial question right off

124
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:49,120
the bat and uh do it I

125
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:51,399
like many Growers claim that growing

126
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,319
with Organic inputs and utilizing

127
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:55,359
microbiology results in the plants

128
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:58,279
producing a better taste and smell they

129
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,120
swear by it they say hey organic way

130
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:03,319
better than anything bottle grown what's

131
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,959
your take on that I subscribe to that

132
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:08,120
ideology also I've done hydroponic

133
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:11,239
cultivation for many years um I've also

134
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,800
done living soil and organic cultivation

135
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,079
from my understanding of how it kind of

136
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,478
results in better flavor and Aroma is

137
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:20,800
that each of these compounds that

138
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,639
produce flavonoids they produce Aroma

139
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,280
they produce you know the different

140
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,720
diversities of smell they all require a

141
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,959
complex chain of compounds prior to

142
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,080
their formation to be able to be

143
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:36,959
expressed genetically expressed in a

144
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:38,758
plant so if you're lacking any piece in

145
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,198
the chain that's required to

146
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,680
biosynthesize these compounds they

147
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,038
simply just won't synthesize so in a

148
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,759
hydroponic growing environment we have a

149
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:53,879
very we have a much more narrow profile

150
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,520
of nutrients and compounds we have our

151
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:59,240
major ones you know that you hear of the

152
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:01,599
NPK the calcium the Magnesium um but

153
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,079
when it comes down to different forms of

154
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,879
nitrogen different forms of phosphorus

155
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,038
different forms of calcium living soil

156
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,240
has a much broader diversity of these

157
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:13,519
compounds while also including a

158
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,560
diversity of amino acids A diversity of

159
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:19,439
enzymes A diversity of organic acids and

160
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,120
these compounds all have uh they create

161
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,918
unique physiological responses in plants

162
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,038
and they produce different genetic

163
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:29,000
Expressions so when you have a larger

164
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,879
diversity of these compounds it allows

165
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,639
the plant to biosynthesize different

166
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:36,120
flavonoids and and you know volatile

167
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,038
organic compounds the things that

168
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:43,598
produce Aroma like Esters phenols thols

169
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:46,680
which produce a different profile a more

170
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:48,839
depth profile of Aroma and I believe

171
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,160
that that's more achievable and more

172
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,119
likely to be achievable in a living soil

173
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,560
setting in an organic setting than in a

174
00:06:53,120 --> 00:07:00,038
hydroponic setting however that's going

175
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,959
to be based on user un like the user

176
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:04,000
success so just because you're growing

177
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:05,560
an organic doesn't necessarily mean

178
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,639
you're going to end up with a better

179
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,199
product um and a lot of the times it's

180
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,680
more difficult for people to grow in

181
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,800
organic settings because it can be a

182
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,120
little bit more complicated um and you

183
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,000
may not result uh have an end result

184
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,160
that is you know more flavorful has more

185
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,160
Aroma more aromatic so I think that it's

186
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,439
potentially possible that you can have

187
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,319
more flavor more smell um but it doesn't

188
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,680
necessarily mean that you well

189
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,360
understood that's a really good way to

190
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,319
break it down and I think you've

191
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,120
revealed some information here that

192
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,639
hasn't been revealed on any of the past

193
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,000
episodes now one of the things a

194
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,519
follow-up question to this is uh and I

195
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,158
know we're going to get into microbes

196
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:50,079
here in a little bit but uh this relates

197
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:52,719
to microbes is what is their impact to

198
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:55,519
the taste and smell that the plants

199
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,919
Express so microbes during their

200
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:00,279
processes of decomposing organic matter

201
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:02,719
they secrete enzymes that are key

202
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:06,079
components and building blocks um or key

203
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,120
components to processes that provide the

204
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:11,519
diversity of organic compounds needed by

205
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,399
plants to produce different flavonoids

206
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,719
and Aromas they also they secrete um

207
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:18,598
they secrete enzymes they secrete

208
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,639
carbohydrates they break down organic

209
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:24,360
matter but they also convert particular

210
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,360
organic acids into other organic acids

211
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,759
they can also break certain organic

212
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,960
acids down um so they're no longer

213
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,719
viable are no longer useful by the plant

214
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,759
but they can also stabilize organic

215
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,360
acids and like I mentioned earlier they

216
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:42,038
organic acids have specific plant

217
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,158
physiologic stimulating effects so

218
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:46,120
microbes with their interaction with the

219
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:50,399
soil and the diversity of compounds in

220
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:52,879
the soil the nutrients the um organic

221
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,639
acids like I had said and the different

222
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,320
the broad profile of these different

223
00:08:54,639 --> 00:09:00,600
things that exist inside of the soil

224
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,800
their their role changes the composition

225
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,720
of these things and allows for a wider

226
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:08,199
diversity

227
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,879
so on top of that also microbes can be

228
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,079
what's called endic and what that means

229
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:16,480
is they can exist inside the cell of the

230
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:19,439
plant and inside the cell of the plant

231
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,200
they also do these processes but an

232
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,440
important part of this P like an

233
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,040
important piece of this puzzle is that

234
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:30,880
they also can create phyto hormones so

235
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:33,958
phyto hormones they trigger specific

236
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:36,759
actions in the plant they can trigger um

237
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,838
like P pest defense stress responses

238
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:42,159
they can promote different flowering

239
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:44,519
stages they can Pro promote you know

240
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:47,319
node elongation you know bud swelling

241
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:50,480
and stuff like that they're made by the

242
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,760
plant but they you like the plant and

243
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,720
the microb work together to create these

244
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,958
compounds they can be created in the

245
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,800
soil they can also be created in the

246
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,958
cell of the plant so we have our our

247
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,679
decomposing microbes that do what I had

248
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,838
mentioned but we also have our endic

249
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,838
microbes which can exist inside the cell

250
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,320
of the plant and produce these phyto

251
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,519
hormones directly at the cell to

252
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,320
stimulate the plant to do these

253
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:16,839
different processes and produce more

254
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,920
Aroma more

255
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,760
flavor resulting in a better product

256
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,838
incredible yeah Endo fights is something

257
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,838
that uh I picked up learned from Jeff

258
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,800
lenells so shout out to him I had him on

259
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,000
the podcast in the past he did a really

260
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,120
good breakdown of endo fights and their

261
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
role and he was so excited about it it

262
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,278
was incredible I I say a newer thing

263
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,759
that's kind of been learned over the

264
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:40,159
past you know 5 10 years or so it seems

265
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,879
like there's more Focus talking about

266
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,600
end fights versus just the soil microb

267
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,480
and really uncovering more things that

268
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,040
we're learning about Endo fights and how

269
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,680
it impacts the plant so really cool that

270
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:53,159
you had mentioned that here they're

271
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:55,439
extremely fascinating yeah and talking

272
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:57,240
about the other microbes particularly

273
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,720
the ones in the soil you did a really

274
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,680
good breakdown on another top I had

275
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,759
tuned in of yours talking about you know

276
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,479
bacteria and fungi and ARA can you give

277
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:08,399
us kind of like layman's terms or just

278
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,240
kind of the basics of those microbes

279
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,839
kind of information Growers should know

280
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,839
to help improve plant health and growth

281
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,760
sure so um what it sounds like you

282
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,120
referring to is like the soil food web

283
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,720
and we have like our lower bacteria

284
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,839
right which is you know kind of just

285
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,600
what you think of when you think of

286
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,920
bacteria we also have like our protozoa

287
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,079
which are which are kind of just like

288
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:32,078
the the Predators within the the soil

289
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:34,638
World um protozoa actually means early

290
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:38,239
animal or first animal they're

291
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:40,560
supposedly the first step in evolution

292
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,120
between bacteria and animal and what

293
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,199
they do is they run around they swim

294
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,639
around they little wiggle around and

295
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,079
stuff um and they consume the lower

296
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,919
bacteria so the lower bacteria consumes

297
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,958
organic matter um that possesses forms

298
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:57,958
of nutrients and then the protozoa will

299
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,479
come around and consume that bacteria

300
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,759
and unlock those nutrient nutrients they

301
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,000
change it from one form to another like

302
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,360
I had mentioned earlier just kind of

303
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,919
touched on it there are different forms

304
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,200
of these nutrients with different forms

305
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:11,078
of nitrogen there's different forms of

306
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,120
phosphorus and what this biology is

307
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:15,958
doing when it's consuming lower bacteria

308
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,759
is it's changing it from one cycle to

309
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:20,679
another and you hear this as the

310
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:25,198
nitrogen cycle or the phosphorus

311
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:27,198
cycle um there's also nematodes

312
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:29,159
nematodes are like tiny little little

313
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:30,838
worms they serve a whole bunch of

314
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:32,838
different functions there's predatory

315
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,360
nematodes um there's a lot of different

316
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,240
species of nematodes but a lot of the

317
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,879
time they consume bacteria they can also

318
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,919
consume fungus and in this process

319
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:44,720
they're breaking down and releasing

320
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:47,039
nutrients from bacteria but also

321
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,720
converting things like polysaccharides

322
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:52,039
into um simple sugars so they're taking

323
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,320
complex sugars they're turning them into

324
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:56,439
simple sugars um and they're allowing

325
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,680
for other biology to consume it and feed

326
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,000
on it's all just like this big cycle

327
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,759
right right and then we also have you

328
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,198
know

329
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,480
um amibas and ARA and stuff like that

330
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:10,719
and they all kind of serve similar

331
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,000
functions as protozoa there's felet

332
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,959
they're within the protozoa

333
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,159
family um but further on like in the

334
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,399
soil food web we have like

335
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:22,039
microarthropods right which are tiny

336
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:24,039
tiny insects like mites and mites can

337
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:26,559
actually consume forms of protozoa they

338
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:28,838
also break down in Trad organic matter

339
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,239
and their excrement um is full of

340
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,519
nutrients for the plant as well so all

341
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,600
of these components are required to

342
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,759
really have like a healthy living

343
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,360
organic soil that's full of cycling

344
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,759
nutrients and a diversity of compounds

345
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,120
that promote that flavor and that give

346
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:47,240
give people the the outcome that they're

347
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,278
looking for with living soil and organic

348
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,959
cultivation we can tailor different

349
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:55,399
fermentations whether they're aerobic

350
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,518
with oxygen um multiplied with oxygen or

351
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,919
anerobic multiplied without oxygen we

352
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,839
can tailor different mentations to

353
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,078
introduce specific forms of these

354
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,639
biology we can also tailor them by

355
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:09,719
adding different food sources to our

356
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:13,240
fermentations different different

357
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,800
species of bacteria they they prefer

358
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,560
different food sources which is why

359
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,758
there's different types of like agar

360
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,319
plates and stuff like that right um so

361
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,720
we can actually tailor our fermentations

362
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,480
through different food sources through

363
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,000
different polysaccharides as well as

364
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,399
different enzymes and amino acids to

365
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,480
promote diversity Within in like our

366
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,159
fermentations and introduce them to the

367
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,199
soil that's kind of more complicated and

368
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,319
requires a little bit of understanding

369
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:39,879
but it's a really really fascinating

370
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,720
aspect of living soil that I think

371
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:44,799
people shouldn't

372
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,839
ignore and it's also really a lot of fun

373
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,679
so you hear about people talking about

374
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,040
um lactic acid bacteria serum or

375
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:55,679
fermenting you know making activated um

376
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:57,639
effective microorganisms or um ired

377
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:00,039
compost tees and things like that that's

378
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,879
that's kind of the the the foundation of

379
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:04,319
it but you can take it a little bit

380
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:07,720
further when you understand how biology

381
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,639
works and what it requires to multiply

382
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,519
then you can you can promote the

383
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:13,799
multiplication of very specific species

384
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,959
of biology especially if you're using

385
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:20,319
inoculants like a source inoculant for

386
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:22,719
example there's um you know phosphorus

387
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,320
solubilizing microbes right you can

388
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,720
introduce phosphorous solubilizing

389
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,759
microbes the food source they prefer as

390
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,879
well as the enzymes that they secrete to

391
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:32,519
kind of give them the home and the

392
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:36,399
stimulation they require

393
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:38,959
um to thrive and multiply

394
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,120
them and I think that that's like that's

395
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,958
kind of like the next level like

396
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,440
advanced stuff that people can get into

397
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,159
um that really takes someone from

398
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,720
struggling with living soil and organic

399
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:52,120
cultivation to like really taking full

400
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,000
advantage of it and seeing like it's

401
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,839
real potential which can be intimidating

402
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,360
but in the end the juice is definitely

403
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:00,279
worth a squeeze and I highly encourage

404
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:04,199
people to dive down those rabbit holes

405
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:06,120
and learn about microbes and biology to

406
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:08,078
you know level up their game that's

407
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,360
interesting yeah I think a lot of people

408
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,599
use microbial inoculant um you know

409
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,560
they're buying it off the shelf whether

410
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,159
it be like a mammoth P or tribus or

411
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,599
there's a ton of different microbi

412
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,360
inoculant products on the market today

413
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,959
and uh you know they're using those

414
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,639
they're adding them in and then of

415
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:26,119
course it's they're doing their jobs in

416
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:28,079
the soil there do you use any microbial

417
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,480
inoculant or you kind of doing like the

418
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,120
Imo natural farming process IMO for

419
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,079
those that don't know it's indigenous

420
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,959
microorganisms there's basically a

421
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,359
process that's done where you can get

422
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:40,000
microbes naturally from your native soil

423
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,039
for example can you talk to us about

424
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,240
kind of microbial inoculant like ones

425
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:47,679
that you use or maybe the IMO process if

426
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:51,240
you do that sure um so I actually don't

427
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:53,359
use the IML process I have um particular

428
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,318
opinions about it um and we can get into

429
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,560
that too but to first answer your

430
00:16:55,318 --> 00:17:01,958
original question I will use some microb

431
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:05,000
ulence specifically if I'm after a

432
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:07,879
particular end of Fight right so a lot

433
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,919
of these bottle inoculants they have you

434
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:13,079
know basilla species that are pretty

435
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:16,120
common um and exist kind of ubiquitously

436
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:17,838
in nature um and you can really harness

437
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:21,198
them just with high quality earthworm

438
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:25,480
castings and insect frass so I like to

439
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:28,199
just source that my inoculant source is

440
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,679
earthworm castings and insect Fass which

441
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,320
is my preferred method of

442
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:36,280
inoculant because insects they do what's

443
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:37,720
called mesophilic composting where they

444
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:41,000
take organic matter and they break it

445
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,240
down mesophilic which is like uh medium

446
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,519
temperature which so they have we have

447
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,120
mesophilic we have thermophilic

448
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:47,798
thermophilic would be like traditional

449
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:50,038
composting where you're turning and it's

450
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:51,879
getting really hot um that heat can

451
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:54,279
limit diversity of microbes it also

452
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,640
produces CO2 not in any excessive amount

453
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:57,519
that it's you know really damaging to

454
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,640
the environment but potentially it can

455
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:05,200
be and and I prefer to not put the labor

456
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:08,440
in to turn compost piles but to use

457
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:12,440
insects kind of as my allies to break

458
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:14,759
down organic matter faster in my opinion

459
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,200
with less labor and produce a wider

460
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:19,200
diversity of biology that I can

461
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:22,600
introduce as my microbial inoculate so

462
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,200
if I am after very specific species of

463
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:27,359
of biology of microbes like um you know

464
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,000
the phosphorous solubilizing bacteria

465
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,599
that I had mentioned earlier I'll pick

466
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,759
up a product like Mammoth P I'll also

467
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:37,000
you know find all Source enzymes that

468
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:39,000
are secret secreted by those specific

469
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,640
bacteria you can buy them online with

470
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,359
different websites um introduce them to

471
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,679
like a fermentation find the specific

472
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:49,240
food source that they prefer introduce

473
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,000
that as as well and let them multiply so

474
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,359
that I'm not limited to the very small

475
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,558
amount that I've purchased and I like to

476
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,678
do that with a bunch of different

477
00:18:54,558 --> 00:19:01,599
biology um it sounds kind of

478
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:04,519
intimidating it's really not but um when

479
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:06,359
I do use bottled inoculants I'll find

480
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:09,200
specific bottled inoculants that have

481
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:12,719
specific endites so another one is uh

482
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,038
rotos sudon rotos sudam monus palestras

483
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,839
which is a photosynthetic Endy that you

484
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:18,839
can find in a product like uh

485
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:21,000
photosynthetic Plus or I'm sorry

486
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:22,759
photosynthesis plus which is a microbl

487
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,159
product so those are the two that I

488
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:28,519
really use um I'll use micro um

489
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:31,400
photosynthesis plus and I'll also use

490
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:34,519
Mammoth P cuzz those have very

491
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,400
particular bacteria that I want um

492
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:40,679
another one would be like nitrogen um

493
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,840
solubilizing and fixing bacteria so

494
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,240
those are like the big ones that I'll

495
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:46,639
use those are the big inoculant that

496
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,240
I'll go after but other than that I use

497
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,038
earthworm castings and insect frass as

498
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,480
my go-to for my inoculant for my soil

499
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:56,319
earthworm castings in Tech fast I love

500
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,079
those two inputs really really good I

501
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,798
use them in just about every grow as

502
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,519
well well let's get into inputs actually

503
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:04,359
let's first get into initial soil mix

504
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:06,558
right so what is your kind of

505
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:08,038
recommended soil mix to begin a lot of

506
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:11,119
people are going after the the one to

507
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:12,919
one: one clamus cot is kind of made that

508
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,359
famous although he got that from

509
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:16,360
University I forget which university you

510
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:19,678
got it from but one part where it's

511
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:22,759
either Pete or cocoa one part Iration

512
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,919
and then uh one part of compost to worm

513
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,240
casting and then some people add

514
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,919
fertilizer on it as well but what's your

515
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,440
recommended soil mix so I love coup um

516
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,440
I've actually done podcasts with him

517
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:38,240
before um I don't follow that heavy of

518
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,558
an organic matter mix I'll max out my

519
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,440
organic matter at about 20% but I've

520
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:46,079
seen great results with organic matter

521
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:48,038
as low as 5% um 20% from a study that

522
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:50,119
I've seen recently released by uh

523
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:52,400
Cornell University is kind of the

524
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:54,719
maximum that that Cornell has

525
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,280
recommended in recent years and I know

526
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,159
that that c is you know a very

527
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:01,119
knowledgeable person um

528
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:03,440
but I think that that study was from a

529
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:05,879
while ago he released that CP mix um

530
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,038
quite some time ago now and it's a very

531
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,880
it's like probably the most well-known

532
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:13,400
living soil organic mix out there is the

533
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,320
the cot mix cuz he was one of the first

534
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,720
people to just release it I've used it

535
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:21,200
before it's not my favorite in terms of

536
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,079
like what's my favorite mix if I told

537
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,960
you you wouldn't know the name of it so

538
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:29,480
like no one would know what it is but um

539
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:33,120
what I do is I follow a system called

540
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,919
the alre soil mineral balancing Theory

541
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:39,839
and I encourage everyone to look this up

542
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,960
and it has different ratios of nutrients

543
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,599
um that are applicable to different soil

544
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,679
compositions and one of them being um

545
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:49,759
like Rich potting soil that's mixed you

546
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:52,640
know with Pete or cocoa um and it has

547
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:54,798
different different ratios for NPK so on

548
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,559
through your your trace minerals your

549
00:21:54,798 --> 00:22:01,038
micros um and that's what I like to

550
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:04,359
follow um is the soil mineral balancing

551
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:06,720
Theory there are some bagged soils that

552
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:10,558
I will use there's sensy side that I

553
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:13,600
like to use in southern Oregon um I had

554
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:15,678
U I grew the these monster plants um in

555
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,399
southern Oregan a few years ago and I

556
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,159
used that soil it was great it was a

557
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,440
cocoa core based mix that was also

558
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,520
balanced with Al soil mineral balancing

559
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,080
Theory um you know he was an agronomist

560
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,158
that came up with this this approach to

561
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,839
generating and remediating soil after

562
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,278
the dust bow um he saw that there was a

563
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:35,879
problem that needed to be fixed and he

564
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:38,440
came up with these

565
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,840
techniques and released it to the world

566
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,840
but it was all kind of ignored um

567
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:45,558
because there was a whole bunch of

568
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:49,278
ammonium nitrate that had just hit the

569
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:52,319
uh the industry um after the world war

570
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:54,319
and people you know are there was a

571
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,798
gentleman I forgot his name but he

572
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,038
realized that you can use ammonium

573
00:22:55,798 --> 00:22:59,440
nitrate to grow crops with and it

574
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:03,359
totally changed the world and it

575
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:07,080
produced tons of food for people um so

576
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:09,158
his theory um Dr Al his theories kind of

577
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:10,720
got brushed to the side because you know

578
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:12,480
we can use this byproduct from the

579
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,558
military industrial complex to grow all

580
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,038
this food but now it's kind of becoming

581
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,759
more applicable with medicinal plant

582
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:22,000
cultivation where people are really

583
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:24,798
trying to level up the the nutrient

584
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,278
cycling the nutrient availability um in

585
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:28,359
custom soil

586
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:30,359
mixes and so now it's becoming more

587
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:32,439
applicable um but you look at all of his

588
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:35,199
work and it's back you know in the 20s

589
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,640
and the 30s um but it's really

590
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,120
interesting and I definitely recommend

591
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,640
people look into it um any living soil

592
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:45,158
mix is going to be pretty good they

593
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,278
typically tend to be pretty expensive

594
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,200
and I recommend people learn how to mix

595
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:51,679
it and do it themselves cuz not only are

596
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,240
you going to have a soil composition and

597
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,720
a soil blend that's unique to you it'll

598
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,159
produce a unique expression within a

599
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,240
plant um resulting in an end product

600
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,000
that cannot be mimicked without your

601
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,400
very specific soil mix so you can dive

602
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,519
down this Rabbit Hole kind of learn a

603
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,278
little bit about Agronomy and create

604
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:14,319
your own soil mix that'll result in your

605
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:16,240
own unique product but what it also does

606
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:20,599
when when you learn this is you now have

607
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:23,240
the skill to take any soil outside and

608
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:26,079
turn it into a lush fertile Garden you

609
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:28,159
can take native soil from anywhere with

610
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:32,319
these practices and principles that you

611
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:35,159
can Implement and turn dead dirt into

612
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:36,678
living soil and have a farm anywhere

613
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:38,760
which I think is one of the most

614
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:41,200
invaluable skills that anyone can have

615
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:44,398
so I try to encourage people to to learn

616
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,558
how to use these techniques so that you

617
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:49,759
can then it's you can then just possess

618
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:51,798
what I think is one of the most valuable

619
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,200
skills and powers out there like there's

620
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:56,879
no bigger power than being able to feed

621
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,679
yourself off of the land because of

622
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,520
knowledge that you've Poss possessed and

623
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,038
learned you know absolutely yeah I mean

624
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,158
having the end goal of being able to use

625
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,440
the native soil out of your backyard and

626
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:08,520
use that then you wouldn't have to go to

627
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,038
the store to buy begged soil you know

628
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:11,918
spending money at the the hydroponic

629
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:13,158
store or your local Nursery um you

630
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,120
wouldn't have to do that if you're able

631
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:18,480
to take the the soil from your backyard

632
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:20,719
repurpose it you know maybe a lot of

633
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,839
these are soils are too compact

634
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,759
depending on where you live right but I

635
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:27,079
know a lot of people uh run into the

636
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:29,119
issue where there it's just too compact

637
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:32,079
not enough ariation so they have to add

638
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,918
ariation I know some people well first

639
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,839
of all generally advised to grab a so

640
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,440
test right you want to get a so test

641
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:38,678
find out what's in your soil to begin

642
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,679
and then kind of make adjustments from

643
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:42,759
there I know Tad hussy kiss organic

644
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:44,798
shout out to him he had found uh

645
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:46,919
considerable a heavy metals in in some

646
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:49,398
of his native soil I forget where

647
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:51,000
exactly it was on if it was his current

648
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:53,000
land or or past land but he had

649
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,519
mentioned that he's not really able to

650
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,079
use it so like for those folks that are

651
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,240
interested in using their native soil

652
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:01,079
you probably get a soil test to find out

653
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,519
what's in there to begin uh and then

654
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:05,319
kind of make adjustments from there 100%

655
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,519
so so that's kind of one of the

656
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:09,319
principles that are that are recommended

657
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,000
in this this soil balancing theory is

658
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,599
like you know step one you get a soil

659
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,919
test you see what's in it you see what

660
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:16,359
is lacking you see what it's abundant in

661
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:18,720
and then you make calculations and

662
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:21,000
alterations from there and if you do

663
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,278
have an abundance of heavy metals over

664
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,798
time you can remediate it with like

665
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:28,079
cover crops and biology but you may not

666
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:29,759
be able to immediately use um that soil

667
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:33,000
right away um if you're worried about

668
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,919
heavy metals or testing requirements um

669
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,440
there are also options of introducing

670
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:40,360
certain inputs that will kind of suck in

671
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,640
those those heavy metals things like

672
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:45,479
biochar there's also an amendment um

673
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,759
called zolly um which has a very unique

674
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,120
structure uh like molecular structure

675
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,240
that holds on to heavy metals also so

676
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:55,000
there are ways to like remediate heavy

677
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,480
metals but you're 100% right you a lot

678
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,960
of times cannot just take a native soil

679
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:03,038
um and start using it to to grow in um

680
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,919
you 100% have to get testing done and

681
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,319
then make calculations and alterations

682
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:08,278
from there good to know I'm going to

683
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:10,079
have to look into that uh so balancing

684
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:12,240
theory in more detail and kind of get

685
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,079
familiar with it uh because yeah that's

686
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,679
right now I am using just bag soil

687
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,558
started off with Fox pH otion forest

688
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:21,000
soil and I turn that in and I've been

689
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:23,599
using that soil for six seven Groves now

690
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,159
so you know adding organic inputs and

691
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:26,359
being able to reuse that so over and

692
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:28,520
over and over again so I don't have to

693
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:31,879
go to the store to buy begged soil

694
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:34,519
anymore I live in Las Vegas and uh it's

695
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,399
desert out here so like I'm really

696
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:38,759
nervous to try to use the the native

697
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:41,798
soil in my backyard it's mostly just

698
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,798
sand and rock and but hey I I've heard

699
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:46,079
it's possible so maybe I you need to

700
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:48,839
roll up my sleeves and figure it out

701
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:51,359
yeah there's people who even dry Farm in

702
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:53,678
sand and have success with it there's

703
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,199
there's all these different regenerative

704
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,840
and cultivation techniques um that are

705
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,200
really unique that have come up with

706
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:02,558
solutions to a lot of different problems

707
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,278
you just kind of got to look around for

708
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:07,278
them or ask someone who who might know

709
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:09,119
the answers yeah absolutely now for a

710
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:10,119
lot of folks uh that are tuning in

711
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:11,319
they're probably not going to use their

712
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,798
native soil they probably are going to

713
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:15,079
go out and buy a bag soil and then

714
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:17,918
they're going to attempt to use that as

715
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:20,319
a good starting point and then continue

716
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,399
to put in organic inputs and then of

717
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:25,359
course reuse that soil over and over

718
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,798
again if somebody's going that route or

719
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,599
even doing like a Coots mix where

720
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:31,240
they're creating their own soil mix

721
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:33,359
organic fertilizers or organic inputs

722
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,759
what do you recommend and how often to

723
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:38,158
apply them I know it's a very broad

724
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,319
question but throwing that at you see if

725
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,679
you can answer that it is a broad

726
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:48,079
question so I use amendments right I use

727
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:50,640
soil amendments to balance my soil and

728
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,759
then I focus on making those amendments

729
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,519
available to the plant and usable by the

730
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:59,079
plant through adding amino acids enzymes

731
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:01,880
carbohydrates poly saccharides um

732
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:06,759
biology and filling in the gaps of the

733
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:11,278
soil food web so fertilizers fertilizer

734
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:13,640
is kind of a funny word um so in terms

735
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:16,398
of fertilizers I guess the the

736
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:21,000
fertilizers that I use would be um

737
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:24,798
sources of soy amino acids as my um

738
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
cation form of nitrogen the nh4 positive

739
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:30,119
right um amino acids the building blocks

740
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,278
of proteins they're also needed to for

741
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:37,278
the formation of enzymes um I focus a

742
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:40,398
lot on amino acids in my grow um also

743
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:43,038
the cation form of of nitrogen found in

744
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:44,599
amino acids doesn't leech right you hear

745
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:48,038
about like nitrate runoff and stuff and

746
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:50,319
how it affects the environment um this

747
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:53,158
doesn't it it holds on to the negative

748
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:55,519
charge um cation exchange sites in the

749
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:58,278
soil better so that doesn't rinse out

750
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:02,720
opposed to um

751
00:29:58,278 --> 00:30:06,519
uh the NO3 negative annion that a lot of

752
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,480
nitrogen sources are so in terms of

753
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:11,798
fertilizer I use a lot of soy based

754
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,558
amino acids I also use a lot of

755
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:19,879
micronized inputs so I'll use things

756
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:22,839
like micronized lonite which is um

757
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:25,039
sulfur potassium magnesium right it's a

758
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:28,199
mineral that is rich in Sulfur potassium

759
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:31,839
and magnesium um and if I need those

760
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:34,640
nutrient sources those elements in my my

761
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:36,678
soil um or my plants require them I'll

762
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,200
add them in micronized form into a

763
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:40,759
solution um with like some fulvic acid

764
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,440
or some humic acid to kind of create my

765
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:45,158
own carbon based fertilizers I'll also

766
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,000
use things like micronized rock

767
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:50,600
phosphate um which is calcium phosphate

768
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,720
so it has a lot of calcium it has a lot

769
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:55,918
of phosphate in it um and phosphate is a

770
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,639
key part of energy production inside of

771
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:02,639
a plant um same thing with nitrogen so

772
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:04,558
there's um I think it's ATP adamine

773
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:07,199
triphosphate I think is how you

774
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:10,599
pronounce it right and it's um formed

775
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,679
with nitrogen and phosphorus right and

776
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:14,319
when you introduce both of them you're

777
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:16,720
you're kind of creating an energy source

778
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:20,439
for the plant so I do things I focus a

779
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,960
lot on amino acids micronized inputs

780
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:26,798
calcium phosphate potassium um in

781
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,798
micronized forms after I've custom built

782
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:29,359
my soil

783
00:31:27,798 --> 00:31:31,879
to have a balance of these different

784
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:35,199
nutrients with things like

785
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:39,039
gypsum um fishbone

786
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:43,360
meal uh greens sand crab meal shrimp

787
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:46,158
meal kelp meal um Lang bite like I

788
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:48,479
mentioned what else is in my soil mix

789
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,840
earthworm castings um earthworm castings

790
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,679
are also a source of nutrients um

791
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:54,319
however I don't know I don't I don't

792
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:57,278
know if I would consider them

793
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:58,558
fertilizer um yeah and then there's also

794
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:00,278
other inputs that I'll add that aren't

795
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,119
technically fertilizers things that just

796
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:04,880
kind of like promote cation exchange

797
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:09,038
capacity like uh Clays like bentonite

798
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,960
clay zeolite that's a lot of it for in

799
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:13,638
terms of like fertilizer is just I use

800
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,798
organic dry amendments that I mix into

801
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:19,798
soil with um a biology Source like Earth

802
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:23,119
room castings insect frass and then my

803
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:26,000
inert you know um organic matter things

804
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:29,199
like Pete M cocoa cor whatever so that's

805
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,398
mostly what I do I don't actually buy

806
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,000
much of anything that is like a nutrient

807
00:32:31,398 --> 00:32:35,678
Source except for those micronized

808
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,798
inputs but I like to use a lot of fulvic

809
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,440
acids and enzymes and amino acids also

810
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:42,599
to kind of like promote the availability

811
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,880
and mimic root exid

812
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:47,000
dates which is like the function of how

813
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,080
plants make plants I mean make nutrients

814
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,359
readily available got it yeah I use uh a

815
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,839
handful of those inputs that you

816
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:57,879
mentioned as well so you mentioned amino

817
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,480
acids and one thing uh I'm look at

818
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,440
online right now actually I pulled it up

819
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,639
is raw amino acids and uh these things

820
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,080
are quite expensive I mean uh you get 2

821
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:08,240
ounces for

822
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:10,079
$16.20 that's $8 an ounce or you get

823
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,319
like 2 pound for

824
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:15,278
$135 you talked about amino acids and

825
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:17,398
how you focus on that is a product like

826
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:19,119
this raw amino acids is this something

827
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:21,879
that you would potentially incorporate

828
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:23,158
in your garden is it useful so I think

829
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,039
that's a dietary

830
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:29,799
supplement um so no I wouldn't use that

831
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:31,359
I like to use bioag so they have a few

832
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:33,720
different products that have amino acids

833
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:36,638
they have calino they have Mulino um

834
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,240
they have nitroamino nitroamino is the

835
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:42,759
most potent one I think it's 14 or 15%

836
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,359
nitrogen um and that is not that

837
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:47,679
expensive I think it's a pound for like

838
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:51,158
$18 or something like that $15 um and it

839
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,759
goes a long way and no so I think what

840
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:55,278
you found was like a dietary supplement

841
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:57,879
for people because all all cells require

842
00:33:55,278 --> 00:34:00,558
amino acids and they helpful for humans

843
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,760
to consume and for the soil to utilize

844
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:05,720
and biology to utilize biology plant

845
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:07,720
cells human you know animal cells you

846
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,960
know we all use amino acids so no I

847
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,760
don't I wouldn't use that one okay no

848
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,720
this one actually is from NPK Industries

849
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,800
uh and it does talk about oh really yeah

850
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,598
yeah it does talk about like keates ion

851
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,720
nutrients and facilitating plane uptake

852
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,599
movement into cells yeah this particular

853
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:26,358
one does seem to be that sounds very

854
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,720
expensive yeah it does that's what I say

855
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:29,000
what I was asking is it even worth it to

856
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,719
buy it that way or can we get amino

857
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,320
acids from somewhere else you know we

858
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:36,759
can get amino acids from from other

859
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,960
places um you know since cells are all

860
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,720
made of proteins you can break proteins

861
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,440
back down into amino acids using enzymes

862
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:45,439
that break proteins down into amino

863
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,679
acids these are called proteolytic

864
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,240
enzymes or protees and it's a form of

865
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,760
enzyme that will take a protein and

866
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:55,000
break it back down into its original

867
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,839
amino acid form you can find this inside

868
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,119
of um U things like lactic acid bacteria

869
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:01,119
serum which I'm not sure if everyone's

870
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,160
familiar with but it's a fermentation of

871
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:06,640
milk with lactic acid bacteria

872
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:08,838
lactobacillus species um that then

873
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:11,159
contains protolytic enzymes that you can

874
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:13,078
add to plant matter that will break it

875
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:15,199
down and turn it into amino acids

876
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:17,440
there's also specific plant inputs that

877
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:21,279
are rich in amino acids things like aloe

878
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:24,519
vera which I'm a big fan of using in in

879
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,880
my soil and I'll just take aloe vera

880
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:28,920
whether cultivated by myself or from

881
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,000
like a grocery store clean it nice and

882
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,000
good so you don't have kind of like

883
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,960
funky weird stuff on it chop it up into

884
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,838
little pieces throw it in a blender

885
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,639
strain it and water it into your plants

886
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:40,759
and there's a lot of really simple

887
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:43,239
techniques like that that you can do to

888
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,119
introduce you know um amino acids as

889
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:47,319
well as different compounds and phyto

890
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:51,160
hormones to your garden um another one

891
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:53,400
that I really like is um red beet um it

892
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:56,039
is rich in a polysaccharide called inin

893
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:59,200
which is great at multiplying um

894
00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:01,199
bacteria it also has nitric oxide in it

895
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:03,199
which promotes um you know metabolic

896
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,919
processes inside of the plant the list

897
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:07,719
goes on and on and if you have something

898
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,000
growing in your native environment you

899
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:13,039
can actually look up the phytochemical

900
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:17,039
composition of that plant on websites

901
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:19,199
like Dr Duke's phytochemical database um

902
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,199
and it'll tell you the full

903
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:23,399
phytochemical composition and you can

904
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:25,719
take that information and look it up and

905
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,680
see what each organic acid's

906
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:30,559
physiological effect are on a plant and

907
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:33,358
integrate it into your garden and you

908
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:36,078
can identify what the parts per million

909
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:38,679
of phosphorus that contains potassium

910
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,160
nitrogen and so on so that you can take

911
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:42,838
your local native plants and through

912
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:45,399
fermentation or through just blending

913
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:47,639
and straining or composting or feeding

914
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,039
two insects you can integrate it into

915
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:52,598
your garden organically sustainably

916
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,480
regeneratively um there's just so many

917
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:56,440
cool things like that that would be

918
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,920
really difficult to cover all of them in

919
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:02,559
this in this talk but you can absolutely

920
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,880
go out and find stuff and integrate it

921
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:05,480
into your garden from your local

922
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,200
environment and I think that's where

923
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,039
like the creativity and the the art

924
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:11,679
really comes into living soil

925
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:13,318
cultivation I think one thing that

926
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:15,799
people worry about going that route is

927
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:17,440
bringing in pathogens right kind of

928
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,119
going back to the IMO process that we

929
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,920
talked about and bringing in good

930
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,280
microbes but they also could be bringing

931
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,400
in some bad microbes and I know with

932
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,440
fermentation if it's not done right

933
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,160
there could be bad microbes in there as

934
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,679
well

935
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:31,039
so I think that's one thing that kind of

936
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:32,440
that's true cautions people away from it

937
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:34,599
so but yeah you can definitely do it

938
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,440
safely from what I've learned and kind

939
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:38,160
of what you're mentioning here so I

940
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,240
guess it's just a matter of uh following

941
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,039
it step by step and doing your due

942
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:44,479
diligence and uh looking under a

943
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:46,318
microscope and seeing if those bad

944
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,519
microbes exist in there or not or if

945
00:37:46,318 --> 00:37:50,400
there are just good microbes in there

946
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:53,239
and then utilizing that that's really

947
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,440
difficult to do um you know you can make

948
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:56,279
a slide and look at it under a

949
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,639
microscope but being able to identify

950
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:01,680
which

951
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:04,400
species um in which fungi based on their

952
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:06,799
like morphological properties is

953
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,519
extremely difficult um and you could be

954
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,560
sitting there looking at stock images

955
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:12,159
all day long trying to find the one

956
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:16,679
thing and then think that you found it

957
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:20,039
and you haven't um it's it's difficult

958
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:22,639
it's difficult to do um and often times

959
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:24,279
you see people posting microscopy images

960
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:26,759
making claims that they've found this

961
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,319
particular thing and they're completely

962
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:32,200
base um it's it's definitely there's a

963
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:34,639
reason why you know people are you go to

964
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:37,519
college and study for for years and

965
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:39,440
years and years behind this particular

966
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:41,318
uh this study you know it's it's

967
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,880
definitely really difficult um but

968
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:46,440
you're 100% right like you can bring in

969
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,960
pathogens from the outside um which is

970
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,679
one of the reasons why I'm really big

971
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:54,280
into um insect um breakdown of things

972
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:57,358
because their gut microbiome is really

973
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,599
effective at breaking down pathogens

974
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:01,799
um and then it's a much safer way to

975
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:06,400
introduce it which is why I really like

976
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:08,880
earthworm castings and insect f um and

977
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,880
things like you know doing turning of

978
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,760
compost piles and stuff I have seen so

979
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,200
many people incorrectly compost and

980
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,520
incorrectly make IMO and introduce

981
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:22,639
pathogens to their Garden um it is it's

982
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:26,039
hard it's hard to do it um and it takes

983
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:28,239
finesse it takes a lot of attention to

984
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:29,519
detail and thoroughness to really

985
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:32,679
accomplish

986
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:34,960
fully and like effectively um I just

987
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:38,719
Outsource that labor to the bugs you

988
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,480
know that's that's my Approach um but

989
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:42,078
yeah you're 100% right you can

990
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,599
absolutely go out and take something

991
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,318
from somewhere and bring it in um

992
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:48,519
especially if your native environment

993
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:51,079
isn't entirely healthy and your native

994
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:53,239
you know ecosystem isn't fully intact

995
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:54,839
that makes total sense now we took a

996
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:57,479
short break and you mentioned uh

997
00:39:54,838 --> 00:40:00,279
something that you wanted to talk about

998
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,838
root exit dates root exites yeah let's

999
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,720
get into that have you yeah are you

1000
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:08,159
familiar with root exit dates at all

1001
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:10,919
yeah a little bit okay um so root exites

1002
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:14,559
are compounds that are secreted by roots

1003
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,880
to facilitate several functions um one

1004
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:19,880
that I've touched on before um is that

1005
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,800
they they feed specific profiles of

1006
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:25,440
biology to accomplish specific goals for

1007
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,760
example there will secrete profiles of

1008
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,358
amino acids enzymes carbohydrates that

1009
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,400
promote the um multiplication of

1010
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:35,358
phosphorus cycling um bacteria this is

1011
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,480
called the rise of fagy

1012
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:40,358
cycle and during particular stages in

1013
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,318
the plant's development it has different

1014
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:45,358
profiles of root exites and of these

1015
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:49,559
compounds I just mentioned to feed

1016
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:51,119
specific species of bacteria to make

1017
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:52,599
certain nutrients available during

1018
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,318
certain stages in the correct

1019
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:58,800
proportions that the plant wants them

1020
00:40:55,318 --> 00:41:00,838
right this is like the the the

1021
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,680
overwhelming majority of how nutrients

1022
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:05,960
are cycled um and delivered to a plant

1023
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:08,598
in a living soil system is through root

1024
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,240
egg States and each plant is each

1025
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:13,599
species of plant is more or less

1026
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:16,679
effective at certain at feeding certain

1027
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:20,200
profiles or um yeah profiles of these

1028
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:22,919
compounds to feed specific species of

1029
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:25,719
bacteria so you'll see people introduce

1030
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,000
cover crops and companion plants living

1031
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:29,000
mulches

1032
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,679
that have a diversity of different plant

1033
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,800
species that are more or less effective

1034
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:36,559
at secreting root exid dates tailor to

1035
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,839
specific nutrients to make them

1036
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:42,440
available so you'll see people use

1037
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:43,880
Clover um for nitrogen um it fixes

1038
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,200
nitrogen from the

1039
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,920
atmosphere but it also solubilizes

1040
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:50,439
nitrogen in the rizosphere and then you

1041
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,200
have things like buckwheat which is

1042
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,000
really effective at um phosphorus

1043
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:58,318
solubilization um it secretes phosphates

1044
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,358
or it could be phosphotase

1045
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:04,279
anyway and um it's an enzyme that helps

1046
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:08,318
with nutrient cycling of phosphorus this

1047
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:11,400
is crucial this is like super key in BIO

1048
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:14,639
remediation of soil as well as making

1049
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,400
nutrients available to your plants and

1050
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:19,639
keep in mind that these profiles of

1051
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,079
biology you know while they are also I'm

1052
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:24,039
sorry these profiles of compounds while

1053
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:27,039
they're feeding biology they're also

1054
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:31,318
catalyzing chemical reactions and calent

1055
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:34,759
bonds in the soil to make nutrients you

1056
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:37,358
know transform from one form to another

1057
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:40,880
right so while living soil is like an

1058
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:44,279
ecosystem of bacteria and biology um

1059
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,838
it's also a Perpetual chemical reaction

1060
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:49,800
and so not only are we kind of working

1061
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:52,000
with nature um well chemistry is still

1062
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,400
nature but we are working with chemistry

1063
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,119
we're working with bacteria biology kind

1064
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,519
of forming an alliance with these these

1065
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,960
living organisms but we're also needing

1066
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:04,838
to understand how those aspects

1067
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,440
influence chemical reactions in the soil

1068
00:43:04,838 --> 00:43:09,159
and this is done a lot of the time

1069
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,240
through root exit dates um and we can

1070
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:13,239
introduce and kind of mimic root exit

1071
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:16,799
dates with the different compounds that

1072
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:18,358
we play with and that's like the the key

1073
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,680
the like the secret key behind

1074
00:43:18,358 --> 00:43:24,000
effectively growing living soil is is

1075
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:27,199
mimicking root exit dates cuz this is

1076
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,838
how most nutrients change forms and

1077
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,159
become readily available um there's also

1078
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:32,519
the the soil food web and how I

1079
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:34,598
mentioned earlier bacteria being

1080
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:36,079
consumed by protozoa but the vast

1081
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:38,200
majority of how nutrients are uptaken is

1082
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,839
through the rise of fagy cycle and how

1083
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:43,279
root exites interact with chemicals and

1084
00:43:40,838 --> 00:43:45,558
with Biology and those biology in that

1085
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,079
biology breaking down specific nutrients

1086
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:50,920
it's crazy the amount of reactions that

1087
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:53,039
are happening down in that area right I

1088
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,240
mean what blew my mind is back when I

1089
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:56,880
learned that uh you know acids were

1090
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:58,838
released by the plant in order to and

1091
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,680
you touched on this is kind of adjust

1092
00:43:58,838 --> 00:44:03,039
the pH uh to make nutrients more

1093
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:06,159
available right iron is is a good

1094
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,318
example of that where the pH is too high

1095
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:09,318
it's going to iron's going to be in a

1096
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:11,318
form that the plant can't uptake so the

1097
00:44:09,318 --> 00:44:13,239
release acids gets in the correct PH

1098
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:15,000
range then the iron is able to be

1099
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:18,639
converted into that form and uptaken by

1100
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,280
the plant so it's so fascinating and I

1101
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:22,598
feel like there's still so much that we

1102
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:25,319
don't know that we still learning about

1103
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:26,880
it and um man it goes above a lot of

1104
00:44:25,318 --> 00:44:28,639
people's heads it goes above my head to

1105
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,400
be honest with you because there's

1106
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:32,239
there's just so much to it it goes over

1107
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,240
everyone's head there's a tremendous

1108
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:38,118
amount about soil that we don't know um

1109
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:40,679
that nobody knows that we're just still

1110
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:43,039
figuring out and Yeah like he had said

1111
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:45,039
there's such a complex network of

1112
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:46,800
reactions happening that how they all

1113
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:49,199
function and how they all interconnect

1114
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,160
with each other is would be would be so

1115
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:54,199
difficult to study because it's all in

1116
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:56,799
this microcosm world that is really

1117
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:58,799
difficult to observe um and it's all

1118
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,839
mixed together and this like Melting Pot

1119
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,318
of of things that's separating them and

1120
00:45:00,838 --> 00:45:04,920
and studying them is really really

1121
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:07,440
difficult for humans to do um and often

1122
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:10,318
times we just kind of have to like let

1123
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,240
nature do it you know let nature take

1124
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:14,039
care of it let the biology take care of

1125
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:15,919
it yep and you know that's one thing

1126
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:17,199
that makes it so fun is like we're still

1127
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,400
identifying things and we're always

1128
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:22,118
going to be learning I think all of us

1129
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,680
that are living here on Earth right now

1130
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:25,358
uh we're going to be learning till the

1131
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,639
day we die right and still not

1132
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:29,400
everything's going to be uncovered in

1133
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:32,519
regards to Growing these plants and and

1134
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,838
uh soil biology and so on and so forth I

1135
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:35,838
think I read a stat somewhere where it's

1136
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:38,679
um

1137
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:43,078
99.9% of microbes haven't even been

1138
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:46,078
studied yet so it's like we've got way

1139
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:48,200
like yeah it's it's insane also is that

1140
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,039
they're constantly quote unquote

1141
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:51,960
evolving right they're they're not

1142
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:54,000
necessarily evolving as as much as like

1143
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,599
their genetic composition is constantly

1144
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,838
changing are you familiar with um

1145
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:03,200
horizontal Gene transfer no okay so this

1146
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:06,000
is cool um horizontal Gene transfer is

1147
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:07,960
when there is a microbial density of

1148
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,400
bacteria to where they're so tight

1149
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:13,240
together inside of like a biofilm or

1150
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,639
just like a you know sludge whatever

1151
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:17,118
inside a solution inside of water where

1152
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:19,519
there's so much compaction there's so

1153
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:22,318
much microbial density that they start

1154
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:25,480
tossing genes back and forth they start

1155
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:28,279
tossing DNA back and forth and those

1156
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,240
random combinations of DNA being passed

1157
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,559
back and forth can actually create new

1158
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:35,159
species of bacteria like

1159
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:38,000
spontaneously and this is how like the

1160
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:41,838
first evolutions and combinations of

1161
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,639
bacteria formed um were through this

1162
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:46,558
horizontal Gene transfer back in like

1163
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:50,118
the primordial soup of like early amino

1164
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:53,200
acids and humates and enzymes um you

1165
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:54,318
know it it's perpetually happening so

1166
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:56,558
you can

1167
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:59,639
experience biology

1168
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:01,000
changing potentially rapidly but it

1169
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:03,279
pretty much means that we will never

1170
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,760
ever ever document all the different

1171
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:09,440
species of bacteria um in the world cuz

1172
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,280
it's it's constantly changing so we

1173
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,720
could we could find new bacteria that do

1174
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,680
new things every day for the rest of our

1175
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:17,919
life you know and never and never find

1176
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:19,519
them all it's like this it's like trying

1177
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,440
to find the edge of the universe you

1178
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,519
know you just can't you just can't do it

1179
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,119
you're not going to be able to do it

1180
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:27,639
right yeah it actually reminds me of

1181
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:30,358
viruses viroid those can change up too

1182
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:32,199
right I mean we won't get too deep into

1183
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:34,239
to that when we get off the subject here

1184
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:37,919
but like it reminds me exactly of that

1185
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:40,519
how they're always changing evolving um

1186
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,079
yeah let's bring it back into kind of

1187
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:44,639
more of I guess uh let's Loop in the

1188
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:47,359
beginners and Inter media folks a little

1189
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:50,440
bit more and give them some actions okay

1190
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:52,199
what advice or tips do you have for

1191
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,960
folks that are maybe just getting

1192
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:56,078
started growing organically and they're

1193
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,639
really focusing on they want a better

1194
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,160
taste to come out of there they want a

1195
00:47:57,639 --> 00:48:02,358
better smell to be produced from these

1196
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:04,799
plants what's some uh advice you have

1197
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:06,159
for them I'd say like the the first kind

1198
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,800
of easy step is make sure you have

1199
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:10,159
enough Iration in your soil make sure

1200
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,119
that you maintain

1201
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:16,519
it wet you need to keep living soil

1202
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:19,440
moist there are some habits that people

1203
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:21,039
learn from growing um hydroponically

1204
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,838
that don't translate to living soil

1205
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:25,039
cultivation one of them is letting your

1206
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:26,558
soil dry out too much um and there

1207
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:28,358
probably will be people that disagree

1208
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,960
with me and want to talk about root

1209
00:48:28,358 --> 00:48:32,318
respiration um dry backs and stuff like

1210
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,440
that and I'd be happy to get into that

1211
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:36,880
conversation with people but you need to

1212
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:39,519
keep living soil wet one is because

1213
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,760
bacteria needs to be moist it needs to

1214
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:45,679
have um a a solution a space to exist a

1215
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:48,240
media which is water to exist in and to

1216
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:51,039
multiply in all of living soil processes

1217
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:52,679
are so much dependent on bacteria and

1218
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:54,599
biology that when they start getting dry

1219
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:56,960
they stop functioning properly the rise

1220
00:48:54,599 --> 00:49:00,079
of fagy cycle is very dependent on

1221
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:05,159
moisture keep your soil wet keep your

1222
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:06,880
soil irated that is the the I see it so

1223
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:09,558
much I see it so much so I have a

1224
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:13,079
patreon where I help people um and they

1225
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:14,720
post images and stuff like that um I see

1226
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:17,359
people just drying out their soil too

1227
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:19,919
much all the time just make sure you

1228
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:21,880
have enough biology um make sure you

1229
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,680
keep it wet and make sure that you have

1230
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:26,960
good drainage if you can do that you

1231
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:30,558
could just water only if you had enough

1232
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,400
soil you could water only um and grow a

1233
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:35,200
plant completely to finish in living

1234
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,798
soil um if you're having a small soil

1235
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:39,439
Mass it's going to be very difficult and

1236
00:49:36,798 --> 00:49:40,519
you will have to have to add nutrients

1237
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,400
um and it's going to be very difficult

1238
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:45,679
to keep nutrients balanced in a small

1239
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:50,039
pot living soil really wants large soil

1240
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:53,480
masses moisture and drainage and biology

1241
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:55,318
that's like the stepping stone for

1242
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:58,199
growing living soil and some people

1243
00:49:55,318 --> 00:49:59,798
really struggle with that um but but

1244
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:02,239
that's that's it that's like the

1245
00:49:59,798 --> 00:50:03,239
beginner step that I recommend to people

1246
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:05,598
and then you can get into like

1247
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:07,078
fermenting and you know adding different

1248
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:10,039
profiles and stuff like that after you

1249
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:11,480
learn about it you know um people it's a

1250
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:13,440
lot of fun to do these things people

1251
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,838
like to get ahead of themselves but you

1252
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:19,159
can make mistakes you can introduce

1253
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:21,759
pathogens you can add too much of an

1254
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:25,639
enzyme and cook your roots or kill your

1255
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:28,720
worms um kill your microarthropods it's

1256
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:31,719
it can be complicated um so just start

1257
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:34,159
with a lot of soil keep it moist keep it

1258
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:36,239
draining add simple inoculant like

1259
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:38,558
earthworm castings and insect fress if

1260
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:41,078
you want to use Bashi that's great use

1261
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,519
cover crops companion plants to provide

1262
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:44,400
like that diversity of rot ex States

1263
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:47,159
like we had discussed earlier and you

1264
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:50,240
can just water it you just you can just

1265
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:53,558
water it um I did a full run in a tent

1266
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:56,838
with a in like a 4x4 bed in a in a tent

1267
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:59,480
and it was just water companion plants

1268
00:50:56,838 --> 00:51:01,440
soil with you know nine plants in it and

1269
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,599
it just that was it and it was great it

1270
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,838
worked out great I didn't have to do

1271
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,440
anything to it super simple don't over

1272
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:09,358
complicate it yeah it definitely can be

1273
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,000
super simple now that's one thing that

1274
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:12,880
uh you know you talk about keeping

1275
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,239
things moist that's one thing I wasn't

1276
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,200
told when I first started growing

1277
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:18,879
organic so I was taking my practice grow

1278
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:21,239
using synthetics to where I was letting

1279
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,519
the medium dry out between waterings and

1280
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:24,759
then the plan was showing deficiencies

1281
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:26,440
and I'm like hm is organic really the

1282
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,640
easier way to about I was just doing it

1283
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,880
wrong I didn't have the medium moist

1284
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:31,480
enough I didn't keep a consistent

1285
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,640
moisture level and then of course I

1286
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,240
learned about that had much better

1287
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:37,519
success having a a moist medium the

1288
00:51:35,239 --> 00:51:40,039
whole time introduced blue mats Auto

1289
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:42,318
watering system so really dial in that

1290
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:44,239
moisture level in the medium and it's

1291
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:48,599
just been a GameChanger for me I love

1292
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:50,439
blue mats um I've used them for years um

1293
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:54,480
they're probably my favorite way to just

1294
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:56,159
keep soil wet um BL mats are great but

1295
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,519
yeah and and like you mentioned and I

1296
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:59,000
think it's important to note is that

1297
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:01,280
when you're growing in living soil and

1298
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,079
you let things dry out you start seeing

1299
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:06,480
symptoms um plant symptoms that mimic

1300
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:09,079
deficiencies when your soil actually has

1301
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,880
the nutrients in it that the plant needs

1302
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:15,200
but you let it dry out too much um and

1303
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,160
you know the the plant was not able to

1304
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:18,439
cycle nutrients effectively and then it

1305
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:20,960
started showing these signs of

1306
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,200
deficiencies and what people often do is

1307
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,079
they let their plants Dr out too much

1308
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:26,679
they see these deficiencies and then

1309
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,760
they have their but or themselves or a

1310
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:29,919
book help them identify the deficiency

1311
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,960
and then they start pumping it with that

1312
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,720
deficiency I mean with that nutrient you

1313
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:37,559
know and um and then they create an

1314
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:40,039
imbalance in the soil um that

1315
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:42,400
antagonizes another element you know

1316
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:44,480
creating an improper you know form

1317
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,680
improper Bond right an improper chemical

1318
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:50,000
reaction and now you're perpetuating

1319
00:52:46,679 --> 00:52:51,239
this teen reaction of aors in your soil

1320
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,960
and you start seeing all these different

1321
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:54,679
Burns you start seeing overdoses of

1322
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,358
nutrients you start seeing deficiencies

1323
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:58,039
of nutrients and you're chasing your

1324
00:52:56,358 --> 00:52:59,039
tail around trying to pump your soil

1325
00:52:58,039 --> 00:53:02,000
with all these different nutrients

1326
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:04,480
spending all this money um when you just

1327
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,679
need to keep your soil wet and that's

1328
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,159
that's tough that's hard for people and

1329
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:09,798
then they want to be like no I know that

1330
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:11,838
it needs more more calcium I know it

1331
00:53:09,798 --> 00:53:13,838
needs more magnesium I know it needs

1332
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:15,159
more nitrogen and they just start

1333
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:17,159
hitting it and hitting it and hitting it

1334
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:19,798
and then things get out of whack things

1335
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:21,399
get out of balance you know bacteria

1336
00:53:19,798 --> 00:53:23,159
colonies break down they don't function

1337
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,880
properly it's

1338
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:27,838
just keep keep it wet keep it wet keep

1339
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:30,200
it full of biology that's got to be one

1340
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:32,599
of the biggest frustrations for new

1341
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:34,879
organic Growers is keeping that Medium

1342
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:37,160
moist and then yeah going through the

1343
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,519
the Motions that you mentioned is like

1344
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:40,440
you know things dry out and you see

1345
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:42,358
deficiencies and do adding inputs and so

1346
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,039
on and so forth you can just sounds like

1347
00:53:42,358 --> 00:53:46,119
a headache sounds like a big headache

1348
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:48,358
there it is it's a huge headache now you

1349
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:50,358
mentioned you caution people on using

1350
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:52,598
small container sizes what's your

1351
00:53:50,358 --> 00:53:56,679
recommended minimum container size to

1352
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:59,280
use for Organics you can pull off 20

1353
00:53:56,679 --> 00:54:01,679
I like to use 45 G for for a single

1354
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:05,359
plant um if I'm using a

1355
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:08,078
container um I grow in beds though I

1356
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:10,920
grow in big

1357
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:14,240
4x8 you know in like an indoor setting

1358
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:16,960
of 4x8 bed um you know that's at least

1359
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:18,798
12 in deep I like to have them 18 in

1360
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,679
deep if you don't have enough drainage

1361
00:54:18,798 --> 00:54:24,079
18 in can provide problems so 12 is good

1362
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:27,239
for most people but my bad at my

1363
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:30,920
Greenhouse is 5 ft wide and 60 ft long

1364
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:32,479
you know and 18 in deep uh and that's

1365
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,159
that's how I prefer to grow is I like to

1366
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,480
have a solid soil mask cuz now it turns

1367
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:39,759
into like an entire ecosystem um and

1368
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:41,679
roots go really far and micro risal

1369
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,559
networks go really far and things get

1370
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:45,239
transported from really long distances

1371
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:47,798
nutrients can be transported long

1372
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:49,838
distances through micro isal networks

1373
00:54:47,798 --> 00:54:53,039
But to answer your question 20 gallons I

1374
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:55,159
think is minimum 45 is what I recommend

1375
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:58,079
um but growing in beds is what I think

1376
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:59,679
is ideal in living soil cultivation that

1377
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,559
makes sense yeah I mean I've tried

1378
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:04,440
growing in you know organic in puts in

1379
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,839
one gallon containers three gallons five

1380
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:09,000
gallons I had pretty good results with

1381
00:55:06,838 --> 00:55:10,798
seven gallons okay then I worked my way

1382
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,400
up to 10 gallons which I'm actually in

1383
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:14,719
right now and I'm having some pretty

1384
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:17,039
good success but I know that as a track

1385
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:20,279
record the bigger container I go the

1386
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:21,480
easier it's getting you know so uh it's

1387
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,400
only a matter of time before I'm in a

1388
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,358
bed I actually have a twoot by 10 foot

1389
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:29,200
bed outside for my vegetable garden and

1390
00:55:26,358 --> 00:55:30,838
I love it as far as my indoors only

1391
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:34,038
amount of time before I'm in beds as

1392
00:55:30,838 --> 00:55:36,519
well so good advice there fantastic

1393

00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:31,759
recipes and my approaches you know as

1418
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:35,279
well as how I like to shape plants and

1419
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:37,559
um just My overall General approach to

1420
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,440
living soil cultivation so it's all

1421
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:44,359
mostly on Instagram @ Luna all day the a

1422
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:47,240
in Luna and all is shared so um l u n a

1423
00:56:44,358 --> 00:56:49,159
l l d a y that's that's that's pretty

1424
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:51,078
much it awesome I'll definitely have a

1425
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:53,078
link to where people can find you down

1426
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:54,359
in the YouTube description section below

1427
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:55,760
and then if you're on one of the podcast

1428
00:56:54,358 --> 00:56:57,759
platforms just just search for her

1429
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,200
you'll find her I have a gut feeling

1430
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,280
here that there's going to be quite a

1431
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:04,318
few people in the comment section asking

1432
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,880
for a part two so uh if we get enough

1433
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:08,880
people demanding to for a part two would

1434
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,559
you be willing to come on for a part two

1435
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,039
where we talk about something else kind

1436
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,359
of maybe dive deeper into one of the

1437
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:15,039
areas or talking about a different area

1438
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:16,838
that you have knowledge on I'd love to

1439
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:18,319
there's there is so much to talk about

1440
00:57:16,838 --> 00:57:20,199
there's an endless amount of topics to

1441
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:22,199
talk about in living soil so I would be

1442
00:57:20,199 --> 00:57:23,960
happy to thank you awesome well if you

1443
