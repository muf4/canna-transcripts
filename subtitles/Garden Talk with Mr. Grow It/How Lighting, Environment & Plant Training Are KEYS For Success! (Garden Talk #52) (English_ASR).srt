1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
coming up on garden talk with the more

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,759
experience you kind of see how your

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,200
plant tries to get away from the light

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,440
like you can see the light stress with

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,559
proper experiences we're trying to say

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:15,359
go about 300 for seedling between three

7
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,759
and six hundred and veg and between six

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,358
and like 900 in flower they saved my

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,679
butt a couple times telling me about a

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,600
power outage it's not just at home where

11
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,759
you'll get notifications you could be

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,080
absolutely anywhere main lining is one

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,000
of my most favorite ways to grow i just

14
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,079
enjoy getting all that energy to the top

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
of the plants do your tucking until the

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,679
end of week one now that could change

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,320
obviously if you're going with like a

18
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:41,359
more sativa strain i would probably tuck

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,840
until like maybe the end of week two

20
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,519
like i have no one to impress either to

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,760
you you have no one to impress just

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,760
throw your herb and have fun doing it

green will come up let's start with

138
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,000
lighting what grow lights are you

139
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:07,439
currently using

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,800
i use uh the mars hydro fc 6500 is one

141
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,000
of my main lights

142
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:16,400
and then i use uh a couple of the sp

143
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,038
3000s and then i just put in an fc 8000

144
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,719
uh into one of my four by fours

145
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,800
uh i know i'll get a little pushback

146
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,880
with that people think it's overkill for

147
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,840
me to be running uh 8 000 watt light in

148
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,800
a 4x4 but i just run it dimmed at like

149
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,239
50 60 percent uh just because i have

150
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,400
that much power

151
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,079
uh in the tent it doesn't mean that i'm

152
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,120
using it all so

153
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,120
uh

154
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,478
that's that's basically what i'm using

155
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,639
do you say 8 000 watts or sorry 800 watt

156
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,639
it's all right that's good 8 000 yeah

157
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,600
that is an overkill

158
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,600
burning down the house

159
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,600
that's enough that's enough watts for

160
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,159
multiple rooms in your house right

161
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,160
oh yeah i'm running the manufacturer

162
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,520
facility there

163
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,520
yeah mars hydro they have some good

164
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,918
lights for sure yeah they've come uh

165
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,918
it's come a real long way like uh

166
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,318
honestly a few years ago i probably

167
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,399
wouldn't have touched them but uh over

168
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,680
the years they're really you can see

169
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:13,758
they're really starting to pick things

170
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,199
up they're uh

171
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,520
they're making

172
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,520
good quality lighting and fairly cheap

173
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,879
for like people getting into it and

174
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:24,639
stuff i find anyway and uh honestly i

175
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,959
found their customer service to get a

176
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,560
little bit better i am sponsored by them

177
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,159
so obviously i'm gonna get top of the

178
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,038
line customer service

179
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,720
but uh my subscribers i noticed are not

180
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,959
complaining to me about their customer

181
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,199
service so much anymore it's like they

182
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,239
step their level up a little bit and i'm

183
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,879
actually like

184
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,879
before i i wouldn't be proud to say i

185
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,800
was working with mars hydro and today i

186
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,959
could actually say i am

187
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,038
i am proud to be working with them like

188
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,918
yeah i remember their blurples back in

189
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,038
the day i mean 2015 14 2015 and they

190
00:06:53,918 --> 00:07:00,079
were selling those lights all the way up

191
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,079
until like 2019 i think they still are

192
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,439
i'm not sure if they are but yeah yeah i

193
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,160
think they took them down i think they

194
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,598
have everything seriously yeah yeah i've

195
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,039
given them that feedback i'm like why

196
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,598
are you selling all day lights like well

197
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,680
they sell it's like

198
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,598
i noticed uh

199
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,959
viper spectra companies still selling

200
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:21,120
those on amazon uh the purple ones

201
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,560
are they really yeah they actually have

202
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,918
a new light though which i'm actually

203
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,399
getting my hands on it they're sending

204
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,399
me over one it's a bar style light and i

205
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,000
was impressed with the specs i think

206
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,120
actually by the time this episode is

207
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,879
released i don't think they're going to

208
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,038
have the light released so i'm not going

209
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,279
to talk too deep into it but they're

210
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,360
another company that's come a long way

211
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:42,239
in regards to the fixture like the

212
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,720
quality wise build of the fixture good

213
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,478
stuff these days for sure yeah i i've

214
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,759
always liked that company they do have

215
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,079
quality stuff like they're called

216
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,360
quantum boards they're all quality you

217
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,279
could tell that they take care of their

218
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,038
stuff and uh that new light you're

219
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,519
talking about yeah people are gonna be

220
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:00,159
uh impressed with that i got the the

221
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,478
download details on that thing a couple

222
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,080
months ago and it does sound like it's

223
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,318
going to be a pretty good light

224
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:09,519
that and they do have others coming on

225
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,400
the way to that i won't really speak of

226
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,719
yeah

227
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,878
i'm running the so i have three grow

228
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,720
lights right now i have a 4x4 tent where

229
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,360
i'm running two lights i'm running the

230
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,560
es 300 v3 by the green sunshine company

231
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,479
on one side and then the sf 2000 led

232
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,639
grill light by spider farmer on the

233
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,478
other side i personally grow you know

234
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,680
all different cultivars within the tent

235
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:31,918
and so

236
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,918
for me i personally like to run two

237
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,319
lights in there so i can have different

238
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,838
light distances as needed as some grow

239
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,760
taller than the other so that's what i'm

240
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,519
currently running and then i have a 2x4

241
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:45,519
tent which has a es180 v3 by the green

242
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,200
sunshine company and all those lights

243
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,039
i've really gotten some good results off

244
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,160
of but you have to run them dimmed right

245
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,919
there's

246
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,278
these grow lights these days a lot of

247
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,838
them are

248
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,679
more powerful than needed you know and

249
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,240
the problem is there's a lot of new

250
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,759
growers they want to run on the max they

251
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,440
think they're they're helping their

252
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,919
plants more when they're running them on

253
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,600
full power when in reality a lot of

254
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:09,120
these new lights you can dim them down

255
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,639
and actually run them dimmed for the

256
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,919
entire grow right yeah exactly like uh

257
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:18,240
that's uh that's what i i i tell people

258
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:21,278
like when people question me on the show

259
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,519
or on my video sorry uh they say well

260
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,039
what should i run my light at and i will

261
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,039
answer them well first i need to know

262
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,319
like what kind of light you have uh

263
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,120
because they're all so different

264
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,360
nowadays from the quantum style to the

265
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,759
bar lights uh like you might have to run

266
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,320
a different wattage but not only that is

267
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,319
they're so efficient nowadays that you

268
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,278
i don't even know how you would go by

269
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,160
gram

270
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,919
for water anything anymore or go by buy

271
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,519
per watt because they're just so

272
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,240
efficient you're either cranking them up

273
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,399
or

274
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,959
or you don't need to crank them up it's

275
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,559
either one way or the other so uh when

276
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,518
people ask me

277
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,399
uh

278
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,320
how do i run my light it's like check to

279
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,440
check the manufacturer what they

280
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,200
recommend

281
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,120
or uh do a quick google search to see uh

282
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,879
see if you could find your answer there

283
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,000
or you could just watch your plants

284
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:14,000
altogether like we used to do uh

285
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,078
back in the day before parameters and

286
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,078
stuff and uh you just watch your plant

287
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,319
for like your tips turning down the

288
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:22,159
talking like the light stress how your

289
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,760
planet is like trying to shrivel its way

290
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,719
it's just trying to get away from that

291
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,399
light uh you could see it uh with a

292
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,320
little bit of uh

293
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,278
education or something the word that i'm

294
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,519
trying to use uh anyway you just see it

295
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,958
the more you grow the more you'll see

296
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,720
signs of it trying to get away from the

297
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,000
light and stuff like that yeah it

298
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,879
definitely comes down to experience i

299
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,639
think is what you're trying to

300
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,399
experience

301
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,879
but i don't know

302
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,120
but uh yeah with the more experience you

303
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,879
kind of see how your light or how your

304
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,399
plant tries to get away from the light

305
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,838
like you can see the light stress with

306
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,440
proper experience that's what i'm trying

307
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,920
to say yeah

308
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,079
so the light energy coming down is

309
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,399
photons you know a lot of people refer

310
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:04,319
to as kind of like pictured as balls of

311
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,240
energy coming down like rain onto your

312
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,519
plant right you you increase the amount

313
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,120
of density increasing amount of rain or

314
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,839
photons that's coming down onto the

315
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,639
plant now people refer to that you know

316
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,959
par photosynthetically active radiation

317
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,278
are you aiming for a specific amount of

318
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,799
par or dli

319
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:26,320
yeah uh

320
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:31,359
dli i i truly i typically try to run

321
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,879
around uh 40 dli at all times but uh

322
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,839
what i'm again when i'm trying to

323
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,838
explain it to new growers and stuff i'll

324
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,600
i'll be a little more uh

325
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,120
lenient with my words and i'll tell them

326
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,519
like go about 300 for uh seedling

327
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,480
between three and six hundred and veg

328
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,278
and uh between six and like 900 in

329
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,680
flower um i try to stay away from

330
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,120
telling them hey crank it to uh 1250 and

331
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,039
flower because i don't want to see

332
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,200
anybody burn their plants up

333
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:00,958
honestly if you're seeing like uh

334
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,040
deficiencies or

335
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,479
or something like that chances are it's

336
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,838
too much light you're giving them so

337
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,278
much light that they're trying to take

338
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,720
up their nutrients more so then you're

339
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,679
getting that burn

340
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,680
so uh yeah i try to just

341
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,599
be a little more lenient with

342
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:19,278
the ppfd levels that i tell people to

343
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,759
use but for myself yeah i'm around a dli

344
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:25,278
of around 40. sometimes i will push it

345
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:27,200
depending on strain uh ambient co2 is

346
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:30,159
usually around four or five hundred but

347
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,560
i'm in my house it's usually around 750

348
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:35,838
so uh i'll be able to play around with

349
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:39,759
my uh ppfd a little bit sometimes i'll

350
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:42,480
get it up to around 1200 uh 1250 but for

351
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,399
the most part i'm maxed out around 10.50

352
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,879
in flower i think there's some good

353
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,278
general ranges that you mentioned before

354
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,120
for for beginners or somebody who isn't

355
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,639
quite aware of it because that'll

356
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,200
that'll help you kind of kind of like in

357
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,120
safe ranges i'd say exactly not a lot of

358
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,959
folks they're not going to have the par

359
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,560
meter in order to kind of measure it

360
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,559
right you could you go and buy one of

361
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,399
these par meters apogee has ones there's

362
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,159
a spot on par meter there's several

363
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,679
different measurement tools now that you

364
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:09,679
can use to measure the amount of par

365
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,120
that that your light puts out and then

366
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:13,039
you kind of adjust your light distance

367
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,959
that way if you don't have one of those

368
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,639
and you don't want to spend the money on

369
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,319
one of those you could always what i

370
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,399
usually tell folks is

371
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,920
check out the park chart that the

372
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,399
manufacturer puts on the grow light

373
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,599
listing right so usually you know most

374
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,919
companies i think just about every

375
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,040
company now is putting a par chart on

376
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:30,879
there it's going to be basically an

377
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:33,360
overview snapshot

378
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:34,480
of the different part numbers in ppfd

379
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,159
that shows you at the different like

380
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,759
distances so you kind of refer to that

381
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,679
chart and then adjust your light

382
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,519
distance that way i think that's that's

383
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,879
usually what i tell folks that are

384
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,720
beginning but yeah those ranges you

385
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:47,360
mentioned are pretty spot on in my

386
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,839
opinion i know you have the pulse pro

387
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,480
how do you like that i do i've actually

388
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,639
i got four of them and uh i like them

389
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,320
quite a bit i uh

390
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,919
i'll be a little honest with you i did

391
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,920
start off using them for uh vpd but

392
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,559
without having a sealed room it's so

393
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:07,039
difficult to keep that vpd

394
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,439
day in day out

395
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,519
right head on uh hitting the nail on the

396
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,839
head type deal it's hard to do without a

397
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,759
sealed room so i just keep it as close

398
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:20,160
as i can to the vpd and i go from there

399
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,240
but uh they're a real cool unit like uh

400
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:26,000
now you could actually get a

401
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,320
somewhat basic ppfd reading with them

402
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,320
that's awesome you can see your spectrum

403
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,839
uh most leds are going full spectrum

404
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,959
nowadays anyway

405
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,720
uh but uh yeah i i really like them they

406
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,599
saved my butt a couple times telling me

407
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,680
about a power outage so uh it's not just

408
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,440
at home where you'll get notifications

409
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,120
you could be absolutely anywhere i could

410
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,120
be across the country

411
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,278
or and or in a different country and

412
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,278
still be able to get that reading so

413
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:54,000
uh not to uh

414
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:56,240
totally try to advertise for them but uh

415
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,480
they are a real awesome unit

416
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,919
uh i find anyway yeah i was curious

417
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,399
about the pulse pro in particular

418
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,958
because it does have co2 readings and

419
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,600
also has the the par meter on it built

420
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,439
in

421
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,639
you know so you can check what the par

422
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,399
is and adjust your light distance

423
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,320
according to that now some people might

424
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,240
get sticker shock once they see that the

425
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,600
price is five hundred dollars right sure

426
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,480
you know and i had sticker shock at

427
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,000
first

428
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,759
but you know somebody commented on one

429
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,679
of my videos and like think about it

430
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:22,799
though right you're getting a par meter

431
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,719
within it

432
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,439
you know that alone the apogee sells for

433
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,639
like 525 alone so you're getting a par

434
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,320
meter you're getting the co2

435
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,399
measurements obviously the temperature

436
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,000
and humidity and you're getting the the

437
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,839
ability to have it sent to your

438
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,120
smartphone if something's out of range

439
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,279
right so you're getting those

440
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,639
notifications when needed if things are

441
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:44,240
out of range i have the pulse one

442
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,600
need to get the pulse pro i think i

443
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,600
think that's my next one of my next

444
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,240
purchases for sure yeah they're pretty

445
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,839
cool and uh yeah you touch on the price

446
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,839
of like a

447
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,800
parameter well that's the same thing for

448
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,720
like a co2 meter a good co2 meter you're

449
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,319
not finding under 100 bucks for like a

450
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,120
good one you know

451
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
so

452
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,078
yeah

453
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,440
actually the price isn't bad if you

454
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,519
actually think about everything that's

455
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,800
in it it would be nice to see them

456
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,120
cheaper but

457
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:13,519
it is what it is right yep

458
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,720
so what temperature do you typically aim

459
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,078
for

460
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,278
uh

461
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:22,559
so in veg i'll usually be around uh 28

462
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:24,958
degrees celsius i think that's like 82

463
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,198
83 maybe fahrenheit

464
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,599
and veg i'm usually around there and

465
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:32,639
then as i get into flour i like to cool

466
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,480
things down a bit i'll i'll usually run

467
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:38,480
around 25 degrees during the day maybe

468
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,240
22 degrees at night

469
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,079
and that's the same thing for veg at

470
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,519
night i go down to about 24 degrees

471
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,559
celsius so

472
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,278
when i talk i'm talking in celsius

473
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,919
and yeah anyway i find in flour uh it's

474
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:54,159
better off to go by like how true nature

475
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:57,039
uh goes it usually cools down in the

476
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,879
fall so uh not only that i find it

477
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,599
tightens up your buds and stuff if you

478
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,198
run it a little cooler in flower

479
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,880
i'm not sure if you notice that but it's

480
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:05,838
just something that i picked up on over

481
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,839
the years

482
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:11,519
and uh yeah so i always try to run a

483
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:13,438
little cooler and flour and uh warmer

484
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,959
and veg you bring up a really really

485
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,360
good point as far as the increased

486
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,439
temperatures and veg and then reducing

487
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,198
it in flour what so first off i need to

488
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,079
have a uh i need to learn celsius

489
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,959
because i

490
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:27,438
i'm stuck in the the freedom units as uh

491
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,120
as uh pigeons often calls it yeah maybe

492
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,880
if i have a key right here i can see

493
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,399
okay if he's talking this this is that

494
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,039
you know and it's like quickly refer to

495
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,798
it i usually aim for you know around 80

496
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:40,879
82 degrees fahrenheit in the vegetation

497
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:43,119
stage and oftentimes i'm running that

498
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,720
throughout flowering now i'm currently

499
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,279
in school a lot of people know that i'm

500
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,880
in school for cultivation and one of the

501
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,960
studies that was brought to my attention

502
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,559
through this school

503
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,759
is that they studied the optimal

504
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,038
temperature what is the opportunity

505
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,480
temperature and they're doing pretty

506
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:59,200
much what you're doing they're seeing

507
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,038
that high increased photosynthesis with

508
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,759
the higher temps you know assuming that

509
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,440
the vpd is dialed in co2 is dialed in

510
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,000
right so they're going after the high

511
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,160
photosynthesis during veg a little bit

512
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,519
into flower as well however towards the

513
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,160
end of flower they're finding a if you

514
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,319
stay at that high temps they're seeing

515
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,320
that more area blood structure

516
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,480
foxtelling can potentially occur and

517
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,960
also loss of terpenes they're

518
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,400
evaporating so their recommendation what

519
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,919
they found in the study is that if

520
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,600
you're lowering in those temps a little

521
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,520
bit towards the end of flowering maybe

522
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,599
weeks five six and beyond i'm just

523
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,599
gradually lowering them you can conserve

524
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,319
some of those terpenes and it should

525
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,159
result in more tighter uh bud sites like

526
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,599
you had mentioned that that you often

527
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,600
see now of course that's going to depend

528
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,279
on genetics and stuff like that but i

529
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,759
thought i was worthy mentioning here

530
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:50,000
because uh something i learned recently

531
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,759
so now how about uh relative humidity

532
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,480
what are you typically aiming for there

533
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:58,160
i uh in veg i try to shoot for 65. but

534
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,919
it's hard to get that here in the winter

535
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,200
even using like

536
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:08,000
a humidifier so i always try to keep it

537
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,679
around at least 50 to 65 in uh veg

538
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,759
sometimes i can't always get there and

539
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,640
it's somewhere around 45 and i just got

540
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:17,679
the humidifiers pumped but uh for the

541
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,240
most part if it is around 55 i'm happy

542
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:24,320
and then in flower i shoot for around 50

543
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,319
percent so uh 50 of flour just seems to

544
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:28,798
it's always worked for me i've done it

545
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,159
like that for a few years now and uh

546
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:32,798
uh

547
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,519
it's what i prefer gotcha so there are

548
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,879
some general ranges that folks stick by

549
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,879
you know there's a lot of you know if

550
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,080
you're a bare bones beginner just

551
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,280
starting out you just want to get

552
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,000
through your grow

553
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,440
40 to 60 is kind of the general range

554
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,640
that the plant is going to grow it's

555
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,480
going to be fine you're going to get a

556
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,759
yield out of it right but dialing things

557
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,480
in which is kind of what we're talking

558
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,919
about here you know vpd you know we

559
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,038
talked about that a little while ago

560
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,960
right so

561
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,200
when your temperature changes according

562
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,360
to vpd your humidity should kind of

563
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,120
change as well right it should kind of

564
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,918
change with it really comes down to the

565
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,918
stomata opening and being able to to

566
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,240
intake that co2

567
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,520
specific rate right so i personally do

568
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,319
aim for

569
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,798
vpd i find that i can actually naturally

570
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,720
fall within that range just by the way

571
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,038
my room is set up so

572
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,839
oftentimes when i'm running that 80 82

573
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:25,919
degrees i think vpd calls for

574
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:29,759
turning remember off top my head

575
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:32,240
like 55 to 60 something 62 percent or

576
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:33,599
something like that and of course

577
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,919
see the confusing thing is there's so

578
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,599
many different vpd charts online so if

579
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,520
you were to search vpd chart you would

580
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,439
get so many different results i think a

581
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,000
lot of people go after pulse

582
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,759
their reference guides but then there's

583
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,119
different guides according to

584
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,038
the difference in leaf surface

585
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,199
temperature which makes things even more

586
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:52,798
confusing so

587
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,038
generally speaking usually it's like

588
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,879
minus one degree on the leaf surface

589
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,879
temperature so what your canopy

590
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,000
temperature is for example

591
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,760
your leaf surface temperature is usually

592
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,359
you know one degree less now lighting is

593
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,879
going to turn in is going to be an

594
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,199
impact of that right if you're hid

595
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,559
lighting you're going to have the ir

596
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,960
come down and heat those leaves a little

597
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:15,279
bit more than led so there is just so

598
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,519
many variables when it comes to humidity

599
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,798
in my opinion you know but yeah general

600
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,038
ranges are certainly these general

601
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,639
ranges that folks can go by just to get

602
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:25,599
to the grow right

603
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,919
yep so do you supplement co2 at all

604
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,719
uh no i uh

605
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,840
i used to do like uh the own

606
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,440
uh i would make my own like milk jugs

607
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,720
full of uh

608
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,759
uh

609
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,079
the sugar and yeast and try and do co2

610
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:45,279
like that and uh honestly that would

611
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:48,079
work if i didn't use an exhaust van if i

612
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:50,079
was able to keep it cool enough

613
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,480
inside a tent with an air conditioner

614
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:54,399
and not exhausted out it would work but

615
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,240
if you're running any sort of exhaust

616
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,840
fan even just into a lung room it it

617
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,599
really doesn't help all that much you

618
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,678
really need to get that bottle hooked up

619
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:06,879
if you want to take the advantage of co2

620
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,159
i find uh even with um i don't want to

621
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,559
throw them under the bus or anything but

622
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,240
like the tnb naturals

623
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,000
i really don't find that works it's

624
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,240
basically the same thing that i made if

625
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,759
you're doing any exhausting at all

626
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,798
you're not going to get any benefits

627
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,798
from that

628
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,639
whatsoever i've tried it all i've had a

629
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:25,119
bunch of co2 meters

630
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,038
that i purchased to try it all

631
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,279
i wish i made more videos on it to tell

632
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:31,759
you the truth uh just so some people

633
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:34,079
weren't wasting their money on things

634
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,240
um because as soon as that fan comes on

635
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:37,599
you're pretty much euchred uh you lose

636
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,839
that co2

637
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,519
i agree i mean if you're exhausting you

638
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,079
know 24 7 like some people have their

639
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,480
airline fans on the entire time i do use

640
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:49,359
the tnb naturals i do have the canister

641
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,200
for tme naturals i've have a co2 monitor

642
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,119
as well which i've taken measurements

643
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,200
and it's built up past 1000 at some

644
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,038
points you know what i mean but i wasn't

645
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,200
exhausting 24 7. i was doing

646
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,839
intermittent exhausting right so i have

647
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,840
the ac infinity inline fan which is

648
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,678
hooked up to controller and i have set

649
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,480
points you know so if it goes over a

650
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,480
certain temperature it'll kick on

651
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,038
remove that hot air and then it will

652
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,880
turn off and same thing with humidity if

653
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:17,440
humidity rises too high

654
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,480
reaches that set point it'll turn off

655
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,960
and then

656
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,558
turn on exhaust and then turn off when

657
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,079
when it's below that set point so i feel

658
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,000
like in that case you can definitely get

659
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:29,359
away with like the co2 canisters and

660
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,759
stuff i also have the exhale 365 bags i

661
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:33,279
just started using that last month

662
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:34,720
and things are working out pretty good

663
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:36,960
so far with that the whole thing got

664
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,240
inoculated within a couple weeks so i

665
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,000
was a little bit surprised on that one

666
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,599
it's my first time using it but i

667
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,440
haven't done the co2 measurements on

668
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:44,639
that just yet but i do know a lot of

669
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,400
people that are running those with

670
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,559
success and they mentioned that they're

671
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,640
they're increasing their co2 levels

672
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,319
quite a bit with the bags and also with

673
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,640
the canisters but yeah i agree if you're

674
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:55,759
exhausting 24 7

675
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,919
probably don't want to spend the money

676
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:00,720
on co2 since that's probably just being

677
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,880
sucked out to grow space yeah

678
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,679
yeah exactly so exactly if you got your

679
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,760
fan off why not right and i haven't even

680
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,840
tried out those mushroom bags yet so uh

681
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,400
that might be something i try next just

682
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,319
to give it a shot see how it works

683
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,840
for sure for sure now what are you doing

684
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:19,918
for like air circulation and air

685
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:22,240
exchange oh i'm i'm hooked on ac

686
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,278
infinity everything pretty much so yeah

687
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,038
i i got their new fans early uh i don't

688
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,839
think the other ones come out until like

689
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:33,119
april or march or something

690
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:36,399
they do have fans on their website now

691
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,359
but that is just for the non-oscillating

692
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,559
ones

693
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:43,119
but what i do mostly is i run uh the ac

694
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:45,678
infinity fans or any other six inch fan

695
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:48,158
i used to have i'll typically have three

696
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,000
in each four by four tent uh i'll have

697
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,400
one like on the floor and then i'll have

698
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,880
one on a close pole to me and then one

699
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,840
on a fire pole i always like to tell

700
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,120
people

701
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:01,439
that uh airflow is key it's i cannot

702
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,599
praise that enough uh you want good air

703
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,320
flow you want air blowing around and

704
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:09,678
then i use of course uh the six inch

705
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:12,319
exhaust fan uh that i always change my

706
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,120
air in my tent uh when it's on the off

707
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:17,200
setting it's really at about two

708
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:19,599
the number two setting so it's always a

709
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,038
bit of airflow and uh it's usually up

710
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:25,359
around eight percent uh or setting

711
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,278
number eight uh exhausting during the

712
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,759
day in order to keep that temperature

713
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:32,319
down and flower or i could go to like

714
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:34,480
the sixth setting in veg or something

715
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:38,798
but uh for the most part i use ac

716
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,798
infinity uh everything for my indoor

717
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:42,480
indoor grow

718
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:45,119
i can't even say they've really come a

719
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,880
long way because they've always been

720
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,038
uh pretty much top-notch right like

721
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,120
they're fans it seems like everything

722
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:53,440
that they put out is just uh they're

723
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:54,959
hitting the nail on the head so yeah i

724
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,038
completely agree they've definitely

725
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,880
changed the game quite a bit uh you know

726
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:00,480
when it comes to their fans i mean that

727
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,400
was a major game changer with it hooked

728
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,759
up to the controller they didn't have

729
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,038
set points you know for temperature and

730
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:06,480
humidity now they've got that

731
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:09,359
oscillating fan that you mentioned i

732
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,278
told them because i i work with them too

733
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,879
i said send me over four of them so i

734
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,278
got four of them now

735
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,919
and i've been using those and my i like

736
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,440
to put at least two per grow tent in

737
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,278
case one were to die out because i've

738
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,679
had that happen before where i had one

739
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:26,240
of my inline fans die and i only had one

740
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,559
in the tent at the time so there was all

741
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,640
that stagnant air and it led to bud rot

742
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,558
and i had to throw away some colas that

743
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,880
encountered bud ra which was a freaking

744
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:37,918
disaster that's on my channel people can

745
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,240
can watch that and laugh at me there but

746
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,278
yeah ac infinity i i do the same thing

747
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,679
with

748
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:45,359
trying to get air flow below the plants

749
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,640
and also try to get air flow above the

750
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,479
plants as well kind of like through the

751
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,799
canopy i feel like it'll kind of work

752
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,480
its way down below the plants up through

753
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,798
the canopy and then of course if your

754
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,798
inline fan conducting is connected to

755
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:58,240
like the top part well then you're

756
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:00,639
you're getting that exhaust there and of

757
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,480
course having the rectangle intake vents

758
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,559
open like on your if you're using guru

759
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,519
tent for example is certainly key right

760
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:09,599
let's get into plant training next um so

761
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,200
what do you typically do for plant

762
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,759
training do you do anything like topping

763
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,519
lst super cropping anything like that

764
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:18,480
yeah i uh

765
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:20,960
i do a lot of main lining so i obviously

766
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,278
i do a lot of topping and uh

767
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,360
bending and low stress training so

768
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,599
uh main lining is one of my most

769
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:28,558
favorite ways to grow

770
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,959
so

771
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:33,440
so yeah i i just enjoy getting all that

772
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,000
energy to the top of the plants and uh

773
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,080
just dealing with uh big buds and colas

774
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,038
instead of little popcorn buds

775
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:43,439
and stuff so uh pretty much uh

776
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:46,158
any video you see of mine i will have a

777
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,759
mainline plant uh either here or there

778
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:52,559
uh in one of my tents but uh

779
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:55,519
but yeah anyway uh basically i i do it

780
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:58,879
all uh some some super cropping i will

781
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:01,519
do depending on uh if i get a a branch

782
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,200
maybe two too long that i wanna flatten

783
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:06,079
out the canopy or something i might

784
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,840
super crop or on my outdoor i will do

785
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:10,558
some super cropping i actually super

786
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:11,839
crop a couple of them real hard

787
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:14,079
last spring

788
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,199
and just to make all the other tops come

789
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:17,119
up so

790
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,278
i basically do it all when it comes to

791
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,359
training can you explain the main lining

792
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,038
process in more detail for those that

793
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:25,119
don't know what it is i mean from my

794
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:27,519
understanding you're letting it grow to

795
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:29,199
a certain node then you're topping then

796
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,558
you're letting those ones grow to a

797
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,080
certain node then you're topping again

798
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,558
can you explain in detail like how you

799
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:37,359
go about doing the main lining process

800
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:39,519
yeah so uh basically uh it's what you

801
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:42,558
just said you let it grow up to like uh

802
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:44,240
maybe the fourth node um you want your

803
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,480
plant to be like eight inches tall and

804
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,839
then you take off like uh four inches

805
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,759
right away or something you take it down

806
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,439
to like the fourth node you don't have

807
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:54,079
to do it that way you do lose a little

808
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,600
bit of bench time that way but i really

809
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,240
prefer to do that so that you get

810
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:00,798
stronger branching but once you top it

811
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,798
the first time

812
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:04,720
you top it you spread those branches

813
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:06,798
apart a little bit and then you remove

814
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,640
all the other bottom branches so then

815
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:09,918
you got your two mains coming out like

816
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,000
that

817
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,720
so then your next time you top these two

818
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,359
mains so you do uh two toppings you top

819
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,558
one on your right right on your left and

820
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:20,558
then uh

821
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:22,558
so then you got your four tops and four

822
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:25,440
mains coming off that with everything

823
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:27,359
else below removed so uh

824
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,120
then you would top your third time so

825
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,439
then you get eight tops so every time

826
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:33,599
you top you're pretty much doubling your

827
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,320
tops the amount of tops you have

828
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,398
uh i typically stop around eight

829
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,158
i am going to be doing one on this next

830
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,319
series i'm going to be doing one plant

831
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,679
to uh 16 tops

832
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:47,519
but um you would go uh like uh two tops

833
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,120
four tops eight tops

834
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,720
16 32

835
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:53,119
64.

836
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,880
there was one person who commented on my

837
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:57,879
uh channel saying that they did 120

838
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,079
some tops 128 tops so i wanted him to

839
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,839
send me pictures but he didn't reply

840
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:07,678
back to me after i replied to him so i

841
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,678
was interested in seeing that

842
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,080
would have been quite wild so

843
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,159
uh picking that up i might actually do

844
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:16,480
that this spring on an outdoor plant i

845
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,600
might do one with a ridiculous amount of

846
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,640
tops

847
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:21,199
but uh

848
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,600
sorry for the short version of how you

849
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,278
main line it's basically what you do is

850
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:27,199
you continue to top until you get as

851
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:28,480
many tops as you want

852
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,798
and then uh

853
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,960
anyway when you mainline

854
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:35,200
like i said before all of your

855
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,440
bud focuses to the top and

856
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,880
us instead of a bunch of branches

857
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,558
everywhere yeah because you're still

858
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,240
kind of doing that lollipop technique

859
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:44,319
where you're taking off the lower third

860
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,240
or lower fourth some people do and then

861
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:48,879
that helps focus it on top i think

862
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,319
mainlining the theory behind it

863
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,440
is that and i don't think anybody can

864
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:54,639
prove this

865
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,240
is that if you have equal distance

866
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,960
from the stock

867
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,278
to the colas then it's evenly

868
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,360
transporting nutrients up to the

869
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:04,720
branches right so like

870
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:06,479
if you look at the main line how it's

871
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,720
actually done all the branches are are

872
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,759
even right the the same exact distance

873
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,480
to where your colors start right i did a

874
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,839
little bit of a variation of main lining

875
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,519
basically what i did was i let it grow

876
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,759
to the fifth node

877
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,319
top down to the third node

878
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:24,240
left the second node branching

879
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,079
and removed i think i removed the first

880
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,798
node branching so basically right off

881
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,240
the bat i was able to have four branches

882
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:32,158
right off the bat you know now they're

883
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,919
not evenly branched the branches aren't

884
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,000
evenly distributed or whatever you want

885
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,600
to call it like but i found like it was

886
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,759
a little bit of a shortcut to the main

887
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:41,918
lining process and then i did do a top

888
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,119
so it's eight eight tops or eight main

889
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,278
colas

890
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:49,918
16 main colas topped again 32 bank colas

891
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,519
so 32 was the most i ever done

892
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,480
i personally felt like it was a little

893
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,759
bit of overkill for my situation because

894
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,798
i was trying to keep the plant at two

895
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:00,079
foot by two foot space so having 32 tops

896
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,000
on a plant i think i was in a three

897
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:03,599
gallon container too i felt like you

898
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,278
know i didn't get much of a stretch once

899
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:07,519
flipping over the flowers the plant was

900
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:08,319
small and you know because when you top

901
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,359
and you have all these different

902
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,439
branches

903
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,359
when you do that flip to flower and it

904
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,798
starts that stretching period well you

905
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:16,240
don't just have a few branches stretch

906
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:18,240
you have more branches stretching so

907
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,079
you're not really going to get as much

908
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,919
of a stretch most of the time right

909
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:23,599
generally speaking but yeah eight main

910
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,640
tops is typically what i go for

911
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,319
sometimes 16 main tops for me kind of

912
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,480
growing each plant a two foot by two

913
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:32,319
foot space so that's what i found works

914
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,839
well for me but i feel like there are so

915
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:35,599
many different ways to kind of go about

916
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:37,519
it and i always tell people to

917
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:39,599
experiment right try things out see what

918
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,440
you can do have fun with it so yeah

919
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:44,240
that's the thing with it right like uh

920
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,240
mainlining it puts you

921
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,038
you're so much hands on and i really

922
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,359
like uh i really enjoy training plants

923
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:54,079
and uh growing the plants it's not just

924
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:56,479
all about yield or how fast i could turn

925
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:59,119
over a grow it's like i enjoy the

926
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,960
training and doing what i do it's like i

927
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:04,239
don't want to rush it and get it all

928
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,759
knocked out in a couple weeks like uh i

929
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,599
will get a lot of people will comment to

930
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:10,398
be like oh that takes way too long it's

931
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:13,199
like in all reality uh main lining only

932
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:15,918
adds a week on to what i regular veg

933
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,159
anyway so like i regularly veg about

934
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,320
five weeks uh i'll go six weeks with the

935
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,000
main line right like it doesn't add all

936
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:24,158
that much more time

937
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,359
but uh it's what i enjoy to do if i

938
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,760
wanted to just knock them out of the

939
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:30,398
park i would just fill the tent with uh

940
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:32,319
six plants uh every time i grew and do

941
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:33,359
no training and just grow them fast

942
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:34,158
right

943
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:36,798
so

944
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,278
uh yeah being hands-on with your plants

945
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:41,599
is one of the most uh fun ways to do it

946
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:43,278
i find so that's what i'll continue to

947
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,759
do absolutely

948
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:48,079
i've seen you had some amazing success

949
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,839
with the scrub technique can you explain

950
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:52,158
your process there

951
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:53,839
yeah i got i've done a couple scrogs i

952
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,840
think this is one of the first ones i've

953
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:57,038
ever actually done on my channel

954
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:58,879
but uh

955
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:00,319
for the most part

956
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,960
i would have enjoyed to start off with

957
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:04,240
like two plants but i didn't know until

958
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,319
later on that i was going to be doing a

959
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,759
scrog so i did it with four plants kind

960
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:09,759
of happy i did that anyway because it

961
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:12,480
filled the canopy a little bit more

962
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,159
but i went from seed so it was up in the

963
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,599
air of like what kind of phenols i was

964
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,639
gonna get so i was a little worried

965
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,440
about that

966
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,079
but i ended up making it work

967
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,800
what i'll do is for hybrid strains i

968
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,119
will just keep tucking my branches under

969
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,200
uh i don't usually weave my branches

970
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,358
through because it's a to harvest

971
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,439
oh sorry what my language are but that's

972
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,358
all good painting

973
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,800
harvest that so what i'll do is i'll

974
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:38,878
just tuck all the branches right

975
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,200
underneath and they're all pushing up on

976
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:43,519
the scrog so then they gain their

977
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,358
support that way so uh then you just end

978
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:47,280
up with a bunch of tops

979
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:49,358
and uh you'll be good to go i'm in week

980
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,639
five now so if there's anyone interested

981
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,119
in seeing how

982
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,200
good scraw goes uh feel free to go check

983
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,800
out my channel because i'm just in week

984
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,319
five now we still have a few weeks of

985
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,079
that left to go

986
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,519
uh for most viewers it's the most

987
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,119
exciting part because we're starting to

988
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:06,400
put on all the bud

989
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,640
so uh that's uh it's bitties by soulfire

990
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,639
gardens and it's a real nice strain with

991
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,920
a real potent smell to it i'm really

992
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:13,519
excited about

993
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,440
so follow up question i have for you is

994
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:18,159
like some people swear that you should

995
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,519
do one top first and then it allows the

996
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,759
lower branches to come out and then

997
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:24,000
spread into that scrub net a little bit

998
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,200
easier and then also some people swear

999
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,800
by a certain height from the grow pot

1000
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:31,439
then that should be a certain height

1001
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,359
above that do you do a topping and then

1002
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,320
what is your distance from grill pot to

1003
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:38,400
net yeah uh you're right there uh i like

1004
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,240
to leave a distance about a foot

1005
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,000
so i'll get my plants to grow about a

1006
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:43,519
foot and then i'll toss toss them

1007
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,400
underneath the scrog or i'll put the

1008
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:47,519
scrog down and then i'll start to train

1009
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,200
from there

1010
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,119
really doesn't look like you're getting

1011
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:54,239
much out of it the first couple weeks it

1012
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,920
just looks like a plant bent over but

1013
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:57,598
it seems to be one of my

1014
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,599
a better way to do it

1015
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,599
and uh so i'm just trying to remember

1016
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:05,838
the second part to your question

1017
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:08,079
oh no i don't talk so uh no i don't uh

1018
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:10,159
i didn't top this time anyway uh next

1019
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,079
time maybe i will i switch it up here

1020
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:14,000
and there but for the most part no i

1021
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,400
just bent it over let all those branches

1022
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,199
come up and then uh continue to bend

1023
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,079
them over and underneath uh the scrog

1024
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:21,919
okay

1025
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,200
and then when actually went to your i

1026
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,400
saw this on your instagram is that

1027
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:26,159
you're using

1028
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,480
not your traditional scrub net it looks

1029
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:30,480
like it's like a clear plastic and

1030
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,400
they're not actually squares can you

1031
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,440
talk to us about what you're using there

1032
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,079
yeah i found that online so uh

1033
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,079
usually when i use like scrog netting

1034
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,000
i can't even say usually because i don't

1035
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,480
do it all that often really to tell you

1036
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,039
truth i've done it a few times now but

1037
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,880
uh usually i want like uh smaller

1038
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,480
squares i find it's easier to train with

1039
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,519
like smaller squares like three inch

1040
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,519
squares

1041
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:55,358
uh so what i was doing is i was looking

1042
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:56,239
for something that i could hook up to my

1043
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:59,519
uh

1044
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:01,039
gorilla grow tent the high cfm kit

1045
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:04,000
i don't know if you know those bars that

1046
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:06,559
go across in your uh

1047
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,280
tent that helps for the sectional sides

1048
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:11,519
anyway i was looking for uh i was

1049
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,640
looking for a scrog to attach that and i

1050
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:16,800
came across that other scroll online uh

1051
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:18,879
it's called the p-scrog i forget the

1052
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,560
name of the website but uh that's what

1053
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,240
i'm using there now

1054
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:24,159
and uh that's the plastic one i'm real

1055
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:26,799
happy with that it came with like uh the

1056
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:29,279
poles and uh it was easy to put together

1057
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,960
reusable washable and i don't have to

1058
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,640
worry about uh

1059
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,519
trying to untangle a messy net

1060
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:40,559
gotcha and then are you just doing one

1061
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:42,320
net or some people do like two layers

1062
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:45,838
some people do three layers

1063
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,760
yeah so that's what i i do right like uh

1064
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:49,679
i just do the one layer because what

1065
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,520
i'll do is i will uh

1066
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:54,639
i'll tuck until

1067
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:56,960
up to uh the first week of flowers over

1068
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,799
so that that's enough stability when

1069
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,159
those all those tops come up and put

1070
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,400
your buds there you're gonna get nice

1071
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:05,279
sized colas they're gonna end up far

1072
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,720
away from away from your light

1073
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,640
i don't know i just find it ends up

1074
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,639
perfect if you do your talking until the

1075
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,319
end of week one now that could change

1076
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,960
obviously if you're going with like a

1077
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,079
more sativa strain i would probably tuck

1078
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,760
until like maybe the end of week two uh

1079
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,680
really i would just watch that plant and

1080
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,720
see how it starts out stretching since i

1081
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:26,719
flip it from 1212 and i would just judge

1082
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:29,838
it from there but for the most part for

1083
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:31,919
like your indicas and your hybrids

1084
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:34,078
i suggest training them keep tucking

1085
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,119
them until your first week of flower is

1086
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,119
over

1087
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,760
and then you won't need that second

1088
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,960
screen to support your buds okay that's

1089
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,040
good to know

1090
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,800
how about defoliation you know a lot of

1091
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:46,639
people group this in

1092
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,640
to plant training

1093
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:51,279
some people call it pruning method right

1094
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:53,039
do you do any sort of defoliation if so

1095
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,760
what's your process for that

1096
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:58,079
so yeah if i'm uh if i'm just growing my

1097
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,760
plants normally say give them one

1098
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:04,880
topping or whatever i will do uh i'll do

1099
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,680
a good default maybe around a week

1100
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,358
four and a half five of uh veg just to

1101
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,000
keep all the airflow going make sure

1102
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:14,000
that all the bud sites and uh

1103
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,599
branches are gonna get light to them

1104
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,119
mostly for air flow i'm all about the

1105
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,240
airflow

1106
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:23,119
and then yeah so uh later on in flower

1107
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:26,000
about week three i will do another heavy

1108
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,599
default depending on how i grew them

1109
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,199
with the main lines you don't really

1110
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,359
need a default all that much because

1111
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:34,239
you're defauling as you go

1112
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:36,400
but uh but yeah when i do a default i

1113
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:39,279
sometimes i'll strip them right down uh

1114
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,838
depending on like the cultivar or i'll

1115
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,240
uh i'll be a little more easier on and

1116
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:46,639
then just select which ones i want uh

1117
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:49,519
with autos i will tuck most of time and

1118
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:51,759
just do selective defoliation i don't

1119
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:53,440
like to go real crazy with autos

1120
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,160
i learned my lesson with them a couple

1121
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,480
times from going too hard on them so for

1122
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:00,879
the most part i'll just tuck and

1123
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,159
remove the ones that absolutely need to

1124
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,480
be moved

1125
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:08,719
uh then sorry for uh then for in flower

1126
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,559
on photo periods like i said i'll do a

1127
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:13,358
strip in like week three

1128
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:16,000
but continuing out in flower all i'll do

1129
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:18,078
then is i'll just uh again i'll select

1130
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,239
uh certain leaves that are blocking bud

1131
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,480
sites that i'll remove the rest of the

1132
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:24,479
way through flour and now you mentioned

1133
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,079
super cropping you do that sometimes

1134
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,079
when did you say that you typically do

1135
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,480
it uh well i i don't do it all that

1136
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,318
often but i will do it like if i get a

1137
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,159
branch getting out of hand getting

1138
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:36,000
taller than the other ones then i'll

1139
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:37,440
super crop it just to bring it down and

1140
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,318
have it with uh

1141
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,838
flat note the canopy or on my outdoor

1142
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:43,838
grows uh

1143
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:46,159
when i'm starting out outdoors sometimes

1144
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:47,679
i'll just give it a hardcore super crop

1145
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:49,199
break that thing right in half we'll

1146
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:50,879
bend it right in half

1147
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,159
so that all the other bottom branches

1148
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,000
come up to uh start filling

1149
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:57,679
start filling like the fencing that i

1150
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,358
put around my plants

1151
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:02,000
outdoors so

1152
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:04,400
sometimes i do it sometimes i won't

1153
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,920
again it just depends

1154
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,680
yeah i think the only time i really do

1155
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,960
super cropping is when

1156
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,960
you know i've flipped the plants to

1157
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,039
flowering and i'm having trouble

1158
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,400
controlling the stretch right because

1159
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:15,599
some of these phenos they're just going

1160
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,000
to stretch

1161
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,480
way beyond your expectation right i had

1162
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,199
a phenol frozen fuel

1163
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,079
by squealing genetics shut off thc titan

1164
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:28,639
it stretched three times the amount

1165
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,200
it was in vegetation stage so i was like

1166
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:33,679
blown away i almost ran out of height

1167
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:35,759
and yeah that in particular if i was

1168
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:37,118
running out of height or you know maybe

1169
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,800
i'm doing the scrub technique or

1170
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,318
whatever and some branches are higher

1171
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,839
than others that's when i'll do the

1172
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:44,239
super cropping technique for the most

1173
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:46,159
part i know pigeons he does super

1174
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:48,000
cropping he swears by this

1175
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:49,920
every single one of his branches and

1176
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,920
when they're small and he swears by it

1177
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,680
and he has a lot of success doing that

1178
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,440
so it's something i haven't tried yet

1179
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:57,279
but i've been wanting to try i think

1180
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,119
maybe this round next time around i'm

1181
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,720
gonna have to try to super drop every

1182
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,000
every branch and see if it can build up

1183
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:04,879
some strength see if it actually does

1184
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,719
work or not yeah i find if uh with your

1185
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,079
branches if you like mess around with

1186
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,519
them right make them feel like they're

1187
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,920
out in nature

1188
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:13,759
uh bend them around and stuff just to

1189
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,079
strengthen them up i find that beefs

1190
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,480
them up a bit that and some good silica

1191
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,079
but i've never super cropped every

1192
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,838
single branch no

1193
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,839
yeah it's definitely a unique technique

1194
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,759
that's for sure yeah he's always had a

1195
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:27,920
pretty unique way of growing like his

1196
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,839
training's always been pretty heavy

1197
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,920
ever since like i started watching him

1198
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,960
maybe like four years ago

1199
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,880
uh

1200
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,000
yeah he's always uh he always did some

1201
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,920
real heavy training i know that lost a

1202
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,679
lot of those videos were lost i think

1203
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,920
when he lost his channel

1204
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:46,559
but uh yeah he used to have a real lot

1205
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,318
of uh good training episodes on there so

1206
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:49,838
we covered a lot in this episode you

1207
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:52,639
know we went over lighting went over

1208
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:55,358
environment we went over plant training

1209
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:56,879
what advice do you have for new growers

1210
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:58,400
and we went over so much information

1211
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,760
there are some folks that are brand new

1212
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,639
that just starting that might consider

1213
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,400
this

1214
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:03,838
overwhelming to hear this type of

1215
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,039
information

1216
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:06,000
a lot of people just want to keep it

1217
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:08,000
simple

1218
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,239
what advice do you have for people who

1219
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,719
are just starting out

1220
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:15,279
have fun with it don't let it stress you

1221
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,358
out at all uh and if you plan on

1222
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,280
starting like a youtube channel don't

1223
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:21,598
stress about that either like uh your

1224
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,680
subscribers will come but uh for the

1225
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,559
most part do not stress about growing

1226
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:29,519
it's all gonna come with you uh watch a

1227
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,960
lot of videos uh try to only like do one

1228
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:33,280
thing at a time

1229
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,519
uh don't try to uh

1230
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,160
show a master gardener or have a master

1231
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:40,000
garden try to like grow that one plant

1232
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,799
first see how you can do with that and

1233
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,760
then upscale i say start with the basics

1234
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,280
get a

1235
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,119
a good light is always key of course uh

1236
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,359
then you could need some fans and stuff

1237
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,318
but just start with the basics uh start

1238
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:56,719
with like a basic nutrient line as well

1239
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:58,880
and uh just take it easy don't get

1240
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:00,719
stressed out don't get mad at yourself

1241
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,720
and uh you're not growing to impress

1242
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:04,559
anyone else it's another thing i try to

1243
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:06,799
tell people like i have no one to

1244
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,960
impress either to you you have no one to

1245
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,039
impress just throw your herb and have

1246
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:14,000
fun doing it well said

1247
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:16,159
well said for sure so wrapping things up

1248
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,960
how can listeners find you and what do

1249
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:20,960
you have upcoming in the future i uh

1250
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,039
well i have my youtube channel rose of

1251
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,760
green that's my main one then i have a

1252
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:28,480
backup channel uh it's more or less of a

1253
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,880
it's called rog growtek uh it's where i

1254
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,119
show off like lights and fans i just do

1255
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,920
reviews of products on there

1256
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,920
and then of course i have my instagram

1257
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,000
rose of green 420

1258
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,800
and uh something new that i'm doing is

1259
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,480
uh

1260
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,800
i've been dabbling in the breeding for

1261
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,960
the last couple years and uh i'm going

1262
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,240
to be releasing a strain here shortly in

1263
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,760
the next

1264
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:52,639
month or so

1265
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,599
it's called rewind it's a cross of uh

1266
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:58,400
granddaddy purple and og kush breath

1267
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,079
so uh you can check that out uh go to

1268
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,599
just follow my channel along and i'll

1269
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,280
show you where you can find them because

1270
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:07,599
i can't really spit it out on here

1271
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,599
without uh youtube getting angry

1272
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,359
that cultivar you mentioned is it a f1

1273
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:13,679
f2

1274
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:14,480
3 what is it so i brought it to enough

1275
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:16,239
too

1276
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,159
i

1277
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:19,759
i found a really nice granddaddy purple

1278
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:21,440
a couple years ago so i've used that in

1279
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,319
a couple of good crosses

1280
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,480
uh and then i found a real nice og kush

1281
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:29,440
breath so i made the cross there

1282
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,280
and then uh again i found a couple nice

1283
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,159
sister and brother so i turned it into

1284
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,400
an f2 and then i just made uh the

1285
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:38,639
feminized version of it i made some s1

1286
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,039
so i'm going to be releasing the regular

1287
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,440
seeds and the feminized seeds together

1288
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:44,960
awesome good stuff there

1289
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,960
well i will definitely have a link to
