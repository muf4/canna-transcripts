1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,000
coming up on garden talk

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,160
so like when you look at soils or like

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,160
pro-mix hp the pro-mix high porosity

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,839
with mycorrhizae it has almost no

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,599
mycorrhizae in it because they put it in

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:12,879
it like a per yard rate and it's really

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,880
small to begin with but they have

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,719
mycorrhizae on the label microbes are

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,719
able to act like a buffer and they're

10
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,399
able to deliver nutrition at much wider

11
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,719
ranges of ph especially when you have a

12
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,320
good consortia or breakdown of the

13
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,679
different microbes that are in there a

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,839
lot of people don't realize with amino

15
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,079
acids if they're not in their l form

16
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,479
they are not plant available at all so

17
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,920
like it has to be l amino acids or your

18
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,238
plants not going to be able to utilize

19
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,399
them at all they actually make compounds

20
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,878
that help the plant be able to have a

21
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,879
more like fibrous and dense root system

22
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,640
the bacillus and the different types of

23
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,159
trichodermal fungi that can be in there

24
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,079
are going to be the ones that are doing

25
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,599
the majority of the work for everything

26
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,600
while mycorrhizae gets all the fame

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,440

microbes so much to talk about

117
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,199
tell us a little bit about yourself and

118
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,358
how you got into gardening

119
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,358
uh so i mean it started when i was

120
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,039
really young uh my grandmother got me

121
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,519
into gardening and one of my

122
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,520
grandfathers was also a master gardener

123
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,198
growing up so i mean it just plants were

124
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,198
always around my mom has a beautiful

125
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,000
garden um and it was just always

126
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,160
something that interests me a lot um

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,240
plants are really cool and i

128
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,240
specifically like to take a much more

129
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,879
science-approached or science-backed

130
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,400
approach to medicinal herb gardening for

131
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,879
sure nice

132
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,399
and so you decided to you join the dude

133
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,839
grow show how did that all come about if

134
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,120
you don't mind me asking how did you

135
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:53,439
kind of join the team there and that was

136
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,160
in 2017 right uh 2016. um it's when i

137
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,879
first moved out to colorado i had met up

138
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,120
with scott a couple years earlier um

139
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,839
they had been talking about black dog

140
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,759
led and saying that there's no good leds

141
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,000
out there they're all blurples and stuff

142
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,840
and at the time i was in uh in school

143
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,399
and designing and building my own led

144
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:15,758
lights and selling them to some people

145
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:18,079
uh ended up not going along that path uh

146
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,759
but i got in touch with scott and was

147
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,918
like hey you guys are giving people

148
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,800
really bad advice about this leds are

149
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,478
the future uh hps is like a thing of the

150
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,759
past this is something you need to talk

151
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:29,680
about you need to let people know that

152
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,840
there's uh good information on this out

153
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,319
there and there are good leds out there

154
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:37,519
that far surpass what or what hps could

155
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,599
do so scott flew me out to

156
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,279
uh one of the cups came hung out with

157
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,199
them for a while decided i was gonna

158
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,638
move out to colorado i was still in

159
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,879
school at the time and

160
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,478
moved out and then scott had a job for

161
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,240
me right away and started getting

162
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,918
rolling with the dude grow show that's

163

you dude scotty and you guys just flow

167
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,879
so well together it's pretty cool i

168
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,038
actually hear that a lot with on my

169
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,680
podcast from the stash with me rob

170
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,279
kendrick's lifestyle tv and pigeons420 i

171
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,280
feel like it's similar you guys just

172
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,559
flow so well together it's awesome and i

173
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,638
actually do it

174
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,399
i was going to say we're all uh and you

175
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,319
guys too we're all really good foils for

176
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,879
each other um everyone has different

177
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,280
approaches to things and it's cool to

178
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,038
get those different ideas uh for so as a

179
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,399
listener to be able to listen to that

180
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,038
and be able to make your own decision

181
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,000
off of stuff and hear just a variety of

182
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:31,839
ideas

183
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,680
well said i do have a few numbers here

184
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,918
you guys have on the dude gross channel

185
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,120
over 67 000 subscribers

186
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:41,519
1892 videos

187
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,759
over 9.3 million views combined so you

188
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,279
guys have been very successful and uh

189
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,479
definitely thank you for your efforts

190
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,638
there and i'm excited to see what you

191
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,639
guys got in the future thank you yeah it

192
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,240
was really cool to be able to like i

193
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,160
grew up in virginia where i mean

194
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,160
everything related to medicinal

195
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,560
gardening was super hush-hush

196
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,800
um and getting out here and being able

197
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,879
to be on a youtube show and share some

198
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,120
knowledge with people and get everyone

199
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:05,918
uh just growing better has been really

200
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,759
cool

201
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,399
living the dream

202
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,400
right and helping people which is uh

203
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,079
like one of my favorite things to do in

204
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,399
educating them and helping them at the

205
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,719
same time and then like my favorite

206
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,159
thing is hearing a new grower get back

207
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,639
in touch with us say they found the

208
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,319
podcast or the youtube show and they got

209
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,038
their first harvest and it was awesome

210
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,080
and how happy they are that that

211
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,318
gets me

212
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,719
super rewarding absolutely

213
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,160
before we get deep into specific

214
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,400
microbes

215
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,680
tell us what are microbial inoculants

216
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,959
and how are they beneficial in the

217
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,400
garden

218
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,079
so there's a couple different ways that

219
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,000
those microbial inoculants are going to

220
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,000
be beneficial in the garden first and

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,079
foremost they act as root growth

222
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,240
promoting rhizobacteria where they

223
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,159
actually make compounds that help the

224
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,400
plant be able to have a more like

225
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,759
fibrous and dense root system

226
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,839
which i mean we've all heard it before

227
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,439
more roots more fruits and just an

228
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,679
overall healthier plant they can absorb

229
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,519
more nutrition because plants can only

230
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,879
absorb nutrition from the tips of the

231
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,719
root

232
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,560
and these plant growth

233
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,280
plant growth promoting rhizobacter are

234
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,839
able to get more tips around by growing

235
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,159
out more tertiary and secondary roots

236
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,679
but at the same time those bacteria have

237
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,759
evolved over

238
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,360
millions of years in a symbiotic

239
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,199
relationship with the plant where not

240
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,560
only do they do that the plant puts out

241
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,879
carbohydrates

242
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,879
as exudates to feed them and kind of

243
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,879
control the microbial population that's

244
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,719
there so that it can uh like

245
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,120
exponentially increase the surface area

246
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,680
of its root zone and just those microbes

247
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,759
are able to break down nutrient um get

248
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,519
it into an ionic form and hold on to it

249
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,759
until the plant signals that it needs it

250
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,839
and then they can get it to the plant

251
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,600
and none of that is it

252
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,240
that that's all as far as like plant

253
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,159
nutrition and plant growth um they also

254
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,080
put up like a no vacancy sign to

255
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,240
pathogens they would normally get into

256
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,000
your your garden and there'd be room for

257
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,360
them to grow and expand and that's when

258
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,278
you end up with something like pythium

259
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,440
or phytothera

260
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,278
those really bad root diseases but when

261
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,480
you have good beneficial microbes in

262
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:11,039
there uh they are making compounds that

263
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,680
uh make it not a hospitable environment

264
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,278
for those uh bad actors um and also just

265
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,120
puts up the no vacancy sign telling them

266
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:19,519
like hey there's no room for you here

267
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,399
man go somewhere else that's pretty cool

268
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,320
that makes sense now some folks i think

269
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,519
it's pretty well known you know if

270
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,600
you're a beginner you might not know

271
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,360
this but a lot of folks that are above

272
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,399
the beginner stage intermediate stage

273
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,720
know that

274
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,159
there are synthetic nutrients that are

275
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,759
plant available they're already in a

276
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,759
form that the plant can uptake then

277
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,159
there are organic nutrients

278
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,319
which need to be broken down by microbes

279
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,759
first and that's where microbes are

280
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,120
especially important you know having

281
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,879
these different microbial inoculants

282
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,519
adding them into the medium to help with

283
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,278
that breakdown process is key on the

284
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,959
organic side of things now there's some

285
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,278
folks out there that are going to say

286
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,759
well i'm using synthetic bottled

287
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:00,159
nutrients or mineral based salt based

288
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,759
whatever you want to call it

289
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,759
microbes aren't going to be beneficial

290
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,000
for me at all can you give us your

291
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,240
thoughts on that is that true or not or

292
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,159
well first and foremost definitely not

293
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,720
true i hear this all the time and it's

294
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,000
one of the big myths in gardening

295
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,800
especially in that

296
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,879
synthetic style of gardening uh

297
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,120
those nutrients there's a big problem

298
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:24,879
with them just washing away or they're

299
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,959
being uh like ph lockout in the soil um

300
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,639
microbes are able to act like a buffer

301
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,719
and they're able to deliver nutrition at

302
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,799
much wider ranges of ph especially when

303
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,399
you have a good consortia or breakdown

304
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,679
of the different microbes that are in

305
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,639
there um so yeah i mean you

306
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,639
microbes are key and in synthetic

307
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,639
it is important to note that like

308
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,799
endogenous microorganisms ones that are

309
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,199
just in your yard in the backyard or in

310
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,519
your compost when you brew a compost tea

311
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,200
most of those don't persist

312
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,240
that great in like an agricultural

313
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,920
horticultural system um just the higher

314
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,919
salinity environments much more

315
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,199
environmental stress on those microbial

316
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,240
populations

317
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,440
but one of the cool things about

318
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,079
microbes is you can go through

319
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,640
successive generations of breeding them

320
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:10,239
really quickly and kind of select for

321
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,078
the environment that you want to be in

322
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,039
and not all microbes are created equal

323
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:14,399
you can kind of think of them like

324
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,120
technology products

325
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,799
um where someone's bacillus subtilis uh

326
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,799
it might say this exact same thing on

327
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,039
the label that is bacillus subtilis but

328
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:26,399
there can be a wide variety of like

329
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,679
different strains of them um and how uh

330
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,078
the different environments that they're

331
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,078
able to operate in our so i mean you can

332
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,159
have one thing on one label one on

333
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,679
another but like one might work way

334
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,439
better because it's been designed to

335
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,000
operate in like that higher salinity

336
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,399
environment containerized gardening uh

337
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,399
like high turnover crops where like you

338
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,120
really want to get the best growth you

339
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,039
possibly can uh as early on and through

340
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,039
the entire life cycle of the plant so

341
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:53,519
it's definitely still beneficial even if

342
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:56,319
you're using synthetic nutrients

343
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,159
in an ionized form it's still beneficial

344
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,639
to have microbes to use microbial

345
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,319
inoculants oh most definitely because

346
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,200
another cool thing they're able to do

347
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,278
it's called adsorbing uh the microbes do

348
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,720
kind of the same thing soil particles do

349
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:12,720
uh when ionic nutrients flow through it

350
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,399
those nutrients absorb onto soil

351
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,480
particles and then are kind of stuck

352
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,720
there until a root comes along with a

353
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,639
higher affinity to that ion that's stuck

354
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,639
to the soil particle

355
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,039
microbes kind of act like in that same

356
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,879
way where they can absorb this nutrition

357
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:28,480
and then be able to hold on to it in a

358
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,958
plant-available form and deliver it to

359
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,639
the plant so you don't you can when

360
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,239
you're using good microbes you're able

361
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,600
to cut back on your nutrients too just

362
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,839
because you're more efficiently and

363
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,159
effectively getting that into the plant

364
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,160
that's so cool that's really interesting

365
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,240
so yeah i mean the big big myth that we

366
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,399
hear all the time and uh

367
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,320
it's taken a lot of education for people

368
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,759
to be like no no no like you still need

369
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,639
to use it and that's just talking about

370
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:55,039
in terms of plant nutrition um as a

371
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,320
bioprotectant in the soil and prevent

372
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,240
especially if you're in hydroponics

373
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,680
preventing pythium and phypothera i

374
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,440
don't know if you've ever had those in

375
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,958
the garden um

376
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,320
if you're in a hydroponic system and

377
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,159
it's connected together like on a

378
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,639
central reservoir that can wipe out an

379
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:10,240
entire garden in a day and a half um

380
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,720
where it turns all your roots your

381
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,839
pearly white roots to just mush

382
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,839
um and a good way around not ever having

383
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,920
to deal with that is using good microbes

384
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,440
in there that act as a bioprotectant in

385
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,599
the soil or in whatever media you're

386
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,720
using so the idea is kind of like pest

387
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,399
management um but with these pathogens

388
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,399
where get the good microbes in there

389
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,278
inhabiting the root zone so that when

390
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,440
pithium of hypothyroid shows up uh it

391
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,879
never has a chance to even take hold the

392
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,880
good microbes are just there and out

393
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,559
compete it um for the same resources in

394
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,320
the same space what about hydrogen

395
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:46,559
peroxide i heard that as a remedy for it

396
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,040
that is one of the remedies uh kind of

397
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,399
going with the old uh style of thinking

398
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:53,198
on things where like i need to keep

399
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:56,399
everything as sterile as i possibly can

400
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,838
like a operating room at a hospital um

401
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,919
and i mean the same thing kind of

402
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,199
happens in operating rooms and hospitals

403
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:06,319
uh they have pan resistant uh bacteria

404
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:08,240
um that just like no antibiotics work on

405
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,240
uh you get into that where like if

406
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,240
you're just always sterilizing things

407
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,399
nature's not sterile and it's really

408
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,480
hard really really hard to keep things

409
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,360
sterile especially a plant and you're

410
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,519
losing all of the good uh

411
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,600
like bio protection features of good uh

412
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,600
microbial consortium living in the root

413
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,639
zone because hydrogen peroxide's gonna

414
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,800
kill

415
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,600
whatever microorganisms you have good

416
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,679
and

417
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,000
good ain't good and bad it'll just murk

418
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,439
them all um and it's kind of the same

419
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,839
thing have you ever noticed people that

420
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,480
like going really heavy antibiotics

421
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,760
uh they're not the same like initially

422
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,000
afterwards you have to eat a lot of

423
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,559
yogurt and probiotics were like it just

424
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,320
wiped out your gut microbiome seventy

425
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,958
percent of your immune system is in your

426
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,360
gut microbiome and like it's ex

427
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,958
extremely uh necessary for your your

428
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,600
health and everything there's a direct

429
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:59,838
connection uh just to analogize people

430
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,000
to plants um

431
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,160
our intestines are like our root system

432
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,919
um where they're inhabited by our

433
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,360
microbiome that lives in there they help

434
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,078
break stuff down and deliver the

435
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,639
nutrition to us your gut is connected

436
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,399
directly to your vagus nerve uh all the

437
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,680
way straight to your brain um and

438
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,639
they're starting to find more and more

439
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,319
that the

440
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,879
consortia or the proportions of

441
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,480
different microbes that are in your gut

442
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,799
can have a huge turn-on effect for more

443
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,440
than just like your gut health like

444
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,799
there's certain ones that uh

445
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,399
like they're starting to find like might

446
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,399
have more to do with like anxiety and

447
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,639
depression or different mental disorders

448
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,639
are really just uh an imbalance in your

449
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,399
gut microbiome wow that's really

450
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,959
interesting and then kind of sticking to

451
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,559
the topic of the amount of microbes

452
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,879
let's talk about cfu

453
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,399
colony forming units so i've got some

454
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,078
recharge right here i've got a microbial

455
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,078
inoculant recharge

456
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:54,000
it says what the microbe is and then

457
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:55,519
next to it it says for example 6.4 cfu

458
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,440
slash g

459
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,919
so what is what does that mean what is a

460
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,199
colony what is cfu colony farming unit

461
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:02,479
why should growers care about it when

462
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:03,679
they're shopping for microbial

463
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,600
inoculants

464
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,638
so colonel colony

465
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,839
colony forming units or cfus uh that's

466
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,320
in a per gram ratio um so that's how

467
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,000
many different uh like actual spores of

468
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,160
that and generally it's just used for

469
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,559
the mycorrhizae that's in there but how

470
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,879
many uh active growing spores are in

471
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:26,078
each gram and are able to uh start to

472
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:28,399
inoculate and uh grow along the route so

473
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,719
the the more the higher the number of cf

474
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,720
use you have uh the more of the actual

475
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,720
spores that are in there um and it's not

476
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,720
usually a like necessary thing to be on

477
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,560
there so like when you look at soils or

478
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,360
like pro-mix hp the pro-mix high

479
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,198
porosity with mycorrhizae uh it has

480
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,039
almost no mycorrhizae in it because they

481
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:46,559
put it in it like a per yard rate and

482
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:48,480
it's really small to begin with but they

483
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,399
have mycorrhizae on the label where it's

484
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,639
something else like recharge uh we have

485
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,399
a ton of mycorrhizae in there and not

486
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,278
just uh

487
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,759
it is a blend of endo and ecto um for

488
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:02,399
short day flowering plants uh we do run

489
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,480
into ecto is really meant for trees like

490
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,798
christmas trees is a really good example

491
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,078
um where it branches out away from the

492
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:12,798
plant um ecto meaning it's it's outside

493
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,159
of uh they've had different studies and

494
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,160
stuff where they had like a whole

495
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,919
commercial christmas tree farm

496
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,798
and they decided to put a fence around

497
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,559
it uh that fence when they did it they

498
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,240
like cut through the ground

499
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,558
um

500
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,200
it was surrounded by a forest they cut

501
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:31,038
off that christmas tree farm from its

502
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,000
mycorrhizal network to the force that's

503
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:36,000
around it and when it did that it uh

504
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
it put the whole christmas tree into the

505
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,160
christmas tree farm in decline um

506
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,400
because that mycorrhizal network was

507
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,840
using the forest around it to support

508
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,960
those trees growing there not

509
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:46,240
necessarily that they had all the

510
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,480
nutrients they needed right where they

511
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,720
were but the force was able to support

512
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,279
that and when they put that fence in it

513
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,120
cut it off from everything and they

514
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,558
like drastically noticed that their

515
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,479
force was going or their christmas tree

516
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:01,279
farm was going into decline

517
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,720
that's insane that's so crazy

518
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,399
uh i want to bring it back to what you

519
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,160
said which you had mentioned that there

520
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,798
was a product that has mycorrhizae on it

521
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,558
but it's like barely anything right so

522
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,519
i've actually interviewed somebody on

523
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,279
this podcast before and and this person

524
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,759
had said that some products on the

525
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,519
market today don't have enough cfus to

526
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,599
actually be effective i want to kind of

527
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,279
highlight that point that there could be

528
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,678
some products out there

529
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:28,399
where they're on the label but there's

530
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,559
really not enough amount to be effective

531
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,880
now when we go through these individual

532
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,399
microbes here i don't know i'm kind of

533
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,039
kind of putting you under the gun here

534
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,038
if you have any information on

535
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,200
what cfu should be for each of these

536
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:42,480
microbes as we go through of it please

537
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,200
you know let us know so we're not

538
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,720
getting ripped off here oh for sure

539
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,080
generally it's look for the highest

540
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,319
numbers you can find um just uh in my

541
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,639
opinion having more good microbes in

542
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,319
there like those uh those populations

543
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,640
will figure themselves out once they're

544
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,639
in the soil um and into that environment

545
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,919
where they actually start to uh get

546
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,640
selected for the environment that

547
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,880
they're in um but yeah generally just a

548
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,640
bigger number is better in this case

549
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,160
and so we don't really need to worry

550
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,360
about like a balance we don't have to

551
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,440
like look at the back of the label and

552
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,279
say well this only has this cfus but

553
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,279
this has a lot higher and it might throw

554
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,000
off the diversity do we have to worry

555
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,160
about that so that's so like labeling

556
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,038
with things uh

557
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,798
is a big game that you have to play uh

558
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,720
the back of labels it's almost always

559
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,038
even your your fertilizers that you buy

560
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,279
where it'll have like 20 20 20 on the

561
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:34,240
side of it um that's a guaranteed

562
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,480
minimum

563
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,240
um that's not necessarily saying like

564
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,279
the exact proportion of everything

565
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,359
that's in there um so it's

566
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,359
it's so hard and like soil they don't

567
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:46,639
have to list the ingredients in order of

568
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:48,479
what's in there the most they put

569
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,160
mycorrhizae first then list everything

570
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,839
else because they think people will just

571
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,120
think it's the same rules for food where

572
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,558
like the thing that's in there and the

573
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,079
highest amount is in there so i mean

574
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:01,038
it's kind of hard without actually

575
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:03,199
trying stuff um or getting it tested is

576
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,879
even better to see uh like what it

577
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,400
actually tests out at

578
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,159
wow i didn't know that about yeah i

579
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,919
thought the order was in just like food

580
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,120
i thought the order it was in was the

581
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,520
most amount

582
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,359
yeah no it's it's all a game of

583
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,759
guaranteed minimums on those things so

584
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,959
that makes it like as the end consumer i

585
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,558
could deal with it all the time with

586
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,640
regulatory bodies and stuff but the end

587
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,798
consumer it's really hard to look at

588
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,400
something and just like uh by the back

589
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:30,079
of it be able to know if like one if

590
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,000
that is completely truthful um or yeah

591
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,960
it's it just makes it really difficult i

592
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,839
can't say with recharge uh everything is

593
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,759
in there

594
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,678
far exceeds what we have on the label

595
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,960
that was like we we just put a lower

596
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,880
number on there to be safe with

597
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,640
everything there's a lot more of uh

598
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,159
those microbes in there uh when you

599
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,759
actually get it tested

600
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,919
gotcha just to touch on recharge real

601
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,599
quick so that's a microbial inoculant

602
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,240
it's got a whole bunch of different

603
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,158
things in there um a long bunch of

604
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,200
beneficial microbes along with like kelp

605
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,760
molasses humic acids fulvic acids amino

606
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,000
acids we we really like to think about

607
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,839
that more uh there's a lot of microbial

608
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,079
inoculants out there this one comes

609
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,639
together uh like a really good instant

610
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,798
compost tea where not only does it have

611
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,320
the uh wide range of bacillus in there

612
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,000
that are targeted at horticulture and

613
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,000
agricultural systems it's got the

614
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,079
trichoderma fungi

615
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,839
molasses is a food stock for everything

616
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,158
they're built on kelp as a carrier it's

617
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,759
got the l amino acids and a lot of

618
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,919
people don't realize with amino acids if

619
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,960
they're not in their l form they are not

620
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,280
plant available at all um so like it has

621
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,759
to be l amino acids or your plants not

622
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:37,359
going to be able to utilize them at all

623
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,759
and then humic and fulvic acids which

624
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,759
just act as like chelators

625
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,279
so they help

626
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,119
the microbes be able to do their job a

627
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,639
little bit more effectively so

628
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,079
not only are the chelators they act as

629
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,440
kind of catalyst for biological

630
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:50,798
reactions too

631
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,360
where they lower the energy of

632
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:55,119
activation needed to start a reaction so

633
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,918
that it's just a more efficient

634
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:00,639
metabolism going on in there gotcha and

635
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:03,038
just for trans transparency purposes

636
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,159
what's your affiliation with recharge

637
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:09,038
uh i am uh an operations manager over at

638
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,640
recharge so yeah i do have to

639
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:12,798
represent just being just being

640
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,200
transparent yeah exactly yeah i do work

641
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,960
for them yep yep no makes sense but it

642
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,960
is a great product something i use in my

643
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,798
garden off and on like i mentioned in

644
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,558
scotty's episode is like

645
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,679
i try to switch things up for my viewers

646
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:25,918
you know and i have to do the same thing

647
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,600
over and over again viewers get bored so

648
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:31,919
every once in a while i'll kick in some

649
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:34,158
recharge but i love it so it's very nice

650
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,120
now let's get into some of the

651
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,520
individual microbes you have

652
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,759
knowledge on quite a bit of them let's

653
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:42,798
start with uh tragoderma wanna talk to

654
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:44,798
us about that

655
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:46,400
okay trichoderma is one of my favorite

656
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:48,960
ones um

657
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,519
it is a voracious decomposer um it's

658
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,000
probably the class i would put it in uh

659
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,679
like it it's origin story of where

660
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,599
trichoderma actually started comes from

661
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,519
a single point of contact in the south

662
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,639
pacific during world war ii

663
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:02,079
um

664
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,240
they had set up camp somewhere like in

665
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,319
the the monsoon season uh in the south

666
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,079
pacific believe in the philippines they

667
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,000
had wax canvas tint everywhere like at

668
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,599
that time that's what everyone was using

669
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,359
they had set up camp

670
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,439
within three days

671
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,279
their wax canvas tents which are

672
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,360
extremely waterproof and just resistant

673
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,480
to anything going on environmentally uh

674
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:24,399
started literally melting away and it's

675
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,319
because they had come into contact with

676
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,720
some trichoderma fungi

677
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:30,720
that was collected as a sample brought

678
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,798
back to labs and then a lot of work has

679
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,319
been done with it since then

680
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,079
it's used in a lot of industrial

681
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,000
processes that like never really get

682
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,079
mentioned it's used in stone washing

683
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,200
genes

684
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,359
trying to think of something else that's

685
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,919
used in but in gardening they found out

686
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:48,000
that uh it is able to really really

687
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,840
really uh quickly

688
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,839
break down those organic nutrients that

689
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:53,439
you'd be putting into your soil um so

690
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:57,199
that they are able to get to a plant

691
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:00,159
available form much faster um and yeah i

692
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,558
mean it it also is very competitive um

693
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,559
with other fungi that are around um and

694
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,639
is able to out-compete uh most of the

695
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,798
pathogenic ones um that it's gonna come

696
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,919
into contact with and so

697
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:14,158
there are different strains of it um

698
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,400
just kind of looking at recharge

699
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,200
it's uh let's see what you got you got

700
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,440
trichoderma reese i'm gonna butcher

701
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,159
these names by the way so fair warning

702
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,519
these names are easily uh be able to be

703
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,520
butchered trichoderma horizon

704
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,400
perezium

705
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:34,639
horazinium

706
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,000
i struggle with that one too

707
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,960
do you have anything to add like on

708
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,839
those specific types of strains uh it's

709
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,319
not

710
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,639
it's not super necessary to go into like

711
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:47,839
uh the specific strains of those just

712
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,759
that trichoderma is like a class uh it

713
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:53,038
is very quick at breaking stuff down

714
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:55,599
especially organic nutrients um it it's

715
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,038
uh like a single celled fungi so it's

716
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,719
not uh where it's gonna have like

717
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,119
mushrooms growing off the top of it or

718
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,960
anything like that but it really is able

719
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,038
to get in there and it's good for bio

720
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,120
protection um and preventing any of

721
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:10,400
those root pathogens from popping up

722
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:12,239
okay gotcha another one that uh bacillus

723
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,759
you know let's move on to that i see

724
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,079
bacillus in almost every single one of

725
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,119
the micro products that i that i have

726
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,879
and um

727
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:20,879
looks like you guys got three different

728
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,600
strains of them is that right strains

729
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,080
different strains of them oh yeah yeah

730
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:28,399
strains of them um talk to us about

731
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:30,240
bacillus so bacillus is really cool it

732
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,798
is one of the

733
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,679
like real turn-on effects uh

734
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,278
in microbial inoculants um most people

735
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,600
give the credit to michael rizzi and

736
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:41,440
that's been like a buzzword for years in

737
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:44,000
gardening uh most people don't realize

738
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,159
that ecto-mycorrhizae can't even infect

739
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,319
short-day flowering plants um or the

740
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,600
medicinal plants people like to grow uh

741
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:50,720
it just doesn't have enough time to get

742
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,678
in there and start to build up that

743
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,319
network

744
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,640
uh where the endomycorrhizae is actually

745
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:59,839
the one that uh is able to do stuff in

746
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,919
there um but those have been buzzwords

747
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:04,639
and don't really do that much in my

748
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,720
opinion bacillus are really the like

749
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,200
main turn on effect for root growth

750
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,120
promotion in the soil um where they're

751
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,360
able to make uh like

752
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:15,839
endogenously inside of themselves iba to

753
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,839
help uh plants root out and get more

754
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,480
root shoots uh and secondary and

755
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,399
tertiary tertiary rooting so it has uh

756
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,400
like exponentially more root tips to be

757
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,240
able to absorb nutrition from

758
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,840
basils are really cool

759
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,120
they're also really easy to start

760
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:30,480
selecting for different environments

761
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,079
that you want them to be able to persist

762
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,278
better in

763
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:35,519
and then

764
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:37,599
my favorite fact about them

765
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,918
it's all called a consortia uh when you

766
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:42,879
have uh like a population of different

767
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:45,520
microorganisms um and when you have the

768
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,679
right proportions of the right ones you

769
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,200
get uh an effect it's like much more

770
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,880
than the sum of their parts where it's

771
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,440
not just like an additive effect where

772
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,559
they're going together it's uh like

773
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,880
uh exponentially making it better um and

774
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:01,918
able to have a more uh turn-on effect

775
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,240
for the plant what about geobacillus so

776
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,120
that's one i'm not super familiar with

777
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,839
uh

778
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,278
i know that uh it was discovered inside

779
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,359
of like geysers

780
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:14,720
um or hot water vents like at the bottom

781
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:16,798
of the seabed uh where these uh bacillus

782
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,079
i don't think they have

783
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:21,918
too much uh use in plants um just where

784
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,759
their like preferred environment is over

785
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,919
like 95 celsius

786
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,960
so like right near the the boiling point

787
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,480
of water um but really cool microbes uh

788
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,200
i know in industry they're going to

789
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,880
start to use those a lot more just be in

790
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,038
the the type of applications that

791
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,840
they're in like higher heat environments

792
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:41,599
and stuff um and i think they also live

793
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:43,519
in like your hot water heater they'll

794
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:45,278
find them in hot water heaters sometimes

795
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,278
just because it's a place where it's

796
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:48,960
like right around 100 degrees celsius

797
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:50,880
all the time and they

798
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,960
are basically the only thing that lives

799
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,600
in that type of environment and can uh

800
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,679
can thrive there what about glomus

801
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:00,480
i see that on a lot of products

802
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,880
glomus uh is mycorrhizae um so there's

803
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,679
an and an ecto form of it ecto is on the

804
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,080
outside of the root uh and grows like

805
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,679
out into the soil and in an effect it

806
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,759
does exponentially increase the surface

807
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,919
area of the soil it helps the plant uh

808
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,278
deal with environmental stresses better

809
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,440
um just

810
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:20,079
endogenously it is able to

811
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,679
uh kind of handle those stresses better

812
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:25,759
uh the the microbes can help elicit a

813
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,080
uh like acquired resistance response

814
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:31,919
from the plant where it knows like hey i

815
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:33,199
need to close up my uh my pores um

816
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,520
because i need to

817
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,558
conserve water in like a time of drought

818
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:40,798
um they're pretty cool again so like

819
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:42,319
cfu's just kind of going back to that

820
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,240
when somebody's

821
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:47,038
you know this right here has you know

822
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,798
6.4 cfus per gram

823
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:50,879
you just just the more the better huh

824
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:53,038
like can you over do

825
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,640
the more the better generally uh no

826
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,798
you're not going to be able to overdo it

827
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,200
uh i mean i guess you could in a like

828
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:00,879
financial sense yeah okay hey where

829
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,080
you're just throwing money away at some

830
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,559
point um i generally don't think of the

831
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,839
mycorrhizae that's in most microbial

832
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,558
products as being something that's

833
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:13,119
really doing all that much just because

834
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,720
you have to get it on super early um in

835
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,959
the the growth of the plant when there's

836
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,679
not that many roots so that it is able

837
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,000
to grow alongside the root as it grows

838
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,880
uh in microbial inoculants in

839
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,640
microbiology and soils the the bacillus

840
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,159
and the different types of trichoderma

841
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,840
fungi that can be in there are going to

842
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,600
be the ones that are doing uh the

843
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:33,759
majority of the work for everything

844
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:36,558
while mycorrhizae gets all the fame now

845
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:39,599
mycorrhizae i heard that it's a lot like

846
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:42,240
significantly less effective

847
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,158
watering in mycorrhizae versus

848
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,880
sprinkling onto the roots

849
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,080
oh

850
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,440
most oh most definitely uh that's one of

851
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:51,678
the things a lot of people don't realize

852
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,759
with it is that for that uh colony

853
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,840
forming unit to be able to actually

854
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:58,640
infect a root a root has to come in

855
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:01,119
direct contact with it uh it can't just

856
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,759
pass by it or anything it has to

857
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:05,839
directly make contact with the root uh

858
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,839
that's why with with recharge water is

859
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,000
always the carrier for it

860
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,439
it gets it evenly and thoroughly through

861
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,480
the soil and if there's a root in there

862
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,159
some mycorrhizae is going to make

863
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,079
contact with it

864
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,440
with just a pure mico product or

865
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,798
something like that

866
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,720
powdering the roots is what you're going

867
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,558
to want to do just because in that case

868
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,240
at least you know you're making contact

869
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:25,839
uh with the roots like we were talking

870
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,558
about pro-mix earlier where they have

871
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:30,158
the pro-mix with mycorrhizae in there uh

872
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,398
there's not that much mycorrhizae in

873
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,559
there to begin with and just the the

874
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:37,038
odds are not stacked in your favor that

875
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:39,038
a root is actually going to make contact

876
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:40,480
with like the one colony forming unit

877
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:43,119
that's around in a pot once you've

878
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,360
planted something in there um so yeah i

879
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:46,959
mean making sure that it gets contact

880
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:48,479
with a root is

881
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,038
definitely going to help it be more

882
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,079
effective um at uh infecting that root

883
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:53,919
and being able to give you those

884
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:57,918
beneficial effects of it now would you

885
00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:01,038
go so far as to say that you shouldn't

886
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,880
water it in uh no i would i wouldn't go

887
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:04,480
that that far um i mean there's

888
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,360
definitely times where like

889
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,798
you're just not gonna be able to uh

890
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:11,759
pull out a plant and powder the roots

891
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:13,679
with it um so yeah i mean if if you have

892
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:14,720
a high enough cfu like what's in

893
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,960
recharge

894
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,240
you definitely can water it in

895
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,319
although we really just have the

896
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,720
mycorrhizae in there to be able to say

897
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:24,639
like yeah it's in there too we have that

898
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,480
but we're really proud of the consortia

899
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,640
of the different bacillus and

900
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,480
trichoderma that are in recharge yeah

901
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,480
i'm really really curious to know like

902
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,319
for example great white is one of those

903
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,399
products that uh is known for

904
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:38,319
mycorrhizae i'm really curious to know

905
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,319
like of that scoop of great white you're

906
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:41,839
mixing in the water and putting in there

907
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:43,119
what percentage

908
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:44,158
is actually going to be hitting the

909
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:46,079
roots you know what i mean i think

910
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,600
that's probably the answer you don't

911
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:49,038
have but yeah

912
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:50,879
not one i have off the top of my head

913
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,519
and just want to admit like i

914
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,440
uh greatly respect great white and what

915
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,679
they did uh started to bring like a

916
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,759
premium microbe uh

917
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,200
consortia out to the public and getting

918
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,519
it out there

919
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,600
but a lot of innovation has gone on uh

920
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,159
recently in microbiology it's the

921
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:10,798
biggest expanding field in uh

922
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,559
agriculture and horticulture um it's

923
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:13,918
it's just gonna it's like the big next

924
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:16,000
thing in agriculture where people are

925
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,880
starting to realize that like

926
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,640
just dumping fertilizer especially in uh

927
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,640
commercial agriculture out in fields and

928
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,399
everything that just dumping fertilizer

929
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,480
on your land was killing off all the

930
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,319
endogenous microorganisms that you had

931
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,960
and making it really really hard to

932
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:33,439
garden there uh where you it it's more

933
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,038
treating it like uh hydroponics at that

934
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,840
point the soil is just your media it's

935
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:39,759
completely dead and inert um but yeah

936
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,558
getting back to bringing the life into

937
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:45,599
your soil um is

938
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:47,038
good i mean it it helps everybody uh

939
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,199
and just getting

940
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:52,640
being more efficient at the fertilizer

941
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:56,000
that you do use um it's it's pretty cool

942
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,759
i'm i'm excited to be in this field kind

943
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,640
of piggybacking off of what you just

944
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:02,879
said synthetic fertilizers do they

945
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,200
really kill off microbes or do the

946
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,880
microbes feed off of some of them or

947
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,480
what's your take on that

948
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,399
it uh like we were talking about earlier

949
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,120
depends on what microbes you're using if

950
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:15,199
you're uh brewing up a compost tea with

951
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:17,278
some like soil from the forest that

952
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,480
you've gone and collected

953
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:20,000
yeah the

954
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,240
the different chemical fertilizers and

955
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,919
synthetic fertilizers are gonna kill

956
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,399
some of your microbes but if you're

957
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,720
using uh ones that have been selected

958
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:30,639
and bred uh for their virulency and

959
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,079
they're able their ability to persist in

960
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,240
those horticulture and agricultural

961
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:37,119
systems like we as uh medicinal

962
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,839
gardeners use um they are

963
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:41,918
they thrive in that situation um where

964
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:44,319
they are able to absorb and hold on to

965
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,000
nutrition act as a bioprotectant they

966
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:48,158
don't really care that the salts are

967
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,960
around them uh they've been selected to

968
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:54,240
live in that environment and be able to

969
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,399
thrive there so no um if you're using

970
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,480
the right microbes then no there's no

971
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:00,000
issue with using uh being in like a

972
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,919
higher salinity environment using

973
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,640
synthetics or anything like that now how

974
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,038
about ph up and ph down i know there's a

975
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,720
lot of people they'll get their water

976
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:10,878
they'll need to ph adjust their water

977
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,878
maybe the original water that they have

978
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:15,440
is coming in too high for example as

979
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:17,918
sodium bicarbonates at high ph so i

980
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,240
needed to add in a couple drops of ph

981
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,559
down which normal ph down i believe most

982
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,158
of them are phosphoric acid right and so

983
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:25,679
they think that those couple drops all

984
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,240
it really takes is a couple drops two

985
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,559
three drops maybe a milliliter to bring

986
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,239
that down to the acceptable range now

987
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,078
there are people out there that

988
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,078
use that phosphoric acid mix in get

989
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,359
their water adjusted

990
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,760
but then when they water their plants

991
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:42,719
like you're killing off microbes

992
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,599
what's your take on uh so once you

993
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,439
actually dilute the ph up and ph down

994
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,879
it's not going to have any effect on the

995
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,878
microbes like i was saying earlier

996
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:53,118
they're able to operate at a real wide

997
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:55,199
range of phs

998
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,960
and just a a

999
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,960
pretty good point to make the water when

1000
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,720
you're doing that is not their native

1001
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,400
environment we want to get them out of

1002
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:04,959
the water and into the soil

1003
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,960
as soon as we possibly can to prevent

1004
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,119
selecting for a waterborne environment

1005
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,559
these are root growth or root borne

1006
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,720
microorganisms

1007
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,159
they're meant to be in the root zone we

1008
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:15,679
don't want to keep them in the water too

1009
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:17,358
long it's just meant to be a really good

1010
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:19,199
even thorough carrier to get them all

1011
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:21,598
the way through the soil instead of just

1012
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:24,000
having like pockets of it here and there

1013
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,039
now what about adding ph up a ph sound

1014
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,079
directly i know we're kind of getting

1015
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,920
off topic here we're talking about

1016
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,480
microbes but this kind of follows up

1017
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,358
here so when you're adding ph up and ph

1018
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,039
down directly to a nutrient mix i've

1019
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:37,440
heard that

1020
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:39,519
that's going to bind with some of those

1021
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,800
nutrients and potentially make them an

1022
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:45,199
unusable form so it was recommended that

1023
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,079
you should be diluting down right mixing

1024
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:50,319
your ph up and down in water first so it

1025
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,079
bonds to that and then putting it into

1026
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,480
your nutrient solution is that

1027
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,119
a true story or is that a true true

1028
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,480
story in general chemistry um that's

1029
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,838
going to be the way that you would want

1030
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,320
to do that just to where you're not

1031
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:04,960
adding concentrated acid or concentrated

1032
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,960
base uh to your solution that already

1033
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,800
has nutrients in it just because it is

1034
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,720
fairly easy for

1035
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,280
some chemical reactions to happen there

1036
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:14,719
and you have some like fallout or

1037
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,640
precipitate is what it's called in

1038
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:18,799
chemistry where i don't know if you've

1039
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,480
ever mixed up the main one people see is

1040
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,280
silica where they'll mix up their

1041
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,039
nutrients first and then put silica in

1042
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,800
and you just see it get all cloudy and

1043
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:29,039
then there's like

1044
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,640
silicate at the bottom of your uh your

1045
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:31,759
reservoir and that's just where that

1046
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,000
silica

1047
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,680
can't go in a concentrated form can't go

1048
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
in with anything else it needs to get

1049
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:40,000
diluted first so that when you mix the

1050
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,440
other stuff in it's not in that high

1051
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,239
concentration that's going to cause a

1052
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,159
precipitate or anything like that

1053
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,319
most of the time with microbes when

1054
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,159
you're watering them in

1055
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,760
you want to mix your nutrients how you

1056
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:53,440
normally do so if you're mixing silica

1057
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,800
mix that first go ahead and mix up your

1058
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,760
a or your b

1059
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,440
um ph how you normally do and then go

1060
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,599
ahead and add the microbes in as like

1061
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,280
the last thing so that they're not

1062
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,079
experiencing a huge ph change or

1063
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,400
anything when they get into the water um

1064
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,079
they do raise the ph uh just as a

1065
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,440
function of their biology water is not

1066
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,640
their native environment like we were

1067
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,720
talking about we want to get them in the

1068
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:16,078
soil as soon as they get in the soil

1069
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:17,279
which is their native environment they

1070
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,680
start to

1071
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,359
make carbonic acid and carboxylic

1072
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,960
carboxylic

1073
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:24,480
uh like there's a whole group of acids

1074
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,720
that they're able to make and that's how

1075
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,440
they buffer and regulate the ph around

1076
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:29,519
uh

1077
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,440
themselves and where they inhabit the

1078
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:33,920
root zone so it kind of makes it to

1079
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,480
where ph doesn't matter as much anymore

1080
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,119
because a much more natural system

1081
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,119
is taking care of that for you gotcha

1082
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,800
i'm glad you confirmed that dilute the

1083
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,960
ph up in ph down because i actually made

1084
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,920
a video on that it has over 100 000

1085
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,720
views

1086
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,000
and

1087
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,879
you know that's what i learned and i

1088
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,719
wanted to confirm it with people and you

1089
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,240
kind of confirmed that one so there was

1090
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:55,838
people in the comments section like no

1091
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,598
way this is useless blah blah

1092
00:37:55,838 --> 00:38:00,559
blah blah so

1093
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,519
um and just want to clarify too that uh

1094
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:05,358
you can still put ph up or ph down

1095
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:07,039
directly into your nutrient solution

1096
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:08,799
especially if it's being stirred the

1097
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:11,119
whole time because it's only going to be

1098
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,119
super concentrated as like the couple of

1099
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,280
seconds of that drop hits the water and

1100
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,280
then it gets diluted right away and

1101
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,519
there's not really that much opportunity

1102
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,280
for like a precipitate to form um or you

1103
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:22,880
start to change what's going on in that

1104
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,079
nutrient solution so it's not

1105
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,160
detrimental

1106
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,000
no not not super detrimental the main

1107
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:30,799
one is silica mix your silica up with

1108
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,559
plain water first uh and then start

1109
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,560
mixing in your nutrients and everything

1110
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:36,480
gotcha okay let me get let's get back on

1111
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,000
the individual microbes kind of of

1112
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,199
course a little bit but i think it's it

1113
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,559
all relates and it's really good

1114
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:41,519
information so

1115
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:42,960
yeah

1116
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:46,800
this next one i'm gonna have trouble

1117
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,800
pronouncing pan bacillus

1118
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,760
pan bacillus is just another one of uh

1119
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,159
like classification of different

1120
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,520
bacillus that are out there um and it

1121
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:57,920
acts like a root growth promoting

1122
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:59,440
rhizobacteria um they're in there they

1123
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,480
make iaa

1124
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,838
into acetic acid um some other root

1125
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,838
growth promotion

1126
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:06,719
enzymes and stuff

1127
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:08,559
and

1128
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,399
i think that they're able to elicit

1129
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:11,599
somewhat of a sars response from the

1130
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,920
plant too

1131
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,599
where it kind of just gets it ready for

1132
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,519
if there was going to be some type of

1133
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,880
pathogen or bug coming around it's just

1134
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:21,759
going to be better able to deal with

1135
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,838
those stresses and better able to uh

1136
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,680
trigger its immune response coming from

1137
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:27,920
them okay

1138
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:28,879
how about pseudonomus i pronounce that

1139
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,559
one right

1140
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,559
pseudomonas pseudomonas

1141
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,959
that's going to be one that lives much

1142
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,200
more like on plant surfaces i'm pretty

1143
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,000
sure um so that'll be the one you'll see

1144
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,519
in like foliar microbial products a lot

1145
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,920
um

1146
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,280
not one that i'm super familiar with

1147
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,838
that's something i need to do a little

1148
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,920
bit more research on myself okay the

1149
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:53,519
last one i have on the list here is

1150
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,240
streptomyces

1151
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:56,239
i get that one right

1152
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,838
i told you i was gonna be butchering

1153
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,480
names

1154
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:06,239
the pseudomonas streptomyces like all

1155
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,280
are pretty much just like plant growth

1156
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:11,759
promoters uh make some substances that

1157
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,839
kind of uh out compete uh

1158
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,000
pathogens that could be coming around

1159
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:17,838
and then can kind of help make the

1160
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,800
trigger the plant to start making its

1161
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:19,838
own

1162
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,480
uh

1163
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:24,639
like root growth promotion um substances

1164
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,800
that it makes in their ia iba

1165
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:29,598
other stuff like that okay is there any

1166
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,359
other microbes you that i didn't list

1167
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,720
off that you think we should cover or is

1168
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:33,838
that pretty much the

1169
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:34,639
most of it

1170
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:37,039
uh

1171
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:38,400
i think we pretty much got most of it

1172
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,318
okay cool

1173
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,880
now how about i got a couple other

1174
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:44,159
things for you amino acids you touched

1175
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,599
on them a little bit earlier you

1176
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,519
mentioned that they have to be in the l

1177
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,440
form so anything else you talk to us

1178
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:52,639
about amino acids

1179
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,720
oh definitely so l amino acids um are

1180
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:56,879
necessary for all life not just plants

1181
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,439
like we need amino acids our body makes

1182
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,838
amino acids um they're like the building

1183
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:06,240
blocks for enzymes um enzymes uh act as

1184
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:08,000
catalysts for chemical reactions where

1185
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:08,719
they make them

1186
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,519
like

1187
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:13,519
the soil has to exert less energy to get

1188
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,920
a chemical reaction to happen so it's

1189
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,519
just kind of overall optimizing the

1190
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,519
entire system

1191
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:21,199
it helps plants translocate nutrients

1192
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,599
better um

1193
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:24,719
they're i mean they're huge especially

1194
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,800
in uh

1195
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:30,239
when people in synthetics

1196
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,839
are trying to grow high brix plants um

1197
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:33,358
one of their like limiting factors in

1198
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:35,519
being able to get to like a higher brix

1199
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:37,759
level which corresponds with a higher

1200
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:40,480
plant health and resistant to pathogens

1201
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,920
and bugs and everything um

1202
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,199
like the the main thing that they're

1203
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,400
missing when they're trying to do that

1204
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:49,439
is having those amino acids um

1205
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,200
and amino acids aren't just

1206
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,679
like just singular things too they can

1207
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:54,719
be complexed with other things uh where

1208
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:56,559
it can help

1209
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,318
nitrogen get into the plant better it

1210
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:00,078
can help uh

1211
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:02,719
just about anything get into the plant

1212
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,480
better um it's it's just one of the big

1213
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:06,639
things in like the

1214
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,960
newer uh

1215
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:12,239
trying to think bio fertilizers that are

1216
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,559
coming out um the the use of those amino

1217
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,318
acids and using them for their intended

1218
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:18,000
purpose to help nutrients get into the

1219
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:20,559
plant and help the plant just overall

1220
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
optimize its metabolism better uh has

1221
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:24,159
helped a lot of people get to like

1222
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
another yield threshold in their garden

1223
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:28,159
um or get over a certain yield limiting

1224
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,280
factor sometimes those el amino acids

1225
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:31,118
are going to be the limiting factor

1226
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,440
there so like you mentioned amino acids

1227
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,960
has multiple uses one thing i learned

1228
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,960
actually from harley smith shout out to

1229
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,199
him i took his master growers course

1230
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,079
last year

1231
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:43,759
specifically for hydroponic growers now

1232
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,359
correct me if i'm wrong here right so

1233
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,200
hydroponic growers

1234
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:48,480
some of the calcium

1235
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:49,919
you'll get like

1236
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,039
like the ring around the calcium

1237
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,440
deposits basically it it's basically

1238
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:58,719
calcium carbonate is what it turns into

1239
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,119
if using hard water for example right

1240
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:03,118
yeah that that calcium is bonding to

1241
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,119
like dissolve carbon dioxide in the

1242
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,039
water um and making that calcium

1243
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,480
carbonate and a little trick to avoid

1244
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:10,400
that is what he had mentioned is

1245
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,159
sprinkle a little bit of amino acids in

1246
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,160
that water and it'll actually bind to

1247
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:16,159
the amino acid it'll prevent that

1248
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:17,838
ring those rings from occurring which i

1249
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:19,598
thought was super interesting that's

1250
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:23,440
what i was talking about with like amino

1251
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:26,240
complex nutrients uh where yeah it

1252
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,920
makes it 100 just more bioavailable to

1253
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,239
the plant and prevents any type of

1254
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,400
lockout going on there just because it

1255
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:34,479
uh will have a much higher affinity to

1256
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,119
that calcium than the carbonate that's

1257
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,519
uh in its dissolve or the the co2 that's

1258
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,318
dissolved into the water okay gotcha

1259
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:44,559
another thing that i want to bring up is

1260
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:46,480
dextrose so we kind of briefly talked

1261
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:48,239
about this before we started recording

1262
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,039
um dextrose it's something that i mean i

1263
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:53,199
got another micro product here is blue

1264
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:56,480
planet nutrients root magic rhizomix and

1265
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:58,078
it says 20 dextrose can you explain to

1266
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,440
us what it is

1267
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,920
so dextrose is just a a type of uh sugar

1268
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,440
that's made by plants um i mean that's

1269
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,000
what plants do

1270
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,400
they photosynthesize sunlight co2 and

1271
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,480
water and turn that into carbohydrates

1272
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,880
and sugars for themselves um to be able

1273
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,039
to use for energy to uh make the

1274
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,119
medicinal flowers that we like debt so

1275
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:22,559
dextrose is one of those like sucrose

1276
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,318
fructo fructose glucose um i mean

1277
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:25,519
there's a whole range of sugars i'm

1278
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:27,759
never going to be one to say more

1279
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:29,119
diversity in something is a bad thing so

1280
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,040
like if you're trying to do the best you

1281
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,000
possibly can using a variety of sugar

1282
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:37,279
sources um is not the worst idea in the

1283
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,559
world but molasses um it generally acts

1284
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,280
as like the one of the better um food

1285
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:45,358
sources for microorganisms um just where

1286
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,079
it is it's a complete sugar

1287
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:49,279
it has everything they need and yeah i

1288
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,599
mean

1289
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,800
you can use like some people use honey

1290
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:57,519
some people use uh like high fructose

1291
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,960
corn syrup if they're crazy um like

1292
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,199
there's lots of different options brown

1293
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,280
sugar brown sugar out there and the

1294
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,919
different types of sugars uh can

1295
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,240
actually bloom out uh different types of

1296
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,240
microbes will prefer different types of

1297
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:12,559
sugar sources

1298
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:14,078
so yeah using a wide variety of if

1299
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:15,599
you're trying to have the most diversity

1300
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:17,200
you possibly can

1301
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,680
or with something like recharge using

1302
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:20,719
the molasses that's in there is meant uh

1303
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:22,239
for the

1304
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:24,559
the microbes that are in there as their

1305
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:26,159
food source molasses

1306
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,719
a little want to get a little bit deeper

1307
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:30,480
into that i've been told that

1308
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:31,519
it shouldn't be used as this old drench

1309
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,760
at least there's some people out there

1310
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,960
that say there's research that backs

1311
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,560
that it shouldn't be used as a little

1312
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,920
drench because it

1313
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:39,279
uh and i'm speaking about my head a

1314
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,200
little bit here it

1315
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,960
binds with something it clogs up the

1316
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:44,879
roots prevents nutrient uptake something

1317
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,519
along those lines are you familiar with

1318
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:50,480
that at all or it can if you use it in

1319
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:53,440
really really high concentrations um it

1320
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,280
can start to claw group force um

1321
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,440
and and clog up brew tips so that it's

1322
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,200
not able to absorb as much nutrition you

1323
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,159
kind of run into the same thing with uh

1324
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:05,199
humic acids too you have to use a ton of

1325
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:07,279
them uh like a ton a ton of them but it

1326
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,358
can start to uh clog root pores and

1327
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,800
stuff like that generally not a problem

1328
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:12,960
with people's gardens at all unless

1329
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,119
they're like i dump the whole bottle of

1330
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,039
molasses into my watering can and like

1331
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,720
try and go water that in like then you

1332
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:20,800
might have an issue if you're using it

1333
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:22,159
like a teaspoon per gallon or something

1334
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,079
like that there shouldn't be an issue at

1335
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:26,159
all i usually use a tablespoon per

1336
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,400
gallon tablespoon per gallon shouldn't

1337
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:30,879
be an issue at all either all right guru
