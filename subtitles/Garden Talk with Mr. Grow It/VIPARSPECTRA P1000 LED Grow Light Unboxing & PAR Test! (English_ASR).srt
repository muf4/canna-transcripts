00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,779
what's up everybody feed I don't know me

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:05,669
my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:07,318
you're watching my extra channel VIPRE

4
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:10,199
specter sent me over their brand new

5
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:12,000
grow light the p1000 LED grow light and

6
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:13,979
in this video I'm gonna unbox the unit

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,769
and I'm also going to do a part test on

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,899
it this is one of five LED grow lights

9
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:21,750
that Viper Specter is releasing in 2020

10
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:26,278
they also have the P 1500 LED grow light

11
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:29,730
the P 2500 LED grow light the VP 1000

12
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:31,349
LED grow light and the VP 2000 LED grow

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,058
light I'm not going to go over all of

14
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,280
the grow lights features in this video

15
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:36,689
but I will link all of the grow lights I

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,030
just mentioned in the description

17
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:41,280
section below okay opening up the box

18
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,329
and it looks like I opened up the box

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,308
upside down oops

20
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,100
first thing I'm pulling out the box here

21
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:49,769
is rope ratchet hangers here is their

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,189
user manual it includes safety

23
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:58,050
information specifications about the

24
00:00:52,189 --> 00:01:01,078
p1000 P 1500 P 2500 and some suggestions

25
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:03,328
on how to use the light there's a small

26
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,420
card here which says what to do if

27
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:10,290
you're happy or if you're unhappy a 6

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,469
foot power cord a wire hanging kit and

29
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,960
of course the fixture for the part test

30
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:18,509
I'm going to use the apogee MQ 500 power

31
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,109
meter this meter measures from 389

32
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,989
nanometers

33
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:23,670
- 692 nanometers plus or minus 5

34
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:26,819
nanometers and the measurements are in

35
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,560
ppfd this test is done just to give you

36
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:29,699
a general idea of what the power output

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,600
is for this light

38
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,490
it's not gonna be hundred percent

39
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,809
accurate I'm taking measurements in a

40
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:35,879
Grove tent and the reflective walls

41
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,769
could increase the power numbers so just

42
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:39,688
keep that in mind this core light has a

43
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:41,578
flowering coverage area of a two foot by

44
00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:43,500
two foot and I'm taking measurements in

45
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:45,449
a two foot by four foot grow tent

46
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,978
I'll do my best to keep my par meter on

47
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,820
one side of the tent I'll take

48
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:50,310
measurements at three different

49
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:53,188
distances twelve inches away eighteen

50
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,140
inches away and 24 inches away all three

51
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:57,209
of those distances are recommended in

52
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,280
their user manual this girl leg does

53
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:02,669
have a dimmer on it for this part test

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,090
I'll keep the dimmer at 100% at 100%

55
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:09,810
this unit pulls 101 watts from the wall

56
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,450
at point 8 3 amps alright let's get into

57
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:51,299
the measurements

58
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:51,298
