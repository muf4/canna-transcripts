5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,620
3000 LED grow light in this video I'm

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,570
going to unboxing it I am going to test

7
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:17,070
the power output and I'll do a heat test

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,050
on it I'm not gonna go over all of the

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,339
girl lights features in this video but I

10
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,140
will leave a link down in the

11
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:24,118
description section below if you want to

12
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,880
learn more about it such as what diodes

13
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:29,009
are used to drive our spectrum so on and

14
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,108
so forth alright first thing out the box

15
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,550
is a user manual this includes

16
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,730
information such as assembly

17
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,828
instructions dimming operation some grow

18
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:41,279
tips some safety information and

19
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,530
information on their warranty next out

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,359
the box is to rope ratchet hangers and

21
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,609
in this bag there's also two metal

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,909
brackets for hanging they've included a

23
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:54,149
sheet of stickers and here's the fixture

24
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:56,549
oh and they've also included an Ethernet

25
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,698
cable for the part test I'm gonna use

26
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:01,948
the apogee mq6 20 extended part meter

27
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,618
this meter measures from 340 nanometers

28
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:06,810
to 1040 nanometers and the measurements

29
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,340
are in ppfd I do these videos just to

30
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,170
give you a general idea of what the part

31
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,180
output is it's not gonna be hundred

32
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,100
percent accurate I take measurements in

33
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,439
grow tents which have reflective walls

34
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:17,879
that could increase the numbers so just

35
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:19,618
keep that in mind the flower and

36
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:22,079
coverage area for this girl light is 2

37
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:23,790
feet by 5 feet but Mars hydro mentioned

38
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,618
that this would do great and they 2 foot

39
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,180
by 4 foot grow 10 they actually sent me

40
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,379
over two of these grill lights and

41
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,630
they've requested that I take

42
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,978
measurements in a 4 foot by 4 foot grow

43
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:34,560
10 so you can see what the power

44
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:36,090
measurements are in that size grow 10 if

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,859
you want me to do another video where I

46
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,810
take measurements in a 2 foot by 4 foot

47
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:42,118
grow 10 let me know down in the comment

48
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,950
section below this LED grow light does

49
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,950
have a dimmer on it for the measurements

50
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,450
i'll set the different to 100% i've

51
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,850
plugged the LED grow light into my

52
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,850
kilowatt meter and it shows two point

53
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:56,158
four five amps pulling 290 watts from

54
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:57,819
the wall alright let's get into the

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:04:33,879
measurements

56
00:01:57,819 --> 00:04:33,879
