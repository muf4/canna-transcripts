1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,639
coming up on garden talk you put so many

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,160
materials so many ions in the root zone

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:09,039
that it creates a high pressure gradient

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,160
outside the roots which forces it into

5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,879
the plant

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,960
anything that you're adding microbially

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,960
is going to create in its own

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,800
environment and it's going to create

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,800
some slimes and films and you're not

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,560
going to know what's going on so it's

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,080
kind of gross science just to be like oh

12
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,919
all microbes die whenever you put

13
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,000
synthetic fertilizers on there that's

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,599
not true it's very much of a gray area

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,439
yes some are super sensitive but some

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,558
are actually really resistant to these

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,719
chemicals they're putting down and

18
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,479
actually can help synthetic systems if

19
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,480
you brew compost tea do not adjust the

20
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,799
ph whatever it is put it inside your

21
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,519
medium and the buffering index inside

22
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,439
your soil will figure out where it wants

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,039
the proper ph to be

24
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,799
grow more plant matter carbon-based

25
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,879
systems are going to grow more

26
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,198
cannabinoids more alkaloids within the

27
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:53,198
plant

28
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,759

pathology in this episode he breaks down

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,359
bro science versus grow science we go

42
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,920
over a ton of different gardening

43
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,680
processes that many deem as bro science

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,159
tim reveals the actual science that

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,479

talk podcast today i am joined with tim

102
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,519
mccormick from cultured biologics how

103
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,518
you doing today good how you doing chris

104
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,959
i'm doing great excited for this episode

105
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,158
today we're going to be talking about

106
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,840
bro science versus grow science so

107
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,399
basically i have a whole bunch of highly

108
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,200
debated topics that many people swear

109
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,799
work

110
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,438
while others claim that it's just bro

111
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,959
science man so tim and i met at mjbizcon

112
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,840
and i thought tim would be the perfect

113
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,519
person to have on this since he has such

114
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,519
deep knowledge in several different

115
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,680
areas of horticulture you've actually

116
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,000
developed your own organic fertilizer as

117
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,480
well it's 100 water soluble we'll get

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,959
into that in more detail later on but

119
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,560
yeah this is going to be a great episode

120
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,918
first can you give the listeners an

121
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,199
introduction maybe tell us a little bit

122
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,560
about yourself and kind of how you got

123
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,319
into gardening yeah absolutely um so

124
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,280
my experience of gardening goes back to

125
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,040
my childhood pretty much my mother is a

126
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,439
has been a horticulturalist for like 35

127
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,879
years so take your kid to work today was

128
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,478
take tim to the greenhouse make them

129
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,040
water make them pick off leaves make

130
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,360
them go move pout and the boxes of

131
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,639
plants and stuff like that so i've been

132
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,400
i've been gardening since i was a little

133
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,879
kid but

134
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,519
my real career experience got started

135
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,199
when i got out of college um

136
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,879
you know didn't really know what i

137
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,720
wanted to do

138
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,959
got a degree in chemistry emphasis on

139
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,479
like compound pharmacy so it was you

140
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,439
know how to make medicine for people and

141
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:59,680
i didn't really like how the

142
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,120
pharmaceutical industry was kind of

143
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,600
how it's kind of geared

144
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,199
um to making pills for pills for pills

145
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,960
and it's not really where i wanted to

146
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,000
come from i really wanted to make

147
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,478
natural

148
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,839
natural medicine for people so i kind of

149
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:15,680
got out didn't really know what i want

150
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,959
and then by happenstance got to me a a

151
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,199
business owner trying to start up a

152
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:22,239
fertilizer company out of fort collins

153
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,000
um asked me and my best friend greg if

154
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,360
we wanted to move he's a marketer i

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,600
wanted to move to

156
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,240
colorado to start her career

157
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,919
and the fertilizer industry and being a

158
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,918
compound chemist i was like absolutely

159
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,000
like let's let's do it i can i have

160
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,120
experience of growing

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,038
[Music]

162
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,918
so at the time i was i was growing my

163
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,918
own uh medicinal plants inside my my

164
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,599
closet you know just trying to going to

165
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,839
school for chemistry kind of growing

166
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,800
plants hydroponically at the same time

167
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,119
um

168
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,120
then kind of got

169
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,959
thrown into this mix of of the

170
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,840
fertilizer company and from there i got

171
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:00,000
to travel the world um working with

172
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,439
acrochemicals and

173
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,199
latin america

174
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,240
domestic agriculture

175
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,120
so

176
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,160
my career background is in uh commercial

177
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,319
agriculture so i come from instead of

178
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,680
you know the the hydroponic entry being

179
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,199
where i started i started commercial

180
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,759
agriculture and uh you know got to do

181
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,680
some really cool stuff with uh the catie

182
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,479
it's a latin america university that

183
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,759
does

184
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,240
cacao

185
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,160
genetics to do bananas pineapples so a

186
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,840
lot of tropical fruits

187
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,120
then i came over to

188
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:32,839
working with the university of florida

189
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,840
extension program

190
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:38,719
um really got into

191
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:41,439
how to use these you know organic

192
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,160
chemicals on on our fertigation systems

193
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,879
our irrigation technologies so really my

194
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,960
background really stems from me

195
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,399
trying to take these or the organic

196
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,879
materials that we're making with our

197
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,560
fertilizer company and applying them to

198
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,918
our industrialized technology and trying

199
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,839
to find a hybrid

200
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,839
about four years ago my best friends and

201
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,279
i decided to break off and start culture

202
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,758
biologics

203
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,918
formulating our own

204
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,560
our own you know organic fertilizers

205
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:09,758
microbial inoculants bio pesticides and

206
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,839
so we've been doing this for about four

207
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,240
years now

208
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,439
pretty pretty steadily some

209
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,120
just

210
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,439
in the process of now releasing all of

211
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,439
my all my formulations that's awesome

212
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,079
yeah i mean you mentioned through dms

213
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:26,478
chemistry microbiology plant physiology

214
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,399
soil sciences plant pathologies a whole

215
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,159
bunch of different areas where you have

216
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,000
knowledge in which is which is awesome

217
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,280
that's really cool yeah it was actually

218
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,439
really cool i didn't you know a lot of

219
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,839
people go get the bachelors and masters

220
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,918
and phds and postdoc and whatnot um i

221
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,119
kind of got you know my

222
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,198
quote

223
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,038
pseudo masters working with the

224
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,478
university of florida extension program

225
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,478
because i got to work with

226
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,719
plant pathology professors entomology

227
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,000
professors soil scientists

228
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,680
at some point when i was working down in

229
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,959
latin america worked with the united

230
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,400
nations food and agriculture

231
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:57,598
organization

232
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,359
and they kind of taught me a

233
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:00,800
regenerative agriculture and what it

234
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,360
needs to what we need to do to kind of

235
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,240
repair uh the land throughout the world

236
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,400
um so and even it kind of merged into my

237
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,840
my own degree with pharmaceuticals where

238
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,959
you know the european commission we're

239
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,959
working with we're working with the

240
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,439
european commission on trying to figure

241
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,519
out how to reduce healthcare costs and

242
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,959
after all the the the

243
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,598
scientists and

244
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,878
hundreds of people at symposiums trying

245
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:24,478
to figure out how do we reduce

246
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,720
healthcare the number one thing it came

247
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,318
back to is growing nutritious food

248
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,280
so it's really cool like it was a real

249
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,759
full circle experience for me um

250
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,038
you know trying to trying to to figure

251
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,879
out how to grow food better and how to

252
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,319
make people healthier that's awesome

253
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,799
that's really cool all right first thing

254
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,519
let's dive into powdered nutrients

255
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,519
versus liquid fertilizer right so many

256
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,440
people claim that 99

257
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,440
of the liquid

258
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,440
in liquid fertilizer is water so you're

259
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,880
mostly paying for water

260
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,360
my question is how much liquid

261
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,679
fertilizer bottle is water and is all

262
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,839
that actually required right like i know

263
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:02,079
water needs to be in there so you know

264
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,320
chemicals don't bind together

265
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,879
you know unexpectedly and so forth but

266
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,120
is it true that 99 is water are

267
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,679
companies ripping off consumers by

268
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,120
giving excess water in their fertilizer

269
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,479
ah

270
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,679
you know that's

271
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,159
a hard that's not there's not exactly a

272
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,399
clear cut answer to that

273
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,799
so water suspends right water's a

274
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,958
solvent um you know there's only a

275
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,399
certain amount of salt you can put into

276
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,159
water until it starts falling out i mean

277
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,519
imagine you putting in sugar into a

278
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:32,480
glass of water it's going to dissolve

279
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,000
it's going to dissolve it's going to

280
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,120
dissolve till you put too much in there

281
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,799
and then it's going to start falling out

282
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,679
and it won't go into it

283
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,399
so

284
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:42,639
from a chemical point of view

285
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,440
you do you do need water you do need

286
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,759
other dissolution agents like weak acids

287
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,440
and things like that to kind of keep all

288
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,838
the salts broken down to keep everything

289
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,760
from binding together like you said

290
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,920
but commonly it's like

291
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:59,838
50 to 80 percent water usually

292
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,599
i try to keep down the low end for when

293
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,600
i make my liquid formulations but

294
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,639
there's a lot of i mean the hydroponic

295
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,240
industry is taking all these

296
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,078
concentrated salts and putting them in

297
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,440
the liquid form and diluting them

298
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,278
essentially

299
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,399
powdered salts being as the most

300
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,720
concentrated you know we do have

301
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:18,559
a smaller amount of salts going into the

302
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,079
hydroponics so most of the time it is

303
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,559
watered down salts

304
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,639
um and everybody sells the same

305
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,799
general formulations with the same

306
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,159
amount of water and it's it's it's

307
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,319
pretty wasteful especially when you get

308
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:33,360
to like the shipping end of things

309
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,519
um so quick answer 50 80

310
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,120
long answer doesn't always apply to that

311
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,639
gotcha okay

312
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,120
now let's talk about organic versus

313
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,720
synthetic so um you know when talking

314
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,879
about synthetic nutrients they're

315
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,160
already in a form that is available for

316
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,278
the plant to uptake they're in an

317
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:51,360
ionized form right right with

318
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:54,639
organic a lot of these amendments they

319
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,959
need to be broken down by microbes first

320
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,278
and then put into a form that the plant

321
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,799
can uptake you can easily over feed

322
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:01,838
using synthetic nutrients because the

323
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,439
plant is just going to continue to

324
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,279
uptake uptake uptake a lot of people

325
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,800
call this force feeding that's what they

326
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,639
refer to it as

327
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,039
when it comes to organic many people say

328
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,559
you you can't over fertilize when

329
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,120
growing organic because the plant is

330
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:18,639
only going to uptake what it needs when

331
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,039
it needs it via the exudates it releases

332
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,879
for the beneficial bacteria that's in

333
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,879
the rhizosphere and that exchange is

334
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:27,200
happening between the exudates being

335
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,120
released in exchange for the potential

336
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,200
nutrients so my question is can you over

337
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,600
fertilize when growing organic

338
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,000
um yes yes you can

339
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,399
um you can overdo the kelps you can

340
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,240
overdo the alfalfas you can definitely

341
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,559
overdo the guanos

342
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,480
just understand these these

343
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,919
materials still have nitrates and

344
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,480
phosphates in them

345
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:50,078
um blood muon has lots of nitrates guano

346
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,159
has lots of phosphates and nitrates

347
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:53,679
usually um so if you put too much down

348
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,600
and i've done this before on my outdoor

349
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,399
properties um

350
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,200
you know

351
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,799
you can

352
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,399
nuke a crop real easy um so some of it's

353
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,719
some of it takes time to break down some

354
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,399
is pretty available immediately um the

355
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,000
biggest difference between the synthetic

356
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,440
is is it you create osmotic pressure at

357
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,600
the root zone so you put so many

358
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,120
materials so many ions in the root zone

359
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,920
that it creates a high pressure gradient

360
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,078
outside the roots which forces it into

361
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,278
the plant and you can kind of train a

362
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,439
plant that's why you see people like

363
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:25,360
with athena and front row and they can

364
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,279
get up to like 5ec

365
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,959
and peak flower because they've been

366
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,958
training their plant to take that that

367
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,559
osmotic pressure and they work through

368
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,319
the plant up to it

369
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:37,119
whereas like the organic exactly

370
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,160
like we just said the exudates the

371
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,759
the mycorrhizae the beneficial bacteria

372
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,600
the network will slowly break down and

373
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,600
make compounds in a form that the plant

374
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,920
can just take up passively so it's

375
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,040
really hard to overdo or overfeeding

376
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:52,719
organics but you can't do it

377
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,039
so it's just it's like i said it's about

378
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,440
but it's in organics about finding an

379
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,679
equalization and harmonization between

380
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,000
um the life in the soil and the the

381
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,000
materials that are required to be broken

382
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,480
down for plant nutrition okay and then

383
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,639
diving deep into the micro microbes side

384
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,159
of things when using synthetic nutrients

385
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,799
like like mentioned before they're an

386
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:15,278
ionized form already available for plant

387
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,639
uptake are microbes useful when using

388
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:17,838
synthetic nutrients some people say it

389
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,959
is some people say that microbes are

390
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,639
going to be able to survive in a high

391
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,759
selenium environment and it's going to

392
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,680
be useful

393
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,278
when using synthetic nutrients other

394
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,120
people say that microbes are completely

395
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,200
pointless you should not be inoculating

396
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,200
your medium when using synthetic

397
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,320
nutrients what's the real deal with that

398
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,519
so

399
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,839
funny aspects i just had this

400
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,200
conversation with colin from crop king

401
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,079
um the other day

402
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,160
um

403
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,479
awesome consultant awesome awesome dude

404
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,480
for for you know all things plant

405
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,519
related but he had the conversation of

406
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,399
you know he doesn't believe microbes are

407
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,480
are needed in a hydroponic medium and so

408
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,278
my my answer is kind of

409
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,720
twofold um first you have to break down

410
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,399
hydroponics and like synthetic

411
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,879
fertilizers like are using just water

412
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,958
culture are using any substrates because

413
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:03,679
cocoa and p are still inert rockwool's

414
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,078
still inert and they're still

415
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,000
hydroponics right so when i go to water

416
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:11,278
culture i like to keep everything as

417
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,839
sterile as possible anything that you're

418
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,078
adding microbially is going to create in

419
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,320
its own environment and it's going to

420
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:20,239
create some slimes and films you're not

421
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,560
going to know what's going on

422
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,320
the only time i will say microbes are

423
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:25,439
are effective in the water culture

424
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,440
specifically so like your deep water

425
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,560
culture your aeroponics your sprinkle

426
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,600
irrigation all that fun stuff

427
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:35,838
the only time that you really are

428
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,639
i feel microorganisms are effective is

429
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,760
using them as as bio pesticides you know

430
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,440
trichoderma certain strains of bacillus

431
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,519
produce antifungal antibacterial

432
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,959
compounds that you can put like a root

433
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,799
shield or

434
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,919
um

435
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,519
bavaria rasciana with the

436
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,120
botanic gear right but to handguard

437
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,959
sorry

438
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,440
all those are really good for protecting

439
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,799
the root system killing any type of pest

440
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,800
that might be in the root system but i

441
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,240
wouldn't be using any type of nutrient

442
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,000
cycling bacteria or any type of

443
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,519
mycorrhizae in a water culture synthetic

444
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,360
system

445
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,600
my second part of this is like if you

446
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,039
use a substrate medium like cocoa

447
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,879
rockwool

448
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,559
peat and it's all inert still

449
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,958
hydroponics but you have a substrate for

450
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,719
them for the organisms to live within

451
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,759
and here is where you find

452
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,839
um the the usefulness of microorganisms

453
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,720
i feel

454
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:32,480
mycorrhizaes it it can it can it can be

455
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,920
helpful it can be handy um it you know

456
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,920
you

457
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:38,000
with mycorrhizae it requires an

458
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,360
insoluble phosphorus source

459
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,958
and then the mycorrhizae takes that

460
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,240
insulin like rock phosphate it takes

461
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,159
that insoluble

462
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,240
rock phosphate and it digests it and

463
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,759
breaks it down and then it's connected

464
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,198
intravenously within the plants and then

465
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,000
it just injects the phosphorus in there

466
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,359
when you're using synthetic phosphates

467
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,600
you're not giving the mycorrhizae any

468
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,240
food you know you're not giving it any

469
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,399
any any of its natural function to

470
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,399
actually survive inside the median so i

471
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,078
i don't really think mycorrhizae is a

472
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,720
good choice when you're using synthetic

473
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:08,559
hydroponics um and then when you have

474
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,759
the nutrient cycling bacteria plant

475
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:13,518
growth proposing promoting rhizobacteria

476
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,680
they release natural hormones around the

477
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,399
root system to increase root production

478
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,879
they can help stabilize the ph you don't

479
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,399
get ph fluctuations throughout your your

480
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:26,879
synthetic crop cycle you

481
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,958
you know it can also help break down

482
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,600
if salts do end up binding together and

483
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,359
locking you out or you know coming

484
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,440
together and

485
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,959
creating some precipitate

486
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,279
molecules in there you start to see the

487
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,359
white crust on the top of your substrate

488
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,439
the the natural the nutrient cycling

489
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,278
bacteria like the bacillus can help

490
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,759
break that down and alleviate lockout

491
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,278
and just keep ppm steady

492
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,879
so it really depends on what you're

493
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:52,879
trying to do

494
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,120
it's very much of a dynamic

495
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:58,240
answer i guess

496
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,078
but i mean using slf 100 enzymes always

497
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,399
good it just keeps everything clean it

498
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:05,918
keeps everything broken down

499
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:08,078
we have a product called flush um it's a

500
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,400
weak organic acid use those to keep

501
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,879
everything broken down um i don't really

502
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,919
suggest going really hardcore with the

503
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,039
microorganisms inside a synthetic system

504
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,679
okay so you mentioned hydroponic system

505
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:24,000
in our mediums you wouldn't necessarily

506
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,640
go towards using microbes but how about

507
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,119
soil you did mention some benefits that

508
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,799
really microbes can be useful in soil

509
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,599
when using synthetic nutrients is that

510
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:33,679
right

511
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,839
yeah i mean i i try to steer away from

512
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,000
using synthetics in any type of soil

513
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:40,959
just because you have a rhizosphere an

514
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
environment in the root zone where you

515
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,759
need to take care of certain

516
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,119
microorganisms and sometimes they can be

517
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:46,720
really sensitive to synthetic

518
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,558
fertilizers

519
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,480
most the time nutrient cycling bacteria

520
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,000
are okay with it

521
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,919
sometimes you can really impact a

522
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,919
mycorrhizal network by using high

523
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,919
phosphates

524
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,400
but you know if it comes to water

525
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,559
culture i stay away from everything

526
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,640
microorganisms related outside of bio

527
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,000
pesticides you know your trichodermas

528
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,840
your bacillus your antifungal

529
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,400
antibacterials

530
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:13,119
if you're in an inert medium like cocoa

531
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,640
like peat rockwool

532
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,479
i like to throw in nutrient cycling

533
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,720
bacteria for their ability to create

534
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,880
hormones around the root zone cycle

535
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,079
nutrients stabilize the ph

536
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,840
if i'm in soil i am a i go very very

537
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:29,119
heavy with microorganisms and try to

538
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:31,839
stay away from salts as much as i can

539
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:34,399
salts will can tank out the microbial

540
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:36,879
sphere that you've created

541
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,720
so you know keep it keep it organic soil

542
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,240
is supposed to be a slower uptake

543
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,400
anyways and that's why you rely on the

544
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,319
microorganisms to kind of be the

545
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,360
the fuel in the car the gas pedal you

546
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,200
know

547
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:50,558
the more microbes you usually put inside

548
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,120
in into an environment you know within

549
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:55,200
good means uh the better off your your

550
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,639
soils do because they can break down all

551
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,400
the amendments that are unavailable to

552
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,559
the plant that actually goes right into

553
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,320
my next question which is you know in a

554
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:03,918
lot of organic growing books and your

555
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,159
documentaries and stuff synthetic

556
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,520
nutrients kill killing off microbes and

557
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,200
then you got people on the opposing side

558
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,519
of things that say no synthetic

559
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,679
nutrients microbes actually consume

560
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:16,079
those so do synthetic nutrients really

561
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,000
kill microbes or is that bro science

562
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,399
ah it's gross science really

563
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,119
listen these microbes i think they can

564
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,720
you can put a microbial spore on like a

565
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,798
bacterial spore fungal spore on a

566
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,720
meteorite shoot that meteorite to pluto

567
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,200
and as long as pluto has an environment

568
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,160
that is conducive to microorganisms

569
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,000
being alive the proper oxygen proper co2

570
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,600
all the all the food sources and things

571
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
like that it'll come alive

572
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,240
i mean we use spore forming uh

573
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,679
bacteriums all the time our bacteria all

574
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,759
the time you know with uh with our our

575
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,320
teas and they can reason these spores

576
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,079
themselves can resist 2000 ppm of

577
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:54,960
synthetic fertilizer they can withstand

578
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:57,038
a ph swing of 4.0 to 9.0

579
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,558
um they can you know as long as they

580
00:19:57,038 --> 00:19:59,759
have a conducive environment to

581
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:01,279
germinate

582
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,519
these microbes will come alive and

583
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:04,720
actually some of these nutrient cycling

584
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,440
strains and

585
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,759
subspecies of bacteria we were finding

586
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,679
actually solubilized some of these salts

587
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:13,759
a lot of soil remediations that we've

588
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,080
been that i've been doing throughout my

589
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:18,319
decade of experience in agriculture we

590
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,960
use microorganisms to remediate high

591
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,879
salinity soils so it's kind of gross

592
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,159
science just to be like oh all microbes

593
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,000
die whenever you put synthetic

594
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,000
fertilizers on there that's not true

595
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,359
it's very much of a gray area yes some

596
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,119
are super sensitive but some are

597
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,639
actually really resistant

598
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,399
resilient to these chemicals they're

599
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,440
putting down actually can help synthetic

600
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,759
systems

601
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,000
got it okay another thing that people

602
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,720
get caught up on is ph adjusters like

603
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,240
using ph up and ph down just for the

604
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,759
audience i've asked these questions to

605
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,679
other people as well

606
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,279
on the podcast i like to ask multiple

607
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,880
people this questions you know and see

608
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,558
if the see if the answers vary a little

609
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,720
bit so far they've been about the same

610
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:57,918
but ph adjusters you know so people

611
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,480
commonly use for ph down phosphoric acid

612
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,480
ph of people commonly use it's usually a

613
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,558
potassium hydroxide or a potassium

614
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,480
carbonate people swear that if you're

615
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,639
using those

616
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,919
to adjust your water or nutrient

617
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,360
solution

618
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,000
you know once you pour that into medium

619
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:17,678
you're killing off microbes

620
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,880
what are your thoughts on that uh so

621
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,840
no

622
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,919
um really it comes down to is it's so

623
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,959
funny how some of these

624
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,200
um isms as i call it kind of spun up a

625
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,880
couple different ways as the years go on

626
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,519
um but so

627
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,760
adjusting your ph up and down with

628
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,119
phosphoric acid strong acids strong

629
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,279
bases

630
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:41,439
isn't going to tank out your soil is it

631
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:44,240
the thing about soil is that you have

632
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,080
what we call a buffering index this

633
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,720
buffering index

634
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:51,359
is what counteracts the acidity or the

635
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,759
alkalinity inside your soil

636
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,678
that the organic matter inside your soil

637
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,599
the compost the worm castings all those

638
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,840
are buffering agents that are going to

639
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:02,399
help protect the living organisms inside

640
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,158
the soil now what i will say with that

641
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,480
when you're making compost teas like

642
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,480
brewed compost teas like you put your

643
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,839
your worm castings your compost with

644
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,558
your molasses in your water and you

645
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,480
aerate it for 24 hours you just create a

646
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:17,119
living network of like a called a

647
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,720
biofilm it's a long network of bacteria

648
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,119
layered on top of each other it creates

649
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,600
these long strands of filaments

650
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:26,399
when you start because it's already took

651
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:28,558
24 hours to condition itself it's at its

652
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,880
optimal ph it's consuming the

653
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,200
carbohydrates at an optimal level when

654
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,080
you take that and then you start upping

655
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,080
ph upping and ph downing the the the

656
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,399
colony the living colony of brood

657
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,480
bacteria and fungi that you just created

658
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,360
yes you will impact it

659
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,679
if you

660
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:48,479
just just general stance if you brew a

661
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,320
compost tea do not adjust the ph

662
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,159
i don't care if it's 5 5 i don't care if

663
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:54,000
it's 6-0 i don't care if it's 7.

664
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,880
whatever it is put it inside your medium

665
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,798
and the buffering index inside your soil

666
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,640
will figure out where it wants the

667
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:02,798
proper ph to be

668
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,799
um so if you're using a brood compost

669
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:07,038
tea yes it will

670
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,400
it will harm phosphoric acid will harm

671
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:10,480
the bacterial network

672
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,280
if you're using an instant tea like all

673
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,519
these instant microbials like our easy t

674
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,200
we use bacterial spores it's like i just

675
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,759
kind of just just went over like those

676
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,880
can withstand high ph swings so if you

677
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,759
need a ph in instant micro microbial

678
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
mix

679
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,200
um

680
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,200
you know

681
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:32,079
you'll be fine um

682
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:34,319
if you use a liquid inoculate like a

683
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,000
microbe life i would treat it like a

684
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,240
living like you just brewed a tea

685
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,798
because they are living organisms

686
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,278
um and the other thing is like i guess

687
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:45,759
the latter part of this conversation is

688
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:49,278
it's really really really really hard to

689
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:51,919
kill microorganisms with uh ph swings

690
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:54,000
they don't really die they go dormant

691
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,080
you know and i i feel like it's a lot of

692
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,319
things in our industries is

693
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,158
overly oversimplified

694
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:02,639
and um

695
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,320
and as we you know do these podcasts and

696
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,360
as we do watch youtube videos you have

697
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,359
people doing different gardening

698
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:10,639
segments the telephone game can kind of

699
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:12,719
happen so just just i guess uh just a

700
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,559
side note you know it doesn't bacterial

701
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,720
won't die because you put it in an

702
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,158
improper ph it's gonna go dormant and

703
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,919
it's gonna wait till the ph range gets

704
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,919
in a proper range that the bacteria can

705
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,799
come back alive and then it'll regain

706
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,400
function

707
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:25,759
okay that makes sense a lot of good

708
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,360
information there

709
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:29,679
one more follow-up on that so the people

710
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:32,158
that swear that you should be using an

711
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,240
organic method for ph up or ph down like

712
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,480
for example ph down they swear you

713
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,120
should use lemon juice or vinegar

714
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,278
instead of phosphoric acid or they swear

715
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:44,479
that you should be using baking soda for

716
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:46,400
ph up instead of the potassium hydroxide

717
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,798
or potassium carbonate would you agree

718
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,440
with that disagree with that

719
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:53,119
i you know it really depends on your

720
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,840
medium if

721
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:58,399
you're in a very sterile hydroponic

722
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,079
medium those strong strong acids are

723
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,159
strong bases the hydroxides the

724
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:04,879
phosphoric acid those are fine

725
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,200
they will work just fine um if you're in

726
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,679
this in a soil i do recommend and you

727
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,919
have like a if you have a living micro

728
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,480
micro organism

729
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,480
environment to be concerned about

730
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,038
go with the weak the weak acids the weak

731
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,640
bases so it's like citric acid like your

732
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:22,879
lemon juice your

733
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,360
acetic acid your vinegars those are all

734
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,200
weak acids that won't harm your skin

735
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,359
our flush is actually a weak organic

736
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,640
acid and you can put on your skin it's

737
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,240
actually a great

738
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,559
skin cleaner

739
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,319
but so it's so gentle

740
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:38,319
that it will it won't

741
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,079
harm your skin it won't harm any type of

742
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,158
the the organisms

743
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,599
if you're using any type of ph up like i

744
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,440
said hydroxides work in a sterile

745
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:48,639
environment i don't like introducing

746
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,159
hydroxides into my organic systems

747
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,880
it also goes with

748
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,320
the

749
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,360
kelp extracts the 1 0 18 kelp extracts

750
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,759
are

751
00:25:55,359 --> 00:26:00,319
kelp is organic can be used in organic

752
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:02,798
systems but that 18 potassium is

753
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,798
strictly from potassium hydroxide

754
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:07,200
i would recommend putting that inside of

755
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,798
a organic system because hydroxides if

756
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,759
you're going to do it use carbonates

757
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,558
calcium carbonate potassium carbonate if

758
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:13,440
you're

759
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,158
you know

760
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,240
trying to ph up limestone

761
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,200
is liquid like calcium carbonate

762
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,400
potassium carbonate those are all good

763
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,159
alternatives to those really heavy

764
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,798
chemicals that you can use in like

765
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,080
synthetic hydroponic systems okay gotcha

766
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:30,158
i think that's a pretty good transition

767
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,439
into your product line so i forgot to

768
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,278
talk about some of the bro science first

769
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,798
growth science to start then we'll get

770
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:36,400
into your product line so some people

771
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,038
aren't like oh this is just an hour-long

772
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,120
infomercial his product line uh but you

773
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:44,079
know it really intrigues me you know you

774
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:46,558
have a you've developed an organic

775
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:50,319
fertilizer that's 100 water soluble yes

776
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:52,960
so you have a gross 360 a bloom 360. you

777
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:55,038
also have the pk blossom the calcium and

778
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,919
the flush you want to talk to us about

779
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:58,158
you know

780
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,000
what's in the grow 360 and bloom 360 how

781
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:03,360
those work sure

782
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
um so the is a true one part fertilizing

783
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:08,719
system it's a one part vegetative base

784
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,079
it's a one-part balloon base um first

785
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,679
and foremost what i want to do is get

786
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,079
away from the six to twenty bottles

787
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,880
people have to constantly mix and be a

788
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:18,558
cocktail mad chemist you know

789
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,640
um so i want to keep it as simple as

790
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:23,359
possible so if you just need to just

791
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,799
grow your plants as simple as possible

792
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,319
you can just take these two products and

793
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:28,960
it has all your macros all your

794
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:31,519
secondaries all your trace elements

795
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,200
one's just arranged for a the vegetative

796
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:34,879
stage and the other is for the blooming

797
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,080
and fruiting stage

798
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,278
um

799
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:41,918
with that i we use zero nitrates we only

800
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:44,000
use protein nitrogen uh we don't use any

801
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,120
laby phosphates it's all rock phosphate

802
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,359
so we talked about earlier about

803
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,519
mycorrhizae needing food source well

804
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,359
rock phosphate is the is the food source

805
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,240
from mycorrhizae rock phosphates in all

806
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:53,359
of our

807
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,038
indigenous

808
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:56,000
soils and on earth

809
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,000
um

810
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,480
then on top of that we use calcium

811
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,278
carbonate and magnesium sulfate both

812
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,120
those having uh attached to amino acids

813
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:07,599
so they're amino based and then our

814
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,519
trace elements i don't use any edta

815
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,599
chelated anything and that's where we

816
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:14,480
talk about being plants being force-fed

817
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,759
we're like these edta chelated molecules

818
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,759
they don't care what the plant wants at

819
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,278
any time they just go into the plant

820
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,720
guess what their job is

821
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:22,480
so a lot of the times you get that harsh

822
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,798
burning and it's because of lab made

823
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,120
phosphates being really harsh it's from

824
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:29,119
edta chelated micronutrients that you're

825
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:30,639
in the week seven a flower six of flower

826
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:31,918
and those are still being shoved into

827
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,000
the plant whether you want them to or

828
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,080
not so what i want to do and what i

829
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,960
searched out is i wanted to use amino

830
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:41,199
humic based trace elements so it's iron

831
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,480
sulfate manganese sulfate copper so all

832
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,480
the sulfate based molecules of the trace

833
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,558
elements but they're digested and and

834
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,519
chelated to amino acids and humic acids

835
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:53,440
so you get the the ionic uptake like

836
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,440
uptake like you do with like the edta

837
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,919
chelated trace elements but it's in a

838
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,558
form that's wrapped in carbon

839
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,399
the carbon molecules humic acids amino

840
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,558
acids and the the biggest thing i wanted

841
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:06,000
to do with this is most nutrient lines

842
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:09,038
are nitrate based

843
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,278
we wanted to be carbon based nitrates

844
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,278
elongate the plant cell nitrates to grow

845
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:14,798
plant matter

846
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:16,558
and which is good when you're trying to

847
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:17,918
vegetatively grow a plant but when

848
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:19,918
you're trying to

849
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,840
have the plant synthesize

850
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,880
other molecules like terpenes and

851
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:27,918
flavonoids and cannabinoids all of those

852
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,278
are carbon based so the limiting factor

853
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,038
for the plant to be able to produce

854
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:33,200
those is going to be the amount of

855
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,278
carbon you give a plant

856
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,278
so i wanted to make a nutrient line that

857
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:38,880
was that was carbon based where

858
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:40,640
everything is wrapped in a carbon ring

859
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,960
so one is microbial food source when

860
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,038
you're putting it into an organic system

861
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,558
it's it's a microbial food two i wanted

862
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,440
it to be bioavailable so if you put it

863
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:52,480
into a hydroponic system it's still 100

864
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,720
by bioavailable plant nutrients

865
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,038
so these two bases really encompassed

866
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,720
your amino acids your seaweed extracts

867
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:00,319
and your humic acids along with all of

868
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,679
your macro secondaries and trace

869
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:04,079
elements

870
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,759
um so that's our base fertilizing system

871
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:08,079
then you have the supplements

872
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:10,558
you have the calcium which is an organic

873
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:13,519
calmag uses calcium carbonate magnesium

874
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:16,720
sulfate that's digested into amino acids

875
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:19,359
so it's a protein sulfate based

876
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,120
calcium product so a lot of times we use

877
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:24,879
calmag inside um these synthetic systems

878
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,719
are all nitrate based so when you're

879
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,880
using them heavy in flour it causes a

880
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,480
bunch of fox tailing and your flowers

881
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,960
you get a lot of

882
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,960
airiness to them

883
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,480
with this you have proteins and proteins

884
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,720
and calcium all go to building strong

885
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,720
structure in your in your flowers strong

886
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,798
structure in your plant cells

887
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,200
the fact that there's a three percent

888
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:48,879
sulfate charge on there sulfur is in

889
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,640
every single terpene

890
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,240
so it's a it's a limiting factor for

891
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,600
your terpene production based on how

892
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,159
much sulfur you have going into the

893
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:58,079
plant so it's a it's a cow mag product

894
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,240
that's that's kind of designed to be

895
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:01,599
used heavily in flour when you need it

896
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,319
the most

897
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:07,359
but won't cause the fox tailing and

898
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,720
goes to really fortifying the plant

899
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:10,879
um

900
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,079
the last of the supplements is pk

901
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,840
blossom

902
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,038
this is an organic bloom booster

903
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,720
essentially

904
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:18,798
i wanted to

905
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,200
take micronized rock phosphate potassium

906
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:23,599
sulfate and calcium carbonate and put

907
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,278
them into a concentrated product so

908
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:26,158
you don't have to use

909
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:28,000
uh

910
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,679
mother of all blooms moab you don't have

911
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,079
to use cool bloom you don't have to use

912
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,080
all these synthetic

913
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:36,158
bloom boosters you get the the the

914
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:40,158
flowers to grow to get you know the

915
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:41,679
plant to really set in in um and enlarge

916
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,640
and ripen

917
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,320
throughout its flowering cycle

918
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,320
and last but certainly not least is our

919
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:51,200
flush product um probably one of my

920
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:53,918
favorite products uh uses a weak organic

921
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,000
acid called hydroxycarboxylic acid

922
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,080
um a lot of these flushing agents like

923
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,679
cleanse out there like drip clean

924
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:01,678
they're all forms of bleach so when you

925
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,798
put them into your system yes they might

926
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,880
remove

927
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:07,918
the the build the salt buildup it might

928
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,600
remove all these um excess materials

929
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,320
inside your substrate but it literally

930
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,240
sterilizes it nukes your entire

931
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:15,599
rhizosphere so all of your mycorrhizae

932
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,960
all the microbes you've been using

933
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:20,240
throughout your entire

934
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,679
um growth cycle it you put cleanse in

935
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,159
there any of these bleach flushing

936
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,320
agents and it completely nukes out any

937
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,159
and any microbes and you just end up

938
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,000
wasting your money so i want to do is

939
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,278
make a flushing agent that was one

940
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,319
carbon base to kind of go with this

941
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:37,519
whole carbon-based fertilizing system

942
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:38,720
but two make it safe for microorganisms

943
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,720
and it's probably one of the most

944
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,798
diverse products we have it's a water

945
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,000
conditioner so if you have hard water it

946
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:46,480
breaks apart the carbonates and

947
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,679
bicarbonates and makes it soft water

948
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,759
in the soil just it just acts as a soil

949
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,360
conditioner adds porosity to soil so it

950
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,278
prevents compaction so it's great for

951
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,359
those no-till guys

952
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:59,440
that over time how you get the the

953
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:01,038
compacted soils and we're dealing with

954
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,320
annual flowers we're not dealing with

955
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:04,558
perennials we're not dealing with

956
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,720
ornamentals these plants don't like a

957
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:09,440
hard compact soil they want the aeration

958
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,319
they want the porosity so this flushing

959
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,919
agent this flush allows porosity to

960
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:18,079
happen within the soil itself and the

961
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,240
the third part is that it also acts as a

962
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:22,480
nutrient key later so if you add it to

963
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,319
your reservoirs whether using salts or

964
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,919
whether you're using organics it helps

965
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:28,398
break everything down and chelate and

966
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,399
attach itself to

967
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:31,918
these these molecules so the plant

968
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:33,599
recognizes it as

969
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,360
since you know it's a car it's a

970
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:36,959
carbon-based acid so when it attaches

971
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:39,119
itself the plant can tell it has a

972
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,960
carbon has carbon attached to it so

973
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,959
plant goes oh i know carbon is and grabs

974
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,640
it in so it makes your nutrients more

975
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,079
bioavailable

976
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,000
when you use it with your with your

977
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,599
feeds i think he pretty much answered my

978
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,839
next question which is is this product

979
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:55,278
line usable with all water types so rain

980
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:56,879
water tap water ro it sounds like it is

981
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:59,038
and it sounds like even if you're using

982
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,600
tap water it's got chlorine in it it's

983
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,720
got chloramine in it that you can still

984
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:04,959
use that

985
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,319
yep and the cool thing about these base

986
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,000
fertilizers because they have humic

987
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:08,960
acids in them

988
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,800
they

989
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,280
they buffer out chlor

990
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,720
chlorine and chloramine so they can

991
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,320
actually help buffer some of the tap

992
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,239
water so when you're putting these

993
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,800
organic fertilizers into your tap water

994
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:23,039
and putting those into your soil system

995
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,039
you can actually help reduce the impact

996
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,599
of chlorine and chloramine just by using

997
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,119
the base fertilizers that's interesting

998
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,559
that's so cool

999
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:35,039
now ph is a big topic specifically one

1000
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:37,759
talks about you know synthetic nutrients

1001
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,679
you want them to be in a proper ph range

1002
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,280
so the the plant can uptake you know

1003
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,200
same thing with organics they need to be

1004
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,879
in that certain range now

1005
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,878
what is your overall thoughts on

1006
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:48,078
monitoring ph when growing organic

1007
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:50,799
there's so many people out there that

1008
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,760
say completely ignore ph whatever water

1009
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,440
you have

1010
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,879
put in there the microbes are going to

1011
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,119
adjust it then there are other people

1012
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:59,759
that say no you still want to make sure

1013
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,800
you're putting the proper ph into the

1014
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,400
medium

1015
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,760
in order for the plant to be able to

1016
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,760
update the nutrients for the microbes to

1017
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,400
be able to work properly

1018
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,560
what's your thoughts on that so i

1019
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,800
still like to keep everything in the

1020
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,279
soil system between six five and seven

1021
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,960
five and usually most of these these

1022
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,400
agents that you're using or

1023
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,440
products you're using are going to keep

1024
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,838
it there

1025
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,358
um but i mean

1026
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:26,400
compost teas go down to five five

1027
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:27,838
sometimes and i don't recommend ph those

1028
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,280
you know the soil will figure everything

1029
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:30,880
out the whole thing about an organic

1030
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,079
system is that you're relying on your

1031
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,960
soil the microorganisms the organic

1032
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,960
matter

1033
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,920
um the amendments you're relying on

1034
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,240
those the limestone to like to buffer

1035
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,838
and to keep everything stable so nectar

1036
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:45,519
for the gods for example everything in

1037
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:47,358
there is all fermented and everything in

1038
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,880
there is extremely acidic

1039
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:49,838
you know you still need to keep it up

1040
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,280
and and

1041
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:53,679
raise the ph and they have a liquid

1042
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,359
limestone product that works great but

1043
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:56,719
once it goes into the soil you're still

1044
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:58,159
going to have the high amount of

1045
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:00,399
hydrogen ions that's what creates

1046
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:03,199
something acidic it's high hydrogen

1047
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,680
high amounts of hydrogen ions and

1048
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:08,799
what creates it alkaline is high amount

1049
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,639
of hydroxide ions so you can buffer it

1050
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,400
and you can get a stable ph and get an

1051
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:15,039
equilibrium but you're still going to

1052
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,200
put these these high amounts of hydrogen

1053
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,480
ions that you just buffered up you're

1054
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:19,919
still going to put them into your soil

1055
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,519
and the soil is still going to react

1056
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,039
with them so the biggest thing about all

1057
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:24,880
these organic systems i wouldn't worry

1058
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,960
too much about ph definitely don't do

1059
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,280
anything crazy that's gonna like ph of

1060
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,720
like 10 or 12 that's gonna you know

1061
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,680
throws anything out of whack don't put

1062
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:36,239
anything a ph of four or lower in there

1063
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:37,039
um but if you can stay between

1064
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:39,838
the

1065
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:41,838
five five to seven five range the soil

1066
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:45,119
will buffer and figure itself out you

1067
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:47,039
know so you gotta rely you're creating a

1068
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,280
ecosystem and you have to be able to

1069
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,599
rely on that and not be

1070
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,280
you know constantly at the wheel all the

1071
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,359
time of trying to make sure everything's

1072
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,839
perfect well said

1073
00:36:55,358 --> 00:37:00,400
let's flip it up let's talk about pgrs

1074
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:01,920
so plant growth regulators

1075
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,440
so some people hear about pgrs and they

1076
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,680
automatically think bad

1077
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,240
bad never use pgrs

1078
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:10,480
everything about pgrs is bad yeah i have

1079
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:13,039
trouble saying this word but plaquetrill

1080
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,199
butrazole i i just struggle saying that

1081
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:17,599
word for some reason that's the one pgr

1082
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:20,078
that is really bad right that's uh

1083
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,200
carciogenic related to cancer

1084
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,039
talk to us there are good pgrs natural

1085
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:28,078
pgrs within the plan talk to us a little

1086
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:29,199
bit about pgrs the good and the bad

1087
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,320
so

1088
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:34,719
sure absolutely so uh paclo for example

1089
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,119
is a bad pgr pgr for those who don't

1090
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:40,719
know plant growth regulators it's

1091
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:43,358
hormones whether it's

1092
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:45,519
it's it's a hormones that that

1093
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:48,000
control and direct a function within the

1094
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:50,159
plant so a bush load has paclo in it

1095
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,838
right so these you go to the ornaments

1096
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:54,399
you find you go to ornamental nurturing

1097
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:56,078
you see all these shrubs the same height

1098
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,079
you see them all the same width you see

1099
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,000
all these perfect shrubs

1100
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,760
shrubs by themselves do not want to do

1101
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,679
that they do the same thing as most

1102
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,240
annuals plants do they have a pickle

1103
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:08,480
dominant side and you'll see one branch

1104
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:11,118
go way up and the rest of the shrub will

1105
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,159
be like kind of lopsided we spray paclo

1106
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,400
on it

1107
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,159
and what happens is it regulates the

1108
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,000
hormonal function of the plant so it

1109
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:21,598
gets rid of the pickle dominance and the

1110
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,159
pickle dominance is derived from auxins

1111
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,400
the the one of the five plant hormones

1112
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:28,399
uh naturally occurring within the plant

1113
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,358
so paclo goes in there tells the plant

1114
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,800
to stop doing that and to and to grow

1115
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:35,039
more lateral

1116
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,079
than to grow vertical

1117
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:38,800
in

1118
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,720
the old 90s hydroponic days you'd spray

1119
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,720
your plants right before you go into

1120
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:45,439
bloom all of them stay horizontal you

1121
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,399
kick it you kick down the stretch

1122
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,880
by

1123
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,960
almost no you have almost zero stretch

1124
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,640
you kick it down almost all the way and

1125
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,358
you have these nice little

1126
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:57,358
fat you know

1127
00:38:55,358 --> 00:39:00,159
bushes across the way

1128
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:02,880
um the thing about this and what i don't

1129
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:04,719
like about pgrs is most pgrs are

1130
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,079
carcinogenic

1131
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:10,480
so most they're cancer-causing and you

1132
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,519
know when you're using ornamental plants

1133
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,199
you're not

1134
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:14,480
people use these chemicals on them and

1135
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:16,799
you're not like you're not eating an

1136
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,039
ornamental plant you're not smoking an

1137
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,039
ornamental plant you know it's very much

1138
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:23,119
one of these things of like it's it's

1139
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:24,719
used for kind of like a

1140
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,200
hands-off you're going to look at the

1141
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:30,000
plant type of situation when we go into

1142
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:32,239
consumable crops then we have an issue

1143
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,599
with these pgrs becoming cancer-causing

1144
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:35,358
because we're literally ingesting them

1145
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,440
and these half-lifes are

1146
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:39,199
sometimes six months six to 12 months at

1147
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,079
a time so by the time you finish a cycle

1148
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,279
it's still

1149
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:45,920
existing within the plant um

1150
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,800
you know it's really important to to

1151
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,159
know that pgrs are

1152
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,760
bad

1153
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,598
but it's also important to understand

1154
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:58,160
and this is where i kind of

1155
00:39:53,599 --> 00:40:00,240
afco is a overlying agency that we have

1156
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:01,838
to work within they decide what your

1157
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,318
heavy metals are

1158
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:06,960
the government agency that dictates

1159
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,318
what fertilizers what agents ingredients

1160
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,318
we can use

1161
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:11,920
in these in our inner fertilizer

1162
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:14,079
products that we sell you

1163
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,920
uh most these pg all these pgrs are

1164
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,560
under the pesticide branch

1165
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,400
so they're they're

1166
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:23,119
very much um

1167
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,440
restricted and they have a very strict

1168
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,559
standard in which you have to use them

1169
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,159
there's protocols to them however i i

1170
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:31,838
argue with the government officials

1171
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:33,118
about this i believe

1172
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:35,679
that there are

1173
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,519
plant growth promoters and plant growth

1174
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:38,960
regulators

1175
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:40,318
you have

1176
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,440
for example you have the paclo the

1177
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:46,239
synthetic hormones you also have

1178
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,159
kelp extracts which has natural hormones

1179
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:50,559
in them alfalfa has natural plant

1180
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:54,000
hormones in them and this we have to get

1181
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:57,119
into like the the the monotony of

1182
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,800
what is regulating the growth of a plant

1183
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,960
and what is just promoting the growth of

1184
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,079
the plant because not all hormones that

1185
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:08,159
are category categorized as pgrs are

1186
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,960
what i consider pgrs so um

1187
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:12,879
paclo is a growth regulator

1188
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,280
plant growth promoters is why i call

1189
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,119
them pgps and those are the natural

1190
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,720
hormones you get from plant extracts

1191
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,559
algae extracts seaweed extracts alfalfa

1192
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,559
even amino acids have a plant growth

1193
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:26,239
promoting effect

1194
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:27,759
those are okay and those are safe to use

1195
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:29,118
i recommend using those because those

1196
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,359
don't control

1197
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,200
and tell the plant to stop doing a

1198
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:34,960
natural function and do this abnormal

1199
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,559
thing like paclo or bushload does where

1200
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,358
it just levels out the canopy and gets

1201
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:42,719
rid of the pickle dominance they they

1202
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:44,400
promote the stage at which the plants in

1203
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:46,959
so when

1204
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,440
i use seaweed extract when the plant is

1205
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,039
vegetatively growing it's going to help

1206
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,480
develop more nodes it's going to help

1207
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:54,079
lateral branching it's not going to tell

1208
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,838
the plant just to stop growing and just

1209
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,079
to rearrange its entire hormonal

1210
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:58,960
structure alfalfa as well they're plant

1211
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,280
growth promoters they're going to

1212
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,880
promote whatever stage the plant is in

1213
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,359
and those what i want really the

1214
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,760
delineation between the pgrs and pgps to

1215
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:09,119
occur i want people to look for pgps

1216
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,599
because those are actually what we can

1217
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,519
use to increase crop production without

1218
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,838
using any type of carcinogens to kind of

1219
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:18,318
harm harm our bodies to harm the people

1220
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:19,920
we are we're providing medicine to

1221
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:21,920
lots of good info there thanks for

1222
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,480
breaking that down for us let's move on

1223
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,000
to light cycle particularly the 24 hour

1224
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,079
light cycle so there's a lot of people

1225
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,599
that say 24-hour light cycle is the best

1226
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,880
light cycle for vegetative growth

1227
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,640
because you're going to have that

1228
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,400
photosynthesis going and going and going

1229
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,480
and going people on the opposing side

1230
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,240
says that the plant needs the period of

1231
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,000
darkness now there have been studies

1232
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:42,318
that particularly on the the period of

1233
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,800
darkness toward things that happen down

1234
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:46,400
below this you know in the soil microbes

1235
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,160
you know exudates are being released

1236
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,318
during the darkness period can you give

1237
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:53,039
us your overall thoughts on the 24 hour

1238
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:54,719
light cycle is it bad i'm not a fan of

1239
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,199
it um

1240
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,639
i like to give plant to rest period

1241
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:00,480
because as soon as the lights turn off

1242
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:02,639
you have a whole bunch of hormones being

1243
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,719
rerouted down to the root zone um

1244
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,318
abscisic acid so there's five plant

1245
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:08,639
hormones there's

1246
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:11,279
cytokinins there's

1247
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:15,039
um auxins there's gibberellins there's

1248
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,040
abscissic acid and ethylene

1249
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,400
normally when you're seeing the top

1250
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,920
growth in the canopy you're looking at

1251
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,280
cellular elongation

1252
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,039
oxygen you're looking at cellular

1253
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,160
division cytokinins you're looking at

1254
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:28,239
cellular bulking which is gibralans um

1255
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:30,480
but what happens below the subsurface of

1256
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:32,639
the soil yet the roots are releasing

1257
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,119
abscisic acid and ethylene

1258
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:38,078
back and forth to grow left to grow

1259
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,680
right to go down to grow up so that that

1260
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,440
darkness period i like to give it to

1261
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:44,000
plants because the plant is allowed to

1262
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,720
hormonally rearrange itself naturally

1263
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,599
and actually use those those hormones in

1264
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:51,358
the root zone um to to do its natural

1265
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,318
function that it would do during in

1266
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:57,199
nature you know naturally gotcha okay

1267
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:59,199
and now kind of piggybacking off of that

1268
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:01,118
some people do an extended darkness

1269
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:03,759
period before flowering now this comes

1270
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,358
down to phytochrome pr and the awake

1271
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,319
state sleep state

1272
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:10,159
pfr when pfr accumulates more than pr

1273
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:12,239
the plant starts making fluorine

1274
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:14,559
fluoride is the flowering hormone so

1275
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:17,039
it's often said that giving your p your

1276
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:19,039
plant a period of darkness an extended

1277
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:21,838
period some people do 36 hours of

1278
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:24,159
darkness between vegetative and

1279
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:26,159
flowering that's going to help them

1280
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:28,639
accumulate more pfr

1281
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:30,559
make more flourigen transition to flower

1282
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:32,239
faster was that all correct what i just

1283
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:34,159
said there and and

1284
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:35,118
you know is that true or not what are

1285
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:37,358
your thoughts

1286
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,920
so theoretically yes on on paper and

1287
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:42,000
textbook that is how the plant

1288
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,599
does its dark cycles and how it

1289
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,559
rearranges itself

1290
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,760
um

1291
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:51,358
the problem the issue we get into

1292
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:53,839
is and this goes across collegiate

1293
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:55,199
uh studies this goes across third-party

1294
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:58,239
laboratories it goes across the

1295
00:44:55,199 --> 00:45:00,799
government so it's so hard to quantify

1296
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,879
this biochemical reaction to it that's

1297
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,640
occurring and to know what levels are

1298
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,720
where because the plant's constantly

1299
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,639
going through a metabolic change

1300
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:10,719
and this is where the the government

1301
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,960
doesn't like the us to be able to list

1302
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,559
like algae extracts or seaweed extracts

1303
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,838
and say they have hormonal activity

1304
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:17,920
because we spray it on there and then we

1305
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:19,759
can't we don't know we can't quantify

1306
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,200
like yeah we know the plant grows better

1307
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,960
but we don't we are not able to quantify

1308
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:26,960
how much of these hormones are going

1309
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,720
into doing what and what the biochemical

1310
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,679
cascade is doing

1311
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:33,598
you know where we as as as humans are

1312
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:35,279
still still figuring out what these

1313
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,318
plants do and how to quantify them

1314
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,560
properly in an effective manner so i

1315
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:43,039
mean i personally and this is where the

1316
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:46,639
scientist at me comes from i personally

1317
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:47,440
do not know

1318
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:49,199
how

1319
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,599
much flooring is being produced in those

1320
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:54,159
dark cycles i can't i can't tell you yes

1321
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:56,079
for sure that is happening that's where

1322
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:58,078
that's where i would call bro science

1323
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:59,599
you know where we know that this process

1324
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,800
happens so we can extrapolate and be

1325
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,200
like hey

1326
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,119
what if we do this to our plants and

1327
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:06,078
then that theoretical thing would happen

1328
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,400
to them

1329
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,960
you know and so it's like i i like to be

1330
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,838
able to quantify things so

1331
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,318
growth rates uh

1332
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:17,759
uh reproduction lateral branching uh

1333
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:20,960
production weight

1334
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,720
biomass weight usable medicine wait you

1335
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,800
know what i mean i can i i can

1336
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,598
quantifiably touch those things and i

1337
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,960
know

1338
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,359
that's happening but i can't

1339
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,440
quantifiably say that yes i put my plant

1340
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:34,318
in darkness for 36 hours and all of a

1341
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,679
sudden i cut a week off my flower cycle

1342
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:37,920
you know that's where bro science it's

1343
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:39,358
like we extrapolate it and then we apply

1344
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,318
it and we think it does stuff and then

1345
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:42,799
we just keep doing it because that's

1346
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:45,838
what everybody else does you know so bro

1347
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:48,318
science until it can be confirmed as

1348
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:50,480
actual science

1349
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:52,000
exactly

1350
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,358
yeah yeah totally and same thing with

1351
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,199
the the dark cycle at the end of the

1352
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:56,960
plant life i know that i'm sure you're

1353
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:58,639
going to get into that conversation too

1354
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,318
where it's like i

1355
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:02,559
you know the the theory is that the

1356
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:04,880
plant produces more

1357
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:06,719
resin whenever the sun's about to come

1358
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,640
up because anticipating being hit by uv

1359
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:10,719
radiations and the resin glands is

1360
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:13,679
spherical and perfectly spherical where

1361
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:15,919
it diffracts the uv radiations before it

1362
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:17,679
hits the plant tissue so if you leave a

1363
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,119
plant at the end of its life cycle and

1364
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:21,759
darkness you can increase resin

1365
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:23,838
production but again bro science because

1366
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,760
we don't have any quantifiable data and

1367
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:27,440
in the research i've seen that people

1368
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,760
you know take it to a lab and they get

1369
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,760
their their flowers analyzed

1370
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,079
afterwards

1371
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,760
there's no consistent data that shows it

1372
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,359
does increase

1373
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,200
trichome production increases

1374
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:42,480
cannabinoid levels increases alkalate

1375
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:45,838
levels you know we have been able to see

1376
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:48,480
that that drought stress in like peppers

1377
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:51,199
increases capsaicin content

1378
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,639
so you could extrapolate and cross apply

1379
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:54,879
that to

1380
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:56,719
the medicinal plants and be like well if

1381
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,358
it happens here it'll happen there but

1382
00:47:56,719 --> 00:48:01,118
again we don't

1383
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:03,759
we don't there's it's all bro science

1384
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:05,440
they don't have any quantifiable data to

1385
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,119
show yes or no

1386
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,639
i'm glad you brought up the

1387
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,800
darkness before harvesting typically do

1388
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:12,639
people do 48 hours of darkness before

1389
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,400
harvesting last-ditch effort to create

1390
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,199
trichomes but then the opposing side

1391
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,400
says

1392
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:18,159
well even if you do are creating

1393
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,838
trichomes they're not going to that

1394
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:21,838
potent state right there's not enough

1395
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:23,759
time for them to be in that potent state

1396
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:25,279
so i'm glad you kind of clarified that

1397
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,079
as of right now it's bro science until

1398
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,839
we actually have studies done right and

1399
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:32,000
can actually turn it into

1400
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:34,000
actual science potentially now kind of

1401
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,920
going into trichome development you know

1402
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,280
when we talked to mj biz con you talked

1403
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,920
a little bit about trichome development

1404
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,040
you know in detail about

1405
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,000
how

1406
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:46,159
when trichomes develop can you explain

1407
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,639
to us kind of just i guess the life

1408
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:50,000
cycle of the trichome or just everything

1409
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,639
you know about kind of trichome

1410
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,920
development trichomes by themselves are

1411
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:58,400
a defense mechanism that the

1412
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,240
many many plants have to protect

1413
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,680
themselves from bugs

1414
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:03,039
creates a sticky surface so when the

1415
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:05,440
bugs are walking the pests are walking

1416
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:08,159
through they get caught and then they

1417
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,400
they die from lack of water like a food

1418
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:11,679
um etc

1419
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,960
they are

1420
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,799
a

1421
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,119
they contain fragrance molecules that

1422
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,800
attracts and deters certain certain

1423
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,880
pests

1424
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,559
trichomes themselves also usually

1425
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,519
contain

1426
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,720
the alkaloids that everybody uses to

1427
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:30,318
partake in

1428
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:34,000
it starts off as

1429
00:49:30,318 --> 00:49:36,960
you you have a a a stock a basin of it

1430
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,639
and you have a gland on top uh those are

1431
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,119
all silicon based

1432
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:42,719
the the sock to the gland and over time

1433
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,280
the plant starts filling those glands

1434
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:46,558
with oils and starts filling it with

1435
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,960
different alkaloids and whatnot which is

1436
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,960
why you can see it go from clear to

1437
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:55,039
cloudy to amber

1438
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:57,519
because you're watching a biochemical

1439
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:58,558
reaction happen throughout a period of

1440
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:01,039
two months

1441
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,359
um plants naturally haven't even in the

1442
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:05,199
vegetative state same with with tomatoes

1443
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:07,440
and same with the medical plants they

1444
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:07,439
have

1445
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,400
trichomes on them they don't have any

1446
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,400
type of active material in them until

1447
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,000
later on into the stages when the plants

1448
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,920
can biochemically produce that because

1449
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,199
it takes all the hormones and everything

1450
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,480
and the flower cycle to actually

1451
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:24,838
generate those active compounds in them

1452
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,880
the plant starts off with

1453
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:29,039
cbg and that's when you see the clear

1454
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,680
trichome heads um the cbg's are

1455
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:34,239
precursor to all the other cannabinoids

1456
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:35,440
and then it goes into your active ones

1457
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,519
um

1458
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,679
cbd cpg cpc

1459
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:42,318
all all those cannabinoids and then it

1460
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:44,480
all terminates into cbn so when you

1461
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:47,440
start to see the amber that's when you

1462
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,920
start to see that the cbn

1463
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,519
arrangements start to occur the the the

1464
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,280
chemical reaction to turn all those

1465
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,280
actives into

1466
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,480
a more sedating compound

1467
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,680
um

1468
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,159
and then you start to see the glands

1469
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:01,838
start to wither and start to to

1470
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:04,159
wither away and that's usually you know

1471
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:05,838
the pull during peak ripeness

1472
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:07,598
so how long does it take i think you

1473
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:10,400
mentioned two months

1474
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:12,960
for that entire process to happen is

1475
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:16,000
that true it takes two months for the to

1476
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,880
go from clear to cloudy to amber do we

1477
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,159
have like timeline for when it turns it

1478
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,039
it really

1479
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:24,318
that's a general broad stroke um

1480
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:26,480
eight to nine weeks is our general

1481
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:28,400
flower cycle uh for most of our

1482
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,039
commercial cultivars

1483
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,480
that's not how it necessarily works with

1484
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:35,519
um

1485
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,440
16 weeks sativas 18 weeks sativas you

1486
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:40,239
know those will stay

1487
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,760
cbg until

1488
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:43,039
nine weeks and then after nine weeks

1489
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,240
then it'll start to convert into the

1490
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:48,239
active cannabinoids um and then from

1491
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:50,000
there it goes

1492
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:51,598
it takes another two weeks at the end of

1493
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,838
it so it can be 16 weeks of a flower

1494
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:55,920
cycle to get all those all those

1495
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:58,480
cannabinoids to fully mature and fully

1496
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,920
evolve into their peak potential

1497
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,199
so it really depends on you know there's

1498
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:05,680
sometimes there's a five week um

1499
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:07,679
sorry not five weeks it's seven week uh

1500
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:10,000
photo period sometimes you get

1501
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:11,679
uh auto flowers which are five to seven

1502
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,880
weeks throughout the entire thing you

1503
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:14,480
know so it really depends on the

1504
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,160
cultivar and the variety and where it's

1505
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,079
from throughout the world because you

1506
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:21,679
know you have equatorial sativas you

1507
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:23,119
have things in the northern southern um

1508
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:24,960
parts of the world that are going to

1509
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:27,358
always mature differently so it really

1510
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,800
depends on on your variety and that's

1511
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:30,159
why i recommend everybody know your

1512
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,240
variety

1513
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:34,399
to the point where you know what that

1514
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:36,239
biochemical cascade is doing at the time

1515
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,400
that's doing it so you can pull at peak

1516
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:39,919
ripeness and i have to go too far

1517
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,240
um and start to have cannabinoids

1518
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,680
degrade or go too early and have it be

1519
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:44,959
premature where they didn't actually

1520
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:46,719
develop into what they should be

1521
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,639
developed into

1522
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,318
gotcha now do you have any tips for

1523
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:52,558
increasing track home development some

1524
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:55,279
people you know talk about uv adding a

1525
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:57,280
uv i think it's uvb if i'm not mistaken

1526
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,359
towards the end of the light cycle just

1527
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,880
for like an hour or so per day some

1528
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:01,920
people say there are different nutrients

1529
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,800
that you can feed the plant towards the

1530
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,880
end of the light cycle that's going to

1531
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,480
help with the resin production trichome

1532
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,640
production do you have any tips for

1533
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,240
increasing trichome development

1534
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:13,039
well um

1535
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:16,479
yes and that's kind of where i i got

1536
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:18,639
into making my fertilizer line because

1537
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:22,559
carbon-based everything about a trichome

1538
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:25,598
is is carbon-based you know i think

1539
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:28,480
the universities and all these the the

1540
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:30,960
conventional way to grow crops kind of

1541
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,119
miss the ball and one avenue of it where

1542
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,039
they think they say that you need 17

1543
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:38,160
essential elements to grow the plants

1544
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:40,000
right you have carbon hydrogen and

1545
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:42,399
oxygen which are freely supplied that

1546
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,960
you don't have to provide yourself and

1547
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,039
this is where i kind of stray away from

1548
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,519
the collegiate teachings of

1549
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:52,000
agrochemistry and agriculture where you

1550
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:52,719
do need to provide carbon you do need

1551
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,800
and

1552
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:56,879
co2 is a form of carbon that you can

1553
00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:00,400
increase production with you know it

1554
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,400
creates a faster photo

1555
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,720
photosynthesis

1556
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:07,359
it can increase

1557
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:10,000
yields it can increase growth production

1558
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:11,358
that the thing is though

1559
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,480
you need to add

1560
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:15,358
carbon

1561
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,358
in a a form that goes through the root

1562
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:18,960
system and the plants take that and

1563
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:20,880
that's what the plants use to make

1564
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,880
terpenes and flavonoids and cannabinoids

1565
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,400
and in turn that's the material inside

1566
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,079
these resin glands

1567
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,280
you increase more resin gland you

1568
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,680
increase more material inside these

1569
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,559
resin glands you provide more precursors

1570
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:32,639
for

1571
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,880
production of resin glands like resin

1572
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:36,558
glands are silicon based you know if you

1573
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,640
don't have very much silicon in your

1574
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,119
system the plant isn't going to be able

1575
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:43,279
to assimilate that it is not going to

1576
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,480
have materials to assimilate into a

1577
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,440
resin gland

1578
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:51,039
you know so i mean yes you can add the

1579
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:52,480
lighting is is indicative of

1580
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:54,239
of how much

1581
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,719
trichomes are produced and that's

1582
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:58,879
because trichomes are natural protection

1583
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:00,639
protection from uv radiation so if you

1584
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,400
increase radiation

1585
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:04,318
your plants will naturally increase

1586
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,720
tychum production which is the uvbs or

1587
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:08,960
the plasmas at the end of the life cycle

1588
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:11,199
you see cmhs have a higher blue and

1589
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,960
higher blues are tighter wavelengths so

1590
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:15,519
the plant needs to produce more

1591
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,358
trichomes to protect itself

1592
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:19,519
but first and foremost what i would say

1593
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:21,679
is make sure your nutritional regimen is

1594
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:23,599
geared to producing those active

1595
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:25,440
compounds because that's what we're all

1596
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,960
growing this for to have the medicinal

1597
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,079
effects on our body

1598
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,079
again nitrate-based

1599
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:34,159
systems are gonna

1600
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,679
grow more plant matter carbon-based

1601
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:37,679
systems are going to grow

1602
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,679
more cannabinoids more more more

1603
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:41,279
alkaloids within the plant so really

1604
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:43,199
it's making sure that you've got your

1605
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,200
nutritional regimen dialed in and making

1606
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:46,719
sure your lighting is is sufficient to

1607
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:48,399
the needs of the plant to produce the

1608
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:51,118
trichome coverage you're looking for

1609
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,960
okay let's transition over to flushing

1610
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,480
one of the more highly debatable topics

1611
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,159
out there there has actually been

1612
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,159
studies on flushing and when we talk

1613
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:59,519
about flushing where

1614
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:01,598
there's so many definitions now it's

1615
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:03,039
crazy there's flushing as again running

1616
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,640
a large amount of water through the

1617
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:06,239
medium before harvest so you're trying

1618
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:08,400
to reduce the ppm and the medium as much

1619
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:10,479
as possible so that way that the plant

1620
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,880
will start to fade you know the

1621
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,039
chlorophyll will break down and advance

1622
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,280
then there's leaching which is basically

1623
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:18,880
just stopping feeding nutrients for the

1624
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,640
last two weeks and some people call that

1625
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,880
flushing but really the goal for

1626
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:25,199
flushing i think a lot is to see a fade

1627
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,280
or see a senescence in the plant in

1628
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:29,439
order to i mean so many people say

1629
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,720
different reasons for this

1630
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,880
you know some people say that it's going

1631
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,719
to reduce the amount of nutrients in the

1632
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,480
actual plant and it's going to provide a

1633
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:38,078
cleaner ash of smoke i mean i've heard

1634
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,159
so many different things arc screen

1635
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:42,000
technologies had a study on this i'm not

1636
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:43,598
sure if you saw it or not but they came

1637
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,920
to the conclusion that the length of the

1638
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:48,400
flushing period did not impact yield

1639
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,318
potency terpenes or taste

1640
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:53,039
characteristics which tastes just

1641
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:55,599
exactly subjective right right

1642
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:56,798
but the the argument against that is

1643
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,920
that number one there are nutrient

1644
00:56:56,798 --> 00:56:58,639
companies so they're going to tell you

1645
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,920
to

1646
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:01,118
feed nutrients all the way up till the

1647
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,159
end because they make more money that

1648
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,920
way

1649
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:05,598
right so some people say that that's

1650
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,240
biased but the thing that they didn't

1651
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:09,838
measure which is what i'm interested in

1652
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:11,598
is the amount of chlorophyll right we

1653
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:14,719
know chlorophyll breaks down during

1654
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:16,798
drying curing process right but

1655
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:19,279
flushing or not feeding nutrients for

1656
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:20,719
the last couple weeks having that fade

1657
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,079
happen a lot of people say that the

1658
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:23,439
chlorophyll is going to break down

1659
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:26,160
during that period and it's going to

1660
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,119
lead to a faster cure in a sense right

1661
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:28,639
you're not going to taste that

1662
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:30,160
chlorophyll

1663
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:33,118
weeks or

1664
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:35,118
over a month after you know you've dried

1665
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:36,798
and you're in that curing stage

1666
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:39,280
now there haven't been any studies you

1667
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:41,759
need a what's called spectral

1668
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,760
spectrometer spectrometer to measure

1669
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,680
chlorophyll so that hasn't been happened

1670
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,760
right long story short you know what's

1671
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:50,078
your thought process on flushing do you

1672
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,760
think it's beneficial do you think it's

1673
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,720
not beneficial

1674
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,400
so

1675
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,759
you know um

1676
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,720
uh where to start with this there's so

1677
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,760
many different there's so many different

1678
00:57:56,719 --> 00:58:00,719
angles you're right there's so many

1679
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,319
definitions for flushing so okay so i

1680
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:04,399
like to look at this in two different

1681
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:07,838
two different avenues like harvesting

1682
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:09,760
flushing or or oh crap i messed up

1683
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:11,679
flushing right

1684
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,240
so

1685
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:16,879
you look at the the oh crap

1686
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:18,959
situation it's you fed too much you're

1687
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,358
trying to do whatever else is doing

1688
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,358
hitting a 5ec

1689
00:58:21,358 --> 00:58:25,199
peak flower you know you're trying to

1690
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:28,318
crank out the weight in your commercial

1691
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:30,558
facility yada yada yada you get lockout

1692
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:32,880
everything starts tanking downhill

1693
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,640
the plants taking in too many nutrients

1694
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,480
versus water and the plants dehydrating

1695
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:38,239
now now you see nutrient burn across the

1696
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,559
board you see deficiencies left and

1697
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:40,558
right

1698
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:46,400
that flushing i would use some type of

1699
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:48,798
agent to break to break the bonds of all

1700
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:51,760
the salts inside your medium and release

1701
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:54,239
them and flush them out and drain drain

1702
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,839
them from the medium themselves that

1703
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:57,838
flushing is is like a corrective

1704
00:58:55,838 --> 00:58:59,358
flushing you know i i'm all about

1705
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:00,239
corrective flushes

1706
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:02,078
um

1707
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:04,000
synthetic mediums will be easier to

1708
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:05,280
correct to flush than like in organic

1709
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,199
systems because you have the organic

1710
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,079
matter that ties everything up

1711
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:09,279
um

1712
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:12,720
but you know

1713
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:14,400
that i i do agree is is a needed flush

1714
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:16,078
that's really what i consider the

1715
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,960
flushing mechanism

1716
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:20,960
now when you go towards the harvesting

1717
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,400
side of things i like to look at

1718
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,318
harvesting more like a ripening

1719
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,000
perspective than just a get rid of

1720
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:27,599
everything there and let the plant fade

1721
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:32,159
type of thing

1722
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:33,920
naturally inside like organic systems

1723
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:36,719
the plants just naturally you're going

1724
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,920
to deplete the soil essentially the the

1725
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:39,279
reservoir capacity you're going to

1726
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,838
deplete it and the plant's going to take

1727
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:44,240
up less and less nutrition which causes

1728
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:46,960
cannibalism so there's anabolism and

1729
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:48,639
cannibalism animalism of the plant takes

1730
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,720
excess external materials and

1731
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:52,078
synthesizes them into proteins and

1732
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:55,039
synthesizes them into the plant

1733
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,880
nutrition when the plant has a lack of

1734
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:59,838
nutrition coming in a lack of elements

1735
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:01,760
coming in the plant cannibalizes itself

1736
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:03,679
and starts to

1737
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,599
rearrange where the nutrients go to the

1738
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:07,118
most important members of the plant

1739
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:08,400
either the flowers of the fruits because

1740
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,640
that's what you need to preserve in

1741
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:13,599
order to allow the

1742
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:14,960
genetic the genes to continue on

1743
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:15,838
right

1744
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,760
so

1745
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:20,880
what i like to

1746
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:22,480
do is is gradually

1747
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,920
gradually reduce the amount of feed

1748
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,679
towards the end of the life cycle and

1749
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,358
let the plant cannibalize itself because

1750
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:29,199
i believe that's where all the flavors

1751
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:31,598
and that's where all the biological

1752
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:33,358
molecules that end up being all these

1753
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,280
smells and all these flavors and

1754
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:36,400
breaking down the chlorophyll will

1755
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,640
happen

1756
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,880
um and that's that's mostly what what

1757
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:42,639
that's for is is because when the plant

1758
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,358
ripens at the end of its life when

1759
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:48,400
senescence is happening the plant is it

1760
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:51,440
takes the boron creates borosaccharolet

1761
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,480
and boros acrylate or borosacchalos is a

1762
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,559
sugar

1763
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,798
that the plant takes from the leaves and

1764
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:58,720
translocates the flowers and fruits so

1765
01:00:56,798 --> 01:01:00,159
you want that translocation to happen

1766
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:02,000
and this is where like these nitrates

1767
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:03,759
heavy nitrate diets you you really have

1768
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,280
a have a really hard time getting that

1769
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,040
fade without just stripping everything

1770
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,119
out of the medium and letting the plant

1771
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:10,880
have like literally just zero just water

1772
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:14,880
for the last two weeks to cause that

1773
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:16,798
type of translocation sentence to happen

1774
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,880
i like to do that naturally and let the

1775
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:20,000
plant naturally break itself down and

1776
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,318
and and

1777
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,480
with these carbon based ingredients like

1778
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:26,558
i do with my products it allows the

1779
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,639
plants not to be constantly fed nitrates

1780
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,319
to get their elemental uptake they can

1781
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:31,838
get all their elements without having to

1782
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:34,000
excess nitrogen and i believe these

1783
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:36,159
excess nitrates give too much nitrogen

1784
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,480
so it causes an overabundance of

1785
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:40,000
chlorophyll to stay inside

1786
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,440
the the flower and that's why you get

1787
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,599
that hay smell and that's why it's

1788
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,119
harder to get you have to cure longer

1789
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,160
and synthetic systems to get a good

1790
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,400
flavor out of it because you're

1791
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:49,920
constantly perpetuating chlorophyll to

1792
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,680
be produced by constantly feeding it

1793
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,639
nitrates all the way to week seven week

1794
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:56,239
eight so rx solutions you know it was

1795
01:01:54,639 --> 01:01:58,078
correct in their studies where it's like

1796
01:01:56,239 --> 01:01:59,919
yeah it really doesn't

1797
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,519
uh it doesn't affect

1798
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,358
cannabinoid production it doesn't affect

1799
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:05,119
terpene production but what i think it

1800
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:06,239
comes down to exactly what you said it's

1801
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:08,318
like how fast are you allowing

1802
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:09,598
chlorophyll to break down and i think

1803
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:11,279
that that

1804
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:13,039
at the end of whether you flush at the

1805
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,319
end or whether you're allowing the plant

1806
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:16,319
naturally ripened through just a

1807
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:17,599
naturally depleted medium i think that's

1808
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:19,038
where we're all trying to get to is at

1809
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,640
the end in the plant's life you want

1810
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:22,559
that chlorophyll to break down so you

1811
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:24,798
don't want providing it with a bunch of

1812
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,079
nitrogen at the end of its of its life

1813
01:02:24,798 --> 01:02:29,199
cycle because that's what's going to

1814
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:31,760
hold on to the that hay smell and not

1815
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:34,798
allow the proper essence of the flowers

1816
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,319
to come out post harvest well said it's

1817
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:38,159
a tricky topic because like flushing is

1818
01:02:36,318 --> 01:02:40,558
just like this general broad

1819
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:42,719
statement you know yep

1820
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,000
have you heard of vice flushing

1821
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:45,598
yeah

1822
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,960
can we talk about that

1823
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:49,039
absolutely

1824
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,079
bro science 101

1825
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,640
um

1826
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:54,798
i i don't think the temperature of the

1827
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:56,879
rhizosphere has anything to do with the

1828
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:59,358
the senescence or the ripening process

1829
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,280
of the plant the plant isn't like

1830
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:02,960
sitting out in nature and just like oh

1831
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,880
cold water is being sprinkled on me

1832
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:07,679
right now i totally know to start

1833
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:10,880
killing myself and to ripen really quick

1834
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:12,798
you know i think cold water can lock out

1835
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,838
some things so you get better colors

1836
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:16,880
because you have

1837
01:03:14,838 --> 01:03:18,400
a different production you have a

1838
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,480
different amount of elements going into

1839
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,760
the plant you know the plants not able

1840
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,760
to

1841
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,960
properly take up certain things so then

1842
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,880
you have a different biochemical

1843
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:30,079
reaction happening but i don't really

1844
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:32,160
think ice water flushing is as has been

1845
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:33,680
quantified to do anything

1846
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:35,358
other than make you feel good that

1847
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:37,118
you're kind of emulating you're kind of

1848
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:38,239
doing biomimicry and kind of emulating

1849
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,358
nature which if that's what you're

1850
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:41,279
trying to do

1851
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:42,558
by all means dress up as a tree and

1852
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,440
stand next to it you know what i mean

1853
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,039
like

1854
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,480
you know do whatever you feel like make

1855
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,400
sure your heart was great and everything

1856
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,000
but as a scientist quantifiably speaking

1857
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,160
i don't see ice water doing anything

1858
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,280
other than

1859
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:55,038
adjusting the temperature of the root

1860
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,359
zone which shocks the plant you brought

1861
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:59,200
up bringing out the colors as well

1862
01:03:57,358 --> 01:04:00,960
colder temps towards the end of

1863
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:02,480
flowering is another kind of old school

1864
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,000
trick in order to bring out the colors

1865
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,599
what's happening with the plant when you

1866
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,920
kind of lower the temps and colors come

1867
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:09,599
out lack of chlorophyll production is

1868
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,880
what it is plants are green because

1869
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,200
chlorophyll

1870
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,960
you know so it's it

1871
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:16,399
by the weather changing and doing all

1872
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,400
these things is locking out the plant's

1873
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,920
ability to produce green so then you

1874
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,440
start to see the true colors of the

1875
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,960
plant and same with like when the plant

1876
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,960
starts to cannibalize itself and starts

1877
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,798
to break down its own chlorophyll and

1878
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,639
start to do that fade you're seeing the

1879
01:04:26,798 --> 01:04:30,000
actual true colors of the plant plants

1880
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:31,358
well in green because of chlorophyll

1881
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,119
because that's the color it takes to

1882
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:34,480
absorb the sunlight to absorb the

1883
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,318
photons

1884
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,240
you know so i think with cold weather

1885
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:39,838
happening it just changes how the plants

1886
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:41,358
able to produce chlorophyll and the

1887
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:42,639
plant actually knows towards the end of

1888
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:44,558
its life cycle it doesn't need to

1889
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:47,038
produce chlorophyll so when the weather

1890
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:49,440
happens it triggers biochemical process

1891
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:51,520
to allow the plants anthocyanins or all

1892
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,838
these different colors to come out

1893
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:56,318
interesting

1894
01:04:52,838 --> 01:04:57,920
okay how about stem splitting

1895
01:04:56,318 --> 01:05:00,079
you ever heard of stem splitting those

1896
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:02,000
uh in favor of the technique argue that

1897
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:04,079
it stresses the plant beneficial way

1898
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,239
forcing it to uptake more nutrients and

1899
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:09,519
produce bigger more potent buds what's

1900
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:10,879
your thoughts on stem splitting uh

1901
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:12,880
anytime

1902
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,760
people are trying to do one little trick

1903
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,440
to get

1904
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,559
bigger

1905
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,519
and

1906
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:19,519
uh

1907
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:20,480
more resin-coated buds i always kind of

1908
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:22,960
like

1909
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,079
my head to it because it's not one

1910
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,480
way that it's just going to make your

1911
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:28,240
buds be big you know and stem splitting

1912
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,240
does stress and

1913
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:31,358
the same thing it's like low stress and

1914
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:32,558
those you have low stress and high

1915
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:34,400
stress training

1916
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:36,720
you know it it

1917
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,000
can cause the plant to be a little more

1918
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:39,759
vigorous because it has to fight through

1919
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,358
the stress then once it heals the wound

1920
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,160
the plants already has that much energy

1921
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:46,639
going to it i don't necessarily enjoy

1922
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:48,719
stressing my plant out more than i need

1923
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:51,038
to and creating open wounds

1924
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:53,038
i feel like it takes away energy from

1925
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,480
other parts of the plant

1926
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,280
um

1927
01:05:54,480 --> 01:06:00,318
stem splitting again i haven't seen any

1928
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:02,798
data showing that it increases yields or

1929
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:05,038
increases i mean i can see that it might

1930
01:06:02,798 --> 01:06:07,038
increase cannabinoid production only

1931
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:08,559
because you stress the plant and the

1932
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:10,079
plant produces metabolites when you

1933
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:12,319
stress it

1934
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:14,880
so i maybe see that but as far as like

1935
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:16,079
vigor and growth that i prefer

1936
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,519
if i could have a plant where i didn't

1937
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,599
even have to top it and it could just

1938
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:22,639
grow laterally and just like be a huge

1939
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:24,160
bush i'll just do that and and

1940
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:25,440
feed the crap out of it you know and

1941
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:27,199
just

1942
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,039
maintain a good

1943
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:30,480
harmonic system within the root zone

1944
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:32,400
into the plant make sure the ph is

1945
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,240
stable make sure the ppm is right on

1946
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,838
point where i needed to be and just

1947
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:37,519
hit it with as many growth promoters and

1948
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:39,679
microbes as i can

1949
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:42,318
you know so i'd like that

1950
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:44,318
i say stem swimming more um more of a

1951
01:06:42,318 --> 01:06:46,960
bro science

1952
01:06:44,318 --> 01:06:48,960
gotcha then i do actual any technical

1953
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,159
and it's not really commercially viable

1954
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,599
i mean if you look at it like if you

1955
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:52,960
have a couple plants you can definitely

1956
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:56,480
do that and you can baby them but if you

1957
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,920
have 100 300 500 000 plants you're not

1958
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,280
there's no way

1959
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,639
you know you're gonna cause way more

1960
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,079
problems and you're gonna get gain out

1961
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:04,078
of it

1962
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:07,039
gotcha okay

1963
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:10,079
bud washing let's talk about that one

1964
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:11,839
so washing your buds after harvesting i

1965
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:14,160
love these questions

1966
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:15,759
i saved the best questions for you yeah

1967
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:17,279
yeah i love it thank you this is so bud

1968
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,200
washing just a quick explanation of what

1969
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,880
it is you know some people they'll dip

1970
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:22,318
it in they'll have a couple different

1971
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,318
buckets so they'll harvest their plant

1972
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:26,639
and then they'll dip it first in

1973
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:28,318
baking soda and lemon juice and then

1974
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:29,759
they'll go into water and then they'll

1975
01:07:28,318 --> 01:07:32,318
have another one that's water so they're

1976
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,920
washing off their buds any debris that's

1977
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:36,400
on there supposedly there's a chemical

1978
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,159
reaction happening with the baking soda

1979
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,838
and lemon juice that's allowing some of

1980
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:41,118
the debris to be broken down what are

1981
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:42,719
your thoughts on blood washing what do

1982
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:45,920
you know about blood washing

1983
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:47,358
you know i have always been against it i

1984
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,280
like the

1985
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:51,038
the completely natural approach even

1986
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,839
outdoor fly my favorite flower i've ever

1987
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:56,960
grown and smoked has been outdoor

1988
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:58,239
outdoor cali plants you know

1989
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,920
um

1990
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:02,719
but and that's no washing or anything

1991
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,480
but i have seen um

1992
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:07,759
there's a guy on instagram named heavy

1993
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:09,519
icer his name's aaron um really has to

1994
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,200
look out for his health

1995
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:13,038
which i mean all of us do but he

1996
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:15,199
especially and he's been really really

1997
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:17,279
good at hands-on tutorial with like

1998
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:19,920
blood washing and

1999
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:22,960
making his own solvent list and whatnot

2000
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:24,798
um and i he really gave me a change of

2001
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:28,000
of perspective where

2002
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:31,278
he had his three vats you know he dipped

2003
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,039
dipped dipped and then um at the end of

2004
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,239
it he had you know his plant outdoor

2005
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:35,439
plants so he had

2006
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:38,559
nice

2007
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:40,318
couple pound plants it

2008
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,640
did a

2009
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:45,679
a bubble bag collection at the end of it

2010
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:47,119
through like a 20 15 or 25 micron and

2011
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:48,480
because everybody says like you dip and

2012
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:50,000
it's going to take away all of your

2013
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:52,639
trichomes and you know you're going to

2014
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,838
lose all the material you grew doing

2015
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,880
that and

2016
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:58,479
he had

2017
01:08:54,880 --> 01:09:00,480
barely anything in that 25 micron screen

2018
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:03,039
and he washed all he took all did like

2019
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:04,879
50 it's like probably took 90 gallons of

2020
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:06,399
water that he used to wash all those

2021
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,159
plants with and did a collection at the

2022
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:09,198
end of it and there's only like gunk

2023
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:11,599
there's only stuff in there that you

2024
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:13,599
probably don't wanna don't wanna consume

2025
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:16,319
so after seeing that i was like

2026
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:19,039
i actually understand this methodology

2027
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:20,960
now because like yeah it's dirty outside

2028
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:22,719
and there's with all the smoke and all

2029
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,920
the ash

2030
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:26,960
bugs

2031
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:28,798
bird doo doo you know what i mean like

2032
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:31,520
there's there's a bunch of excrements

2033
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:32,798
from all these natural insects natural

2034
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,199
animals out there that you probably

2035
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:36,880
don't want to be consuming

2036
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:39,919
so um

2037
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:42,000
i actually now i think if it's as a

2038
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,239
legitimate um

2039
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,279
answer to dirty flower

2040
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:46,879
mind you it's not going to get rid of

2041
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:48,080
your pm it's not going to get rid of

2042
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,520
grave it's not going to get really

2043
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:50,479
spiderman so i mean you'll wash them off

2044
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,000
but like

2045
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:54,000
you should handle that before you can

2046
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,719
get into flour or when you get in the

2047
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,399
beginning of flour to make sure the last

2048
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:00,640
four to seven weeks you don't get

2049
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:02,079
anything on your plants but if you're

2050
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,800
really concerned about your health and

2051
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:07,039
you do need to you do want clean flour

2052
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,800
then yeah absolutely wash it now i don't

2053
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:10,319
know about residuals i haven't done any

2054
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,000
residual analysis and that's the one

2055
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:14,639
thing that i would be

2056
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,399
concerned about because sit like lemon

2057
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,960
juice is citric acid

2058
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:21,920
sodium bicarbonate is

2059
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:23,359
uh baking soda so i don't i don't know

2060
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,679
about the residuals that would be my

2061
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:27,119
question and what i would go to like

2062
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:29,679
next in my

2063
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:32,479
hierarchy of how i kind of discover

2064
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:34,319
these things my discovery process

2065
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:35,678
i'd see about the residuals after i go

2066
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:37,599
okay that's a good process to make sure

2067
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:38,960
my flower is clean now what are the

2068
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,719
residuals on it because i still don't

2069
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:44,079
have any data on if there is any

2070
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:46,800
residual on it i personally have never

2071
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:48,640
consumed materials that have been washed

2072
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,760
so i mean i can't really say for sure if

2073
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,560
it's like

2074
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:55,280
qualitatively good or bad

2075
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,480
but you know i can i can i guess i can i

2076
01:10:55,279 --> 01:10:59,039
guess what i'm trying to say is i can

2077
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:01,359
see it as a method to clean flowers if

2078
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:02,960
you know it's outdoor or you have dirty

2079
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:05,198
flower

2080
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:08,319
like actual dirt dirt dirty not like

2081
01:11:05,198 --> 01:11:10,319
dirty as in like oh it has

2082
01:11:08,319 --> 01:11:12,960
but loads of pm on it how do i remediate

2083
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:14,319
this now you know gotcha that makes

2084
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,079
sense

2085
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:18,880
all right let's wrap things up

2086
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:20,880
we went over a lot in this one

2087
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,079

01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:39,279
line so we're trying to get into all the

2125
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:41,199
stores and get samples out we're doing a

2126
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:42,639
bunch of samples campaign we

2127
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:44,479
launched samples about a month ago and

2128
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,480
we already have close to 300 sample kits

2129
01:12:44,479 --> 01:12:48,319
being sent out

2130
01:12:46,479 --> 01:12:49,519
not on top of the sample kits we're

2131
01:12:48,319 --> 01:12:51,039
sending out the store so things are

2132
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,040
going gangbusters right now for the

2133
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:55,198
theon fertilizers so whether you're in

2134
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:58,000
hydroponics soil whether you're doing

2135
01:12:55,198 --> 01:12:59,919
some type of medium between the two um

2136
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,600
check out eon it's it's you know our

2137
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:03,119
organic fertilizer system that's able to

2138
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:06,079
be used in hydroponics all the way to

2139
01:13:03,119 --> 01:13:07,760
soil essentially i like to grow good

2140
01:13:06,079 --> 01:13:09,359
medicine i want everybody to grow good

2141
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:11,679
medicine so what's what we're really

2142
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:13,039
trying to do is is pump this really hard

2143
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,480
and get this in as many people's hands

2144
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:16,880
as possible because i really do feel

2145
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:19,198
like this is the next evolution

2146
