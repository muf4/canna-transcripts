00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:34,019
in a future video okay I have rambled on

16
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,119
enough let's get into the questions

17
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,359
are you still growing freak Show I

18
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:42,238
harvested that so I got two cuts from

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,340
Humboldt Seed Co they were at MJ bizcon

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,439
and I was just crazy to think that it

21
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,460
was over a year now uh so I actually got

22
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:52,619
that Harvest both those plants and um I

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,020
didn't continue I didn't clone it and

24
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,599
not continuing on with it I liked the

25
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,460
terpene profile wasn't crazy about like

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,500
the bud structure and the way it grew

27
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,579
and so on and so forth so it's not

28
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,799
something I'm going to keep in my garden

29
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,500
but I actually still do have some of the

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,240
Harvest and uh good smoke definitely

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,659
good smoke do you have any experience

32
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,459
with blue mats yes I do I have a 12 pack

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,560
of blue mats that I've been using for

34
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:18,839
several years now I really like the blue

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,579
mats using them off and on you know no

36
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,280
good reason for why I've been using them

37
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:25,978
off and on hand watering is is fun

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,780
sometimes but the blue mats are so

39
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:29,340
awesome because they're so hands off I

40
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,379
have it hooked up to a 14 gallon

41
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,478
Reservoir that's sufficient for me

42
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:35,759
because normally I'm growing between

43
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,759
like six and of plants so 14 gallon

44
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,739
Reservoir top it off every three to five

45
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,140
days so it's not too much maintenance on

46
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:44,819
my side but I love the blue mats takes a

47
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,920
little bit to dial them in to begin but

48
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:48,719
once you put them down into the medium

49
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,640
you know the medium should be the proper

50
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,140
moisture level then stick them down in

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,159
there then of course just follow the

52
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,259
instructions they have really good

53
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,640
instructions on how you set them up and

54
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,439
they've worked out great for me

55
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,420
particularly when top dressing with

56
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,639
Organic amendments and one little tip

57
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,200
I'll mention that I've been trying has

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,700
been working out pretty good is a lot of

59
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,960
people will Top dress the organic

60
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,060
amendments and they'll top trash across

61
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,618
the entire medium right well these blue

62
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,539
mats particularly with the dripper I'm

63
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:14,280
using just the one dripper down some

64
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,019
people actually have a hose that kind of

65
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,699
wraps around I haven't done that yet I

66
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,260
want to do that but I've been basically

67
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:20,878
trying to get the amendments to be right

68
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:22,199
underneath where the blue mat has been

69
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:23,639
dripping and that seems to have been

70
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:25,019
working out pretty good because when I

71
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:27,119
have amendments on the other side of

72
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,920
where the dripper is the medium doesn't

73
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,620
stay moist on that side so that's kind

74
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,238
of the only downside of blue mats I know

75
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,280
some people have had issues with blue

76
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,500
mats particularly them they're not being

77
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,539
set up correctly or failing on them and

78
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,098
then flooding their grow tents and stuff

79
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:42,840
I've been fortunate enough to not have

80
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:45,238
that issue but I really do like blue

81
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,939
mats highly recommend blue mats next

82
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,878
question what complete grow tank kits do

83
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:53,759

autopods we're talking about blue mats

91

earlier and a lot of them come with the

mention that the kits include my book

98
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:24,120
actually included in their kit which I

99
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:25,979
thought was pretty cool so it's a

100
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,200
collaboration I've had with happy Hydro

101
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:31,139

105
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:39,598
to happy Hydro are you using regular

106
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,399
water and humidifier so I actually have

107
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,560
tried using tap water in a humidifier

108
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,539
way back in the day and it turned out to

109
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,280
be a failure the reason why is because I

110
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:48,719
have so many minerals in my tap what I

111
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,580
have hard water and the minerals on the

112
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,098
tap water what happens is they'll be

113
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,019
like a white fuzz that kind of comes out

114
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:56,878
from the humidifier and gets all over

115
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,039
your plants inside of the grow tent and

116
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,139
believe it or not clogs up the carbon

117
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,378
filter restricts airflow particularly

118
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:06,598
that carbon filter sock and um has been

119
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:09,120
no good so ever since then I've been

120
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:11,579
using RO water for many many years now

121
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,500
some people use distilled water but pure

122
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,620
water without minerals in there do you

123
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,139
still have a worm bin yes I do so I've

124
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,180
had a worm bin for a little over a year

125
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,939
and a half now actually created a worm

126
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,879
bin for composting added in a brick of

127
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:28,259
cocoa some paper shreddings now I'm

128
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,959
adding in the usual you know coffee

129
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:33,360
grounds any greens that are left over

130
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,799
banana peels those are mostly what I'm

131
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,120
putting in there so some eggshells

132
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,079
although the eggshells I made the

133
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,040
mistake of not grinding them up so

134
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,079
eggshells you know you should be

135
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,340
grinding them up completely into a

136
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,899
powder and then and then kind of putting

137
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:47,219
it in there at least that's what I

138
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:48,659
believe you should be doing because when

139
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,220
I just crumple them up my hands and put

140
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,680
them in there I mean they're still still

141
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,060
breaking down now so uh don't do that

142
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,439
mistake

143
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,819
but yeah I still have it it's alive and

144
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,620
kicking I have some red wigglers in

145
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:00,418
there I had some European night crawlers

146
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,399
in there as well so just trying to get

147
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:04,198
some diversity in the worm bin another

148
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,459
question here does Mr Canucks do

149
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,520
interview would you try to get him on

150
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:10,799
your show he's been invited to both my

151
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,599
show as well as FTS the response I got

152
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,060
from him is he doesn't go on shows he

153
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,259
doesn't go on shows or podcasts so uh

154
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,060
but he mentioned that hey if that

155
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:20,400
changes he'll hit me up so fingers

156
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,839
crossed everyone regarding blue mat how

157
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,060
would you go about feeding Advanced

158
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,219
Nutrients just water in or run through

159
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,560
the blue mat Reservoir so what I would

160
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,840
do is I would use use it in the

161
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,538
reservoir you can do your weekly mixture

162
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,939
according to their feeding chart they

163
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:37,379
have it broken down between weeks right

164
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:38,759
so that's kind of what you're aiming for

165
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:41,579
to put in the reservoir now a lot of

166
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:43,259
people go with a half dose or even a

167
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:44,939
quarter dose of what it's recommended on

168
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,800
the feeding chart to begin to make sure

169
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:48,538
they're not there's no toxicity is Just

170
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,978
Happening especially with the auto

171
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:52,439
watering system when you have something

172
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:53,758
dripping down like that at all times so

173
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,199
probably want to start with a half dose

174
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,819
or something in a quarter dose but yeah

175
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,520
mix it right up on your Reservoir pH

176
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:00,959
adjust and then check on it each day you

177
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,459
know you might need to fill it up

178
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,560
depending on how much the reservoir has

179
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:07,138
dropped down you can also add in water

180
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,939
if you make your mixture too strong you

181
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:10,319
check that you see on it or PPM and

182
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:12,000
you're like oh this is too strong this

183
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,918
isn't going to be this might lead to a

184
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,839
toxicity issue in my plant because maybe

185
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,120
it's a smaller plant for example add in

186
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,679
water and dilute it down a little bit a

187
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,759
little tip there but yeah I'd mix it

188
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,139
right in the reservoir and have it

189
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,699
dripping down I wouldn't I wouldn't go

190
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:26,340
about like cutting off the reservoir at

191
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,800
all or and hand watering nutrients like

192
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:31,799
that what is the surfactant you use for

193
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,038
IPM again so I just use Dr Bronner's

194
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,960
Soap just a little teaspoon of it within

195
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,699
water some people do a teaspoon within

196
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,099
48 ounces of water some people do a

197
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:43,800
teaspoon within a gallon of water and

198
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,500
then adding in some essential oil drops

199
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,720
is what I've done in the past don't do

200
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,300
it as often now since I I use the

201
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,340
mammoth can control but I was using

202
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,560
Rosemary putting a bunch of drops in

203
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:57,538
there peppermint met was another one and

204
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,879
then neem oil I was using that as well

205
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:02,339
but yeah Dr Bronner's Soap very common

206
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,199
thing used for or surfactant or some

207
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,698
people would just use Dawn dish soap but

208
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,860
I know there's some controversy on

209
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,379
whether or not chemicals are involved

210
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,680
there so in Organics have you had the

211
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:16,978
top soil turn hard cement-like is this

212
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,500
from drying out too often good question

213
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:21,300
so I'm assuming you're talking about the

214
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,220
Amendments kind of the organic

215
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,900
amendments mixed into that top part of

216
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,060
the soil and then when it's drying out

217
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:30,299
it's hardening up yeah I've come across

218
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,098
that before absolutely and so since then

219
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,199
I've been adding in most layers I've

220
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:36,060
been adding in cover crops I've been

221
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,680
adding in soil on top of those

222
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,180
amendments and only try to avoid that

223
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,560
from happening and that's been working

224
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,900
out pretty good but yeah it's really

225
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,699
hard to sometimes mix in those

226
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:47,159
amendments and when you water it in

227
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,419
making sure that that top layer stays

228
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,340
moist it's always been a challenge for

229
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:52,079
me at least so adding an Emulsion layer

230
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:53,579
on top of it is going to help prevent

231
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,139
that from occurring but yeah good

232
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:58,439
question that has happened to me before

233
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:02,699
do you ever see yourself growing in a

234
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:05,160
living soil bed yes I do I actually have

235
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,020
a two foot by four foot actually I

236
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,539
already am growing in a living soil bed

237
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,459
but it's outdoors vegetables I have a

238
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:13,318
two foot by 10 foot bed by Grassroots

239
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:15,478
fabric pots big shout out to them they

240
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:19,080
make some really good living soil beds

241
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:21,959
yeah lettuce kale bok choy I had some

242
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,719
carrots in there spinach love the living

243
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:27,779
soil bed as far as for medicinal

244
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,580
varieties when indoor I have a two foot

245
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:32,338
by four foot bed but I never actually

246
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:34,679
set it up I have some concerns because I

247
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,719
could be moving maybe this year but I

248
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:39,418
hate to fill up a two foot by four foot

249
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,860
bed and then have to move it you know so

250
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,838
I think that's the only thing holding me

251
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,120
back from from setting up a bed indoors

252
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,459
have you considered putting fruit in the

253
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,860
medium to decompose would that help with

254
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:52,979
the microbes so generally you want to

255
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,379
put fruit or veggies or stuff like that

256
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,600
in compost first and let the microbe

257
00:08:55,379 --> 00:09:00,059
cycle that and turn that into a compost

258
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,639
before adding it into your medium now

259
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:04,859
the temperature will kind of Rise when

260
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,139
things are being composted so generally

261
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,300
people aren't putting things like that

262
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:10,980
like fruits or leafy greens or anything

263
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:13,079
like that directly into the medium and

264
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,519
burying it down if they are they don't

265
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,080
have generally don't have plants in

266
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,759
there I'm not saying nobody's ever done

267
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,500
it and nobody's ever been successful

268
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,899
doing that but that's just kind of the

269
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,958
General Route that people go I've mixed

270
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,759
up plant material in bucket of soil

271
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,739
before and just let that sit for several

272
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:31,200
weeks and then planted a plant into it

273
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,299
and been fine but now never put fruit

274
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,860
directly into the medium have you ever

275
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:36,539
done that I've never really even heard

276
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,879
of anybody doing that to be honest would

277
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:40,439
you ever do a freak chill run again

278
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,059
um probably no I was talking about that

279
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,100
a little while ago I don't know if

280
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:46,319
you're here for that or not but I had a

281
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,659
successful Harvest still have some right

282
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,480
now but I did not keep it in my garden

283
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:53,278
so I'm not crazy it was pretty kind of

284
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,200
finicky grower in my opinion any

285
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,539
thoughts on throwing in a handful of

286
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,300
worms in each pot to assist in

287
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:03,179
decomposition and adding fresh castings

288
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:05,458
to the mix great idea I've done it I had

289
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:06,838
them in seven gallon containers I

290
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:10,379
probably wouldn't go with any smaller

291
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:12,600
containers I would use worms if using

292
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:14,759
synthetic nutrients but Organics

293
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,399
absolutely I'm actually shifting up to a

294
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,958
10 gallon Grill pot for organic so I'm

295
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,339
actually emptying out the soil from my

296
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,500
seven gallon containers I've been

297
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,360
reusing for several years now and then

298
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,519
putting them into 10 gallons I just feel

299
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,080
like with the bigger containers better

300
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,459
for for numerous reasons but

301
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,720
particularly with the worms which is

302
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,099
what you're asking about just kind of

303
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,620
gives them a little room so definitely

304
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,778
recommend red wigglers some people use

305
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,759
European night crawlers I have those as

306
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:40,620
well and African nightcrawls are the

307
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,299
three worms that you can kind of check

308
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,120
out and I've just purchased from Uncle

309
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:46,979
Jim's worm farm so online Source just

310
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,620
Google it I know a lot of people will

311
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,060
grab stuff locally as well I went to

312
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,620
Walmart one time in the bait section

313
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:55,500
they have worms they have like red

314
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,000
wigglers there and they looked awful so

315
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,860
I never ended up getting it but some

316
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,659
people will go to their local Walmart or

317
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,860
bait store and get worms there because

318
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:03,120
you get them pretty decently cheap

319
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,039
probably get them a lot cheaper than

320
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,659
Uncle Jim's worm farm another blew my

321
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,419
question lots of blue mat questions this

322
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:11,819
episode huh wow it's a good system it is

323
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:14,039
I travel for work non-stop can I use

324
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,680
blue mat in my one gallon than

325
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:19,078
transplant my carrot and plant into my

326
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:20,759
seven gallon absolutely yeah yeah you

327
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,379
can simply take that carrot lift it up

328
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:23,879
from that one gallon and put it into

329
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:25,559
that seven gallon you'll have to adjust

330
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:26,820
the dialing stuff to Redial it in

331
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,559
because it's it's going to be a

332
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,240
different moisture level and just I

333
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,859
found that dialing redialing it

334
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,899
recalibrating it whatever you want to

335
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,579
call it in that new container you'll

336
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,320
find yourself having to do that but like

337
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:38,939
always yeah just make sure that that new

338
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,040
container that you're putting it in is

339
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,260
of the proper moisture is of the ideal

340
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,819
moisture level that way when you hop in

341
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:47,458
the when you pop in that blue Mac carrot

342
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,140
dial it in it should stay at that ideal

343
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:51,119
moisture level but yeah you can take it

344
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:52,919
from one one to another and switch it

345
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,419
over real quick no problem what's been

346
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:56,699
the most challenging thing about growing

347
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:59,399
besides your humidity that's a good

348
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,019
question there's lots of challenges out

349
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,360
there isn't there so humidity has

350
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:05,100
certainly been a challenge as I assume

351
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,860
you watch my videos you know that I have

352
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,600
very low humidity right now 21 is what

353
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,579
I'm seeing right here in this room and

354
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,200
so it's super tough in my grow room to

355
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:15,599
keep the humidity up I have humidifiers

356
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,720
in there 24 hours three of them actually

357
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,759
and that grow Roman into grow tents and

358
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,379
um yeah other challenges heat can

359
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,120
certainly be a challenge particularly in

360
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:25,559
the summertime this is something I talk

361
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,019
about pretty recently on on the podcast

362
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,939
I released and basically during the

363
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,399
daytime when the temperature reaches up

364
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,899
to 100 degrees 110 degrees outside it's

365
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,700
tough to keep the temperature down

366
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,259
indoors especially when I have a grow

367
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,720
light on you know it's generating heat

368
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:42,600
so I try to just stick with you know 12

369
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,639
12 photos during the summer time keep my

370
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,899
lights off during the day other

371
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,278
challenges I mean I think everybody

372
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,139
comes across the challenge of just

373
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,000
keeping the plant healthy you know the

374
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:52,680
nutrition you know whether it be growing

375
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,720
in soil and having the right nutrients

376
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:56,759
in there right balance of nutrients

377
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,700
there's been so many times I've had

378
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:02,100
grower error over feeding under feeding

379
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,720
I definitely think it's a challenge to

380
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,278
dial in feeding you know it definitely

381
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,620
takes a little while certainly top

382
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,240
dressing Organics organic Blends in

383
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,159
particular can make things a lot easier

384
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,560
then you're just focusing on keeping the

385
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:15,120
medium moist and not so mixing up

386
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,000
nutrients on a weekly basis in a

387
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,159
reservoir pH adjusting and then soil

388
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,078
Genting your plants so thanks for tuning
