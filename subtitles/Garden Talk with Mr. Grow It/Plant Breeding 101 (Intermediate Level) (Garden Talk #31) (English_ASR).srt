1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,359
coming up on garden talk a hollow stem

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,240
compared to a solid stem will relate to

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,559
typically higher production in trichomes

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,719
we can stress a female out and make her

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,718
create manners then that means the

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,399
hermaphroditic trait is dominant her

7
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:18,320
pain profiles from that stem rub i

8
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,399
always stress that it's so important one

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,719
particular alleles are one particular

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,559
version per gene that is homozygous

11
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,679
status that's what we want to achieve

12
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:30,399
when you see f2 f2 f2 that's when we've

13
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,960
opened up to the most choices of

14
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,119
phenotypes and our characteristics and

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,640
our elios is what we call them that's

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,959
when we start our selective breeding

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,640
process don't get discouraged

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,399
understanding is going to take your time

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,320

pleasure yeah glad to have you on we're

102
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:49,199
going to talk about breeding today so i

103
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:51,919
actually did a video with vader og

104
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,878
from ocean grove genetics a while back

105
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,839
we did a beginner video on breeding and

106
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:57,840
this one i feel like we're going to get

107
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,519
more into more intermediate things now

108
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,200
some of these questions some of the

109
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,120
viewers might ask and they might say

110
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,359
you've already talked about this on the

111
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,840
last video but a lot of things with

112
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,360
breeding i feel like are subjective

113
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,598
right like when we start talking about

114
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,599
traits and stuff that breeders look for

115
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,438
so we're going to get into all of that

116
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,680
that's why some of those questions are

117
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,159
asked on both that video as well as this

118
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,800
video or a podcast episode i should say

119
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,240
and then i did actually have people

120
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,120
submitting questions through instagram

121
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,319
so if you're not following me on

122
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,560
instagram

123
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,879
mr.growit follow me on there and you get

124
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,800
a chance to ask questions in the future

125
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,040
to future guests so before we actually

126
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,240
get into the nitty-gritty of plant

127
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,439
breeding can you tell us a little bit

128
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,720
about yourself and how you got into

129
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,120
gardening

130
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,639
yeah yes my name is salam originally

131
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,720
from new jersey

132
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,079
born and raised so um

133
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,240
my initial passion for gardening um

134
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,319
started ironically sounds weird but it

135
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,360
started with dogs

136
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,639
we learned a family tree of dogs and

137
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,040
that kind of

138
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,720
ended up learning through research that

139
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,120
it was well connected with plants as

140
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,199
well in gardening

141
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,360
my gardening experience started about

142
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,639
five years ago outdoors

143
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,240
vegetables

144
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,120
uh

145
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,680
kale

146
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,560
collard greens all the good stuff um

147
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,319
especially um it kicked up really

148
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,759
uh in the last couple years with the

149
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,918
whole virus thing and everything

150
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,400
everybody wanted to kick up their immune

151
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:27,680
system and you know so we get into all

152
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,679
the natural plants and medicines and um

153
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,680
that's that's kind of where my my garden

154
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,840
started about five years ago outside

155
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,280
actually with the vegetables

156
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,198
nice and i know before we started

157
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,519
recording you had talked about how you

158
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,919
started with dog breeding 15 years ago

159
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,680
and how a lot of that knowledge actually

160
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,519
transfers over to plants which i thought

161
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,519
was pretty interesting and we're going

162
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,038
to get deeper into it i got to ask in

163
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,000
your opinion what

164
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,519
makes a reputable breeder you know why

165
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,879
are you a reputable reader i thought

166
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,639
that was a good question from somebody

167
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,800
through instagram that asked that

168
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,639
definitely um that's important too

169
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,280
that's a really good question

170
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,639
as far as me transparency um

171
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,879
transparency

172
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,240
and education like that's that's the

173
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,800
most important thing being able to

174
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,519
educate not only your friends and and

175
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,720
your fellow bromies or gardeners but

176
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,399
also

177
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,720
you know if you have followers if you

178
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,120
have customers whatever your niche is

179
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,759
whatever you have uh educate each one

180
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,560
teach one um and and i think that's what

181
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,439
makes uh a reputable breeder being open

182
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,439
with everybody you deal with gotcha

183
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,120
now there was somebody who asked a

184
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,478
question through instagram he's got a

185
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,079
very small space

186
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,279
and he wants to know how much space do

187
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,120
you need to

188
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,559
micro breed i guess you can call it

189
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,759
right what's it like the smallest space

190
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,839
that you can actually breed in

191
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,479
that's that's a new term but um

192
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,918
it's new to me but um it doesn't take

193
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,918
much space at all that's the good thing

194
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,719
about breeding um you know when you

195
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,359
think

196
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,639
uh in terms of gardening you tend to

197
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,080
need a lot of space as far as generally

198
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,079
creating

199
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,159
vegetables and flowers you know you tend

200
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,758
to need more space but when it comes to

201
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,960
making seeds you don't need as much

202
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,120
space typically ideally uh two by four

203
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,758
tent uh if you cook two tenths would

204
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,160
even be better um you know but that's

205
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,560
pretty much all you would need what's

206
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,840
your setup look like

207
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,038
um i run a 2x2 i'm sorry 2x4 i'll also

208
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,478
run a

209
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,199
4x4

210
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:32,240
um i did have a 2x2 up but i took it

211
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,400
down uh my my uh mother i have a mother

212
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,319
uh mac one which uh

213
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,478
typically got way too big she's about

214
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,960
eight feet tall she got way too big for

215
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:43,439
her two by two so that we

216
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,439
don't use anymore gotcha so as a home

217
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,959
grower you can definitely do breeding

218
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,719
you know just a couple tents you can

219
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,839
definitely get away with it so that's

220
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,599
cool

221
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,918
now let's talk about selection process

222
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,159
so this is where it's kind of like

223
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,639
it's gets into subjective right it comes

224
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,479
down to breeders preference okay so

225
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,840
starting with male plants how do you

226
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,839
select your male plants for breeding

227
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,239
so male plants is a tricky one too

228
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,598
because typically you'll never

229
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,400
really know it's really hard to

230
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,439
determine what treats a male is going to

231
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:18,478
pass off to a female offspring you know

232
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:21,120
it's kind of like similar to like um

233
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:23,120
you know if a dad the dad is it's going

234
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,918
to be hard to look at look at it dad and

235
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,759
say

236
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:31,519
i wonder what his daughter's bra size

237
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,120
may be once she is born

238
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,679
you know

239
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,158
well it's really similar to that and um

240
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,958
we we have ways and tricks that we

241
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,799
um that we can kind of

242
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:46,000
you know use our best

243
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:49,838
uh kind of give us the best idea of what

244
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,320
would be a good true male breeder and um

245
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,240
stem rub stimulation of the you know

246
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,560
getting kind of getting the idea what

247
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,399
those terpenes strong terpene profiles

248
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,679
and that typically will relate to good

249
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,399
flavors and

250
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,319
strong plants ultimately medicine and as

251
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,879
well um

252
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,959
hollow stem a hollow stem usually

253
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,679
compared to a solid stem

254
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:14,319
will relate to typically higher uh

255
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,519
content as far as production in tribe

256
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,040
homes

257
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,679
if that's something that you're

258
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,679
interested in

259
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,039
and probably the

260
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,159
biggest one structure as well structure

261
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,039
and bigger

262
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:32,079
vigor is um probably the biggest one um

263
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,439
a vigorous growing uh vigorous ground

264
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,200
plant is going to be

265
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,200
one that you want to

266
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,240
use using your

267
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,320
you know your

268
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,879
it's just your lawn

269
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,959
gotcha now i know some burritos they'll

270
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,919
stress their plants you know whether

271
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:50,079
they do training or some folks will let

272
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,919
their plants grow naturally do you let

273
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,759
your plants kind of grow naturally

274
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,120
christmas tree style or are you like

275
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,958
training your plants and kind of

276
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,639
stressing them out in certain ways to

277
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,879
kind of help determine whether or not

278
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,958
that's a selectable plant

279
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:05,759
absolutely stress testing is very

280
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,439
important as well um at different stages

281
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,600
you definitely want to stress test the

282
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,959
mail for the selection process and

283
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,320
that's probably the only reason i would

284
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:17,119
ever train a potential

285
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,680
male for you know breeding would be to

286
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,679
uh you know stress test

287
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,199
um training uh

288
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,759
defoliating

289
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,720
uh bending twisting turn and all that

290
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,799
good stuff um that's pretty much you

291
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,040
would only do it for that reason not

292
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:36,319
necessarily for flower production now

293
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,319
what about like feeding i guess kind of

294
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,120
in relation to stress testing in a sense

295
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,278
to

296
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,200
you kind of give them like a lack of

297
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,360
nutrients i think some breeders do that

298
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,800
they'll run low on the nutrients or

299
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,879
they'll try to go heavy on the nutrients

300
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,319
to kind of stress and see how the plant

301
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:51,838
evolves and then kind of make their

302
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,600
decision off of that do you do any of

303
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,720
that or

304
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,440
well spiking nitrogen is typically good

305
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,600
a really high spike in nitrogen kind of

306
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,360
give it a little overdose of nitrogen

307
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,879
will uh be a good

308
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,120
you know stressor

309
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:09,200
um i don't necessarily me personally i

310
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,440
don't uh under feed

311
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,800
this um i think it'll take too long to

312
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,519
kind of get the results that i'm looking

313
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,759
for

314
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,440
as to where a spike in nitrogen is going

315
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,679
to give you that instant

316
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,399
kind of indication of this plant and

317
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,078
whether it can you know how hearty it is

318
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,839
okay that makes sense

319
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,278
so the plant's been growing male plant

320
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,800
you have identified meal plane you

321
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,240
flipped it over to the light cycle for

322
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,240
example and now it starts producing

323
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,759
pollen sacs pollen sacs produce you know

324
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,320
first time i ever grew a milk plant

325
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,039
seeing the pollen sacs within a couple

326
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,560
weeks and like opening within i think

327
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,159
within three weeks like i thought it was

328
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,919
just super quick you know and i wasn't

329
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,480
expecting that the first time around do

330
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:49,039
you collect pollen and save it and store

331
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,720
it for breeding in the future or do you

332
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:54,240
just let your males grow to a certain

333
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,639
point put them in with females and kind

334
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,278
of let them get down and dirty yes

335
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,360
that's a good question too so typically

336
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,039
it's

337
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,879
i mean ideally you want to do the ladder

338
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,360
you want to be able to sit a male in

339
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,120
there with the females and ultimately

340
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,800
through my experience i've seen a

341
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,919
difference in um

342
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:17,199
seed production uh bigger beautiful

343
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:20,078
seeds and better offspring um even the

344
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,879
female they seem to react to knowing

345
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,879
that the male is in the tent with them

346
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:27,039
and um they seem to perk up they seem to

347
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,399
be happier uh it just seems like a

348
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,599
better experience overall for the

349
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,120
females um but that's always not ideal

350
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,040
as far as you know

351
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,519
you can't always do it so it's much more

352
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,719
convenient to have pollen stored and uh

353
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,399
be able to you know just uh put it in

354
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,240
you know soap or just pollinate the

355
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,759
plant especially in the terms of when

356
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,959
you when you have to store pollen for

357
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,200
back crossing

358
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,838
uh back crossing is very important when

359
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,000
you're trying to stabilize the line so

360
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,839
that is um you have to slow power for

361
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,958
the most part in that sense

362
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:02,480
can you tell us how you store the pollen

363
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:04,319
uh well i would um pretty much

364
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,480
uh well depending on whether it's

365
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,879
autoflower or photo period it's a really

366
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,759
big difference so um like you said like

367
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,240
um

368
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,838
actual male plant is gonna have an

369
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,159
avalanche of pollen like it's gonna be

370
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,000
impossible not to you know so easy to

371
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,519
collect it you pretty much just wanna

372
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,200
make sure that you

373
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,200
dry it out and

374
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,959
then store it within the uh whether you

375
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,399
want to store it long term you want to

376
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,759
put it in the freezer and a little glass

377
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,759
jar or

378
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,720
you know or a refrigerator if you plan

379
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,399
to use it

380
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,920
really soon

381
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,759
but autoflowers is a much more

382
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,639
intricate process you're gonna really

383
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:43,519
have to go in and actually use tweezers

384
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,759
and pull the pollen sacs in most cases

385
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,480
the pollen is much less viable it's much

386
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:51,039
less there it's barely any so you want

387
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,759
to um collect it by tweezers as many as

388
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,679
you can pollen sac bar pollen sac at

389
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,078
that point i would then use um a

390
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,638
strainer like a bowl strainer

391
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,679
um i would use the bowl strainer and

392
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,240
kind of

393
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:07,039
shake uh shake everything i got in the

394
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,519
bowl strainer to um get the little bit

395
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,759
of pollen if so if i can get it that way

396
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,440
perfect if not much comes out then we

397
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,720
got to kind of individually break each

398
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,199
one open

399
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,920
with the tweezers and

400
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,958
remove each and every pollen sac because

401
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:22,559
um

402
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,919
that's when you get into moisture

403
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,879
moisture can

404
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:29,198
destroy pollen very easily immediately

405
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,039
and make it non-viable so you have to

406
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,278
make sure that you um

407
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:35,838
typically i use dehumidifiers as well

408
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,360
when i'm collecting power in that room

409
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,120
you want to lay it out

410
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,278
flat on the table if possible have a

411
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,679
dehumidifier keep the

412
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:44,720
humidity at least 40 or below if

413
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,039
possible

414
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,120
um you know that's the ideal

415
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,559
setting for pollen and

416
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,399
you want to uh

417
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,399
let it dry out for a couple hours make

418
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,198
sure it's completely dry no no pollen

419
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,120
sets are in there clean it out good and

420
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,519
then you can collect it once it's dry

421
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,480
and stored in like same way with a

422
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,839
regular mail with freezer or fridge okay

423
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,839
that makes sense somebody through

424
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,839
instagram asked i don't know if this is

425
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,000
true or not they said they hear that

426
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,480
keeping pollen and baking soda picking

427
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,958
powder can help so would mixing the

428
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,440
pollen into baking powder in order to

429
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:21,039
stabilize the humidity work i wouldn't

430
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,839
do it personally i've never heard that

431
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,278
method myself personally but um it's not

432
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,040
something i mean

433
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:30,000
it's always something worth looking into

434
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:31,360
or you know um we learn every day so

435
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,879
i'll definitely be looking into that

436
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,000
after the show i'll tell you that yeah

437
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,198
it was the first time i've ever heard of

438
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,799
it either i thought it was an

439
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:40,000
interesting question to bring up so

440
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:42,639
let's get into a female plants so you

441
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,399
know selecting the female what do you do

442
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,000
what characteristics you look for so on

443
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,039
and so forth

444
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,039
so the female selection process is a lot

445
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:53,519
more fun in my opinion you know everyone

446
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,879
loves females you know so in this case

447
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,360
um

448
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,879
it starts really early uh and and that's

449
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,199
why uh you

450
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:03,439
you know that's why we use or that's why

451
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,838
i use the power the paper towel

452
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,160
for germination is um that's that's when

453
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,600
the selection process starts in many

454
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,759
cases um

455
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,920
if those tap roots don't come out really

456
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,480
vigorous and strong you know i'll put

457
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,919
them to the side you know i'll mark them

458
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,440
but you know you want to start that

459
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,838
selection process right there within

460
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,399
that paper towel and um that's when the

461
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,320
fun begins you know you get to actually

462
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,720
see and you know you do the same stem

463
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,720
rubs and but you you know you know it's

464
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,360
going to be a female so you pretty much

465
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,560
it's a visible it's a visible thing when

466
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,039
you have um

467
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:40,078
multiple plants to select from

468
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:41,679
typically uh you know you just gotta

469
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:43,599
know what to look for

470
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,958
so you're you're even from the beginning

471
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,480
you're killing off plants right away

472
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,919
from when they're seed now are you

473
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,440
looking for things while they're growing

474
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:53,679
in veg seedlings are you wiping out

475
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,680
seedlings are you i'm right now

476
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,078
not all the seeds are going to make it

477
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,479
out of the paper towel uh even even the

478
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,399
ones that have uh decent tap roots that

479
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,519
they may not you know if i'm looking for

480
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,519
real real bigger then i need to um make

481
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,359
sure i'm only picking the biggest

482
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,119
strongest ones with the biggest

483
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,000
strongest tattoos and then from there

484
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,399
yeah absolutely um we we start the

485
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,880
stress test on females pretty early as

486
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,959
well so because um you know that

487
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,280
hermaphroditic trait can uh that's when

488
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,759
it'll come out in a female pretty early

489
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,918
during the veg stage whether it's light

490
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,879
or uh you know heat or those are

491
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,679
typically i'll even use artificial when

492
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,360
um you know exploring high winds on it

493
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,759
and um

494
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,599
nitrogen spikes and things like that

495
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:42,400
typically if that if that trait is

496
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,079
dominant uh we just want to we can bring

497
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,840
it out pretty pretty early during the

498
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,038
veg stage in a few

499
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,399
pretty easy

500
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,720
so you get the female plant growing all

501
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,038
the way into flower you know as it's

502
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,200
going along you're you're killing off

503
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,038
plants are there any particular

504
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,319
characteristics that you're looking for

505
00:17:57,038 --> 00:17:59,919
in the female plant i don't know if you

506
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:03,839
touched on that typically the same that

507
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,440
we look for within a a male besides um

508
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,759
it's just it's just a lot more obvious

509
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,519
like trichome production of course when

510
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,079
you know you're getting those trichomes

511
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:14,400
really early and uh all hanging out on

512
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:17,279
the fan leaves and you know those are

513
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,360
always really good signs um you know

514
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,359
terpene profiles from that stem rub i

515
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,279
always stress that it's so important on

516
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,959
my lives we always do it as a fun you

517
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:26,399
know fun thing together we get up there

518
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,558
and we're all rubbing and we're like hey

519
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,559
oh my gosh you know

520
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,079
you know it's always a but it's such an

521
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:33,678
important thing because it really does

522
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:36,079
give you those profiles and gives you an

523
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,240
idea and um you can you can see the

524
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:39,599
differences even within the same

525
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,759
genes you know you can see the

526
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,480
differences and smell the differences

527
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,160
and um that's that's a big selective for

528
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,240
me and um

529
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,440
but but during the late flower stage you

530
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,200
just um

531
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,519
kind of just want to

532
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,558
your focus is so much at that point it

533
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:59,279
begins so much on seed production at

534
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:00,879
that point so you kind of you kind of

535
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,160
back off what we typically would

536
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,880
normally be using for a normal uh

537
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,840
medicinal plant uh and producing flour

538
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,799
you know the phosphorus and then the

539
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:13,199
potassium and you know we kind of kind

540
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,879
of back i mean potassium is okay but the

541
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,960
phosphorus and stuff we typically back

542
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,280
off and uh kind of just keep running a

543
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,600
little nitrogen and um

544
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,720
and whatever else we may need but um at

545
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,798
that point

546
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,798
yeah you're pretty much already selected

547
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,879
once you get to that stage

548
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,440
okay so you've actually selected the

549
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,880
female within the flower stage at the

550
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,720
point where it needs to be pollinated

551
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,919
you don't actually

552
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,960
grow a plant take clones finish off

553
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,038
plants

554
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,160
oh yeah oh um

555
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:47,519
well yeah for males mostly we we we use

556
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,320
cloning as a big for males but um

557
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:53,679
with females i don't necessarily have to

558
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:54,960
cut as many clones you always do as a

559
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,440
precaution

560
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,798
typically just to be sure and always be

561
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,720
able to go back

562
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,558
but males sometimes you're cutting two

563
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,960
clones per map

564
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:07,279
just to make sure that they all get out

565
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,360
there successfully and you know you want

566
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:12,079
to test them and make sure it's just a

567
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,839
lot more testing uh clones with a male

568
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,079
than it is a female

569
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:18,000
okay so you are actually completing the

570
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,759
female smoking it

571
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,558
and then taking the clones of that

572
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:24,240
female and using that to pollinate

573
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:25,279
yeah it's a lot of painful yeah

574
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,359
typically

575
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,359
yeah all that's pretty much the whole

576
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,199
program is cloning

577
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,959
male and female mostly clowning because

578
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,759
you got to be able to go back every

579
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,798
vegin we do some reversion at times um

580
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:41,200
with females we re veg um i particularly

581
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,639
don't do it as much because um we got

582
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,480
cloning you know

583
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,559
as long as you're working with a that's

584
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,240
why i try to select early on in the

585
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,879
process so we don't have too many

586
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,519
females to have the clone from

587
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,840
but with males you kind of

588
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,679
it's a much tougher process you you know

589
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,279
i try to use other

590
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,360
other people to help me in that case

591
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,119
when it comes to males because meals you

592
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:05,199
don't want to even

593
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,959
sit them together you know even

594
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,720
separated from females even them

595
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,960
together they'll even

596
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,279
cross pollinate each other like not well

597
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,960
not you know but you don't want pollen

598
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:15,759
from one male being on another male that

599
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,519
you

600
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:18,240
you know because it happens so you want

601
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,079
to

602
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,440
actually separate them individually as

603
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,359
well

604
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,759
you know it gets kind of tricky so

605
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,759
clones are very important

606
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,079
okay that makes sense and now around

607
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:32,319
what day of flower do you typically

608
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:35,279
pollinate the females

609
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:37,359
ah well we try to pollinate exactly

610
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,319
around the time when we're seeing those

611
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,639
first

612
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:42,399
white pistols start to bunch up

613
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,759
you know we've seen those white pistols

614
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,400
because we know those are the pistols

615
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:48,079
that typically catch that pollen and uh

616
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,519
whether you uh if you have a male just

617
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,759
hanging in there you might want to you

618
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:53,679
know just shake a shake a little bit in

619
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,480
there and uh you know you always kind of

620
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,000
want to start your mail off earlier

621
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,480
you know you want to start the mail off

622
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
earlier and uh once because the female

623
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,640
is going to take you know especially

624
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,640
with a regular metal it's not much you

625
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,159
really have to do in that case unless

626
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,600
you you've stored polling you're

627
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,400
bringing it back

628
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:12,639
uh

629
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,320
to artificially inseminate

630
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,880
okay and then

631
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,158
what's the ideal flower time once

632
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,320
pollinated

633
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,000
for healthy seeds

634
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,200
that's a good question yes so

635
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,480
typically

636
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,080
seeded flowers take longer to develop

637
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,519
they usually take longer than an

638
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,639
unseated um

639
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:32,639
female and

640
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,879
in general seven weeks um

641
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,200
eight weeks

642
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,760
typically you'll you'll generally notice

643
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,440
it's when it comes to see you know

644
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:44,240
season general it's a really visual

645
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,679
thing

646
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,440
um

647
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,759
not really much you can sort of sort of

648
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,880
similar to trifolds it's really visual

649
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:52,798
thing

650
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,880
you know once you see the uh

651
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,798
the casing kind of cracked or

652
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,200
you know you kind of visually see the

653
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:01,679
seed it looks like it's developed based

654
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,840
on color and size that's pretty much all

655
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,679
you determine determining factors right

656
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,038
there i gotta imagine that genetics has

657
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,559
something to do with it as well right if

658
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:10,079
you have like a 12-week

659
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,399
flowering uh

660
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,000
flowering strain right

661
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,840
it will probably need to go longer than

662
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,759
the seven eight weeks that you mentioned

663
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,399
so but yeah i mean i think you bring up

664
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:22,240
a good point is like um because i've

665
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,159
technically i'm a breeder yeah i don't

666
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,798
call myself a breeder but

667
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,360
vader og called me a breeder because

668
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:31,839
i did one cross i made one cross it was

669
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:34,319
brisk grow g cross with pakistan valley

670
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,439
so technically i'm a breeder but

671
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,879
i know exactly what you mean when you

672
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,720
say that it's kind of like you can see

673
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,760
like the calyx is open with the seed

674
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,120
popping out and you can see like the

675
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,440
color of the seeds and so on and so

676
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,278
forth so you kind of get an idea then

677
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,120
it's visible so i totally understand

678
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,038
what you mean by that one so okay so i

679
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:50,639
know the answer to this next question

680
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:52,480
but i'm still going to ask it just

681
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,840
because there's an audience here that

682
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,278
probably doesn't know the answer some

683
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:58,480
people don't know the answer should

684
00:23:55,278 --> 00:24:00,240
pollen from a female producing nanners

685
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,038
be used for breeding so the banana is

686
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,120
the

687
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:06,079
the male stamen that comes out it

688
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:09,038
depends on how the manners were created

689
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,079
so if we have purposely stressed the

690
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:14,319
female

691
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:16,798
um to create manners in a sense of like

692
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:19,839
light stress or heat stress

693
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:21,639
that's not and and then we we

694
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:24,399
bring that that

695
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,559
hermaphrodite methodic trait

696
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,880
uh out to the forefront then it was

697
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:31,038
dominant in the first place right so we

698
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,640
don't want to use that for breeding

699
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:34,720
stock

700
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,720
now in a sense where

701
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,120
manners were created

702
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,480
by the female herself

703
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:44,158
in that last ditch effort to you know

704
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:47,360
self-pollinate and preserve her own

705
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:50,400
genetics in that sense

706
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:52,719
she wasn't uh that that most likely that

707
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,278
homophobic trait wasn't dominant in her

708
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,120
she did it herself uh you know towards

709
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,278
the end thinking like oh you know this

710
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:02,319
is the end of my life cycle got apology

711
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:03,759
i haven't been pollinated got a pollen

712
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:06,240
so in that sense it's really good

713
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:09,440
because technically that's uh

714
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,440
self pollination which uh the offspring

715
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,400
uh of every self pollination are gonna

716
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,400
be 50 more stable

717
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,840
and um so that's why i say it gets

718
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,240
tricky when we use the term

719
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,839
hermaphrodite or hermit uh it's really

720
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,599
important in knowing how it was

721
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,678
developed and you know we've got two

722
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,759
different type of hermes technically we

723
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,159
have um ball sex

724
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,400
which um which typically come from us

725
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:36,240
reversing a female whether we're using

726
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,400
colloidal silver or uh jubilee acid or

727
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,720
whatever method you're using within

728
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,519
stopping the product the the production

729
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,919
of ethylene and and causing the female

730
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,400
to then create male parts so in that

731
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,240
case that's also not uh the

732
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,320
hermaphroditic trait most likely is not

733
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,200
dominant in that case uh it's most

734
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,519
likely recessive and um

735
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,880
you know depending on you know it could

736
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:01,278
be either way but

737
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,480
you know you would know if you know in

738
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:03,759
that case

739
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,120
because we wouldn't use it in the first

740
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:06,640
place but

741
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,639
in that case yeah it's most likely not

742
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,640
dominant it would be dominant in the

743
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,840
case where we

744
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,600
use stress to create manners yeah that's

745
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,678
that's not good we don't want to use

746
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,079
that as breeding stock okay we'll get

747
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,360
deeper into feminizing in a little bit

748
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,678
here i want to stick on

749
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,119
hermaphrodites for one a few more

750
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,200
questions here so

751
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,359
should pollen from

752
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,840
pollen sex coming from a hermaphrodite

753
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,359
so their mafia i'm talking about is say

754
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:34,959
the plant grows

755
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,158
flip it over to flower stretch on

756
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,880
pistols

757
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,600
shortly after you see pollen sacks there

758
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,840
should that be used for breeding

759
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,839
no so that is what we're talking about

760
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,519
in the case of a natural herb okay

761
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,759
that's that's more of a natural harm

762
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:52,400
with that well that trait is dominant in

763
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:55,440
that and so that that's gonna also pass

764
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,720
off that dominant trait to the offspring

765
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,360
uh and many of those uh offspring are

766
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,240
gonna have or just like you you said

767
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:05,439
going to flower and produce pollen sacks

768
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,519
and then you did mention through

769
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,759
instagram that it's important to

770
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,599
understand the hermaphroditic trait what

771
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:13,278
are some other things that we should

772
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,359
kind of know about that that you haven't

773
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,519
talked about yet

774
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:20,158
just

775
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:22,720
knowing and being able to answer ask the

776
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,120
qualifying questions to a breeder so um

777
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,798
in many cases uh you know

778
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:28,798
growers they get the

779
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:31,038
hermes you know they get the herme

780
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,278
hermaphroditic treat and they panic and

781
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:35,839
they say oh what you know what's going

782
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:36,880
on you know the breeders blaming you

783
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:38,639
they're blaming the lights they're

784
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,799
blaming the you know they're blaming the

785
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,720
humidity oh it's your environment the

786
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:44,879
you know the growers like no it's you

787
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,640
you got bad genetics you're not stable

788
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,000
so we have to find a medium and the

789
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,880
medium is education so if you know

790
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,960
what

791
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,600
to look for and you know what to expect

792
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,600
and you know why um this may have hurt

793
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:00,558
me in the first place then you you're in

794
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,079
a much better position you know as to

795
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,879
no one having to point the finger and

796
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,798
say could you say hey well maybe i i

797
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,480
might have let this female uh uh you

798
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,639
know sit for a little bit longer than i

799
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,240
normally should have and you know i can

800
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,640
tell that's probably why i may have six

801
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,839
or seven seeds in the bud here

802
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,600
but um or if you know you

803
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,720
you know you

804
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:24,558
you're dealing with unstable uh genetics

805
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,720
and that is a thing that is a real thing

806
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:28,720
and that's why when we're dealing with

807
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,759
uh f1s and

808
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,399
you know

809
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:35,119
really dealing with the uh

810
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:37,398
uh unstable even with f2s we're dealing

811
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:41,599
with a large variety

812
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:43,678
of genetics so you want to uh

813
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:46,639
really do your best to take your time

814
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,720
and be patient and stabilize your

815
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,200
your genetics as much as possible so

816
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,360
that uh it goes both ways and you gotta

817
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,120
meet in the middle of education so

818
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,199
okay that's good info

819
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:59,759
feminized seeds let's move on to them

820
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,919
they're becoming more and more popular

821
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,919
people love to be able to plant a seed

822
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,520
and just about always

823
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,919
guaran just about guaranteed that it's

824
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:11,519
going to be female 9 times out of 10 or

825
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:14,000
maybe 9.9 times out of 10.

826
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,000
how do you create feminized seeds

827
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,960
um through reversing the female and

828
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,640
stopping the production of ethylene

829
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,480
the ethylene uh

830
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,720
once you stop it or once you slow it

831
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,679
down the female starts to

832
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,759
create

833
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,080
pollen sex and male parts

834
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:33,200
and uh that's that's what at that point

835
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:34,558
we can typically pollinate a female and

836
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,840
create feminized seeds so all the

837
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,000
offspring

838
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:39,439
will be female offspring and there are

839
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,119
several different ways you can do that

840
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,278
right do you want to touch into the

841
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:45,119
different ways collateral silver

842
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:46,960
gibberellic acid can you talk to us

843
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,719
about those ones

844
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,159
yeah so uh

845
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,159
colloidal silver is probably the most

846
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,000
popular one um something you can

847
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,320
actually even make at home i mean i

848
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,200
don't make it myself

849
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:01,678
i do uh typically make my own

850
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,120
mixtures of colloidal silver uh

851
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,240
individual guys that i try different

852
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:08,639
things but typically you can go with uh

853
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,120
50 parts per million 40 parts per

854
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,000
million colloidal silver which is a

855
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:16,239
actually silver you know a silver and a

856
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,079
distilled water a little bit of

857
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,558
conductivity in there and then you got

858
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:22,879
colloidal silver um

859
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:24,720
that's pretty much my recommended method

860
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,640
uh that is probably the most popular

861
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,159
method in my opinion um so

862
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,559
it's pretty simple that that's that's

863
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,520
typically how most breeders will reverse

864
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:38,000
a female when would you apply that

865
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:40,319
uh during i will start around

866
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
two weeks three weeks vegetative stage

867
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,079
you want to start uh you want to start

868
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,440
as early as possible you want to hit the

869
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:47,519
corners you want to hit as much it

870
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,960
depends i mean how you're you know you

871
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:50,240
have different methods of reversing as

872
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,759
well some breeders might just want to

873
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,079
reverse one plant

874
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,319
only one branch rather i'm sorry one

875
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,960
branch as to where uh you know me

876
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:00,480
typically i'll reverse the entire plant

877
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,798
so i start really early i just start

878
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,399
spraying the entire plant but if um

879
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,558
you're more concerned about just one

880
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,079
branch then you might start

881
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:10,558
just focusing on that one branch

882
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,079
covering the rest of it um and uh being

883
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:15,038
able to spray that one branch in about

884
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:17,439
three weeks two to three weeks and uh

885
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:19,278
some people two to three four times a

886
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,600
day it's kind of up to you and it's

887
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:24,000
really strange specific uh you you know

888
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:25,599
that it's pretty strange specific some

889
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,599
some strings are really hardy with it

890
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:30,480
you don't like to be reversed so you may

891
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:32,959
have to apply a stronger solution more

892
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,880
more times per day uh and some are

893
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,200
really sensitive to it so

894
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,720
but that's typically the method we use

895
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,038
okay so you're doing you're spraying in

896
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,360
veg and then are you flipping the

897
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:44,879
flowering let them flower and still

898
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:48,479
continuing to spray or when you stop

899
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:51,840
that spray it depends on autoflower or

900
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,720
photo period so in a case of autoflower

901
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,759
um

902
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,640
you kind of know when she's reversed

903
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:00,480
when she starts growing those uh bowls

904
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,600
of pollen stacks you can kind of you can

905
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,558
stop with you know and with a um

906
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:08,240
a male or i'm sorry a photo period you

907
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:10,240
want to just um

908
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,798
start in about three

909
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,319
give it about three four weeks of uh

910
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:18,639
about a month of spray flip it to flower

911
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:19,519
and um continue for about another two

912
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,799
weeks

913
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,399
and you should see

914
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:24,319
you know you should see the results

915
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:25,599
probably within a week or two so

916
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,720
basically what will happen the plan will

917
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:30,879
start producing nanners right and then

918
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,640
you would harvest bananas or how does

919
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,320
that or it would self-pollinate and then

920
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,759
you would it would just grow seeds on

921
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,558
that particular plant

922
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:38,640
well

923
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:41,359
in the case of a reverse female she's

924
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,600
gonna grow actual power sets like a male

925
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,918
would okay so yeah we're actually

926
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:46,719
stopping the process of ethylene which

927
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,679
um

928
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,600
causes her to kind of turn into half men

929
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,679
so in that case it's not necessarily

930
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:55,759
nana's nanners are always gonna be

931
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,159
related to stress

932
00:32:55,759 --> 00:33:00,960
whether it's bad stress that we caused

933
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,799
or whether it's stress that the female

934
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,919
caused on her own

935
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:05,599
but um

936
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,600
those um

937
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,439
those we don't want to collect for we

938
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:10,798
don't want to collect nanos for uh

939
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,960
pollen uh

940
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,038
to use as um

941
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,480
uh you know a gin you know we don't want

942
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:19,038
to breed those

943
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,798
we only want to breed male pollen sets

944
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,720
balls so we can kind of relate it to

945
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,158
that if it doesn't have bulb if it's not

946
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,798
balls then we don't want to use it to

947
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,000
breathe gotcha how about gibberellic

948
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:29,918
accent

949
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,679
acid yeah i don't i don't use it as much

950
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,399
i don't i don't

951
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,720
i mean i i use it a little bit in a

952
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:39,359
mixture that i've tried

953
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,519
that i'm working on but i don't i don't

954
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:44,479
i don't recommend it uh i would i only

955
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,000
recommend colloidal silver

956
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,000
because um that's that's what i've

957
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
always used and that's what i'm always

958
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,278
i'm just starting to try a new mixture

959
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,880
but uh

960
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,599
i mean either way i always go back to

961
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,480
just quarters so we try we experiment

962
00:33:55,599 --> 00:34:00,240
with different things all the time but

963
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,000
you know that's how we learn

964
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,679
yep what's the best way to stress a

965
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,679
female without using chemicals

966
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,720
stress a female without using chemicals

967
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:13,280
if you want to um

968
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:16,000
stress test stress in order to kind of

969
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,800
get them to i guess self-pollinate and

970
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,639
create feminine seeds right okay so so a

971
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,000
female is going to self-pollinate our

972
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,320
own so for for anybody interested in um

973
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,878
wanting to um

974
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,879
getting to stabilize you know first-time

975
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:33,199
breeders i would recommend

976
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:35,358
self-pollination being that

977
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,678
rotalization is what what is the term

978
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:38,799
realization is where we typically will

979
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,599
let the

980
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,919
mm the female plant uh take a little bit

981
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,519
longer than we necessarily would and

982
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,440
we'll end up with some seeds out of that

983
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:49,759
so that's gonna be stable it's going to

984
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,240
be 50 percent more stable the offspring

985
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,399
than the mother plant was as well as um

986
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,679
you know it's a good way to kind of get

987
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,639
your feet wet

988
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:03,679
but we don't ever want to

989
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:05,838
stress a female out purposely to use her

990
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:08,319
power to create

991
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:10,400
because if we can stress a female out

992
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,320
and make her create manners then that

993
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,519
means the hermaphroditic trait is

994
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,519
dominant

995
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:17,199
in her genes so we don't want it she's

996
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:18,639
not breeding stock in that case we want

997
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,679
to put her to the side we don't want to

998
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:22,719
use that

999
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:24,480
okay yeah that's interesting that wasn't

1000
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,639
as good so that was a listener uh

1001
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,159
question it was through instagram

1002
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:30,239
that's a really good question because it

1003
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,319
does get really tricky and that's why i

1004
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,479
always stress to um

1005
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,960
get as much education as we can as far

1006
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,880
as the hermaphroditic trait and

1007
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,199
manners and pollen sex and the

1008
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,800
difference between the two and how nanos

1009
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:45,679
are created how pollen sex can be

1010
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,680
created and um

1011
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,598
how they relate to feminized seeds

1012
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,960
because everyone loves feminized seeds

1013
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,800
it's like i want feminize i want yeah

1014
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,119
you got feminized i want feminize and

1015
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,280
i'm like you know so you know sometimes

1016
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,280
i'm a pain because i'm like hey hey

1017
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,760
check this article out you know if you

1018
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,519
don't know do you know about this and

1019
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,119
why why do you really want feminized

1020
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,519
seeds you know you know do you

1021
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,039
understand that the risk and the risk in

1022
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,400
feminist seeds because it is a little

1023
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:12,559
bit of risk you know we're dealing with

1024
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,240
hermaphroditic traits and so you want to

1025
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:15,599
go in and when you

1026
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:17,679
when you go to a breeder and you're

1027
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,838
asking them for feminized seeds i also

1028
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:21,679
want my my team to be able to ask those

1029
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:23,920
follow-up questions well what generation

1030
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,519
has your feminized seas been bred to how

1031
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,519
long have you what are some of the

1032
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,599
traits that you breathe for with within

1033
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,679
your feminized seats what's the chances

1034
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,079
that they might i might get manners uh

1035
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:35,598
during early in the flower stage now you

1036
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,440
asked a breeder these type of questions

1037
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,800
and they're like hold up you know either

1038
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,159
they're gonna be legitimate or they're

1039
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,920
gonna back off and say you know what i

1040
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:43,679
don't want your business get out of here

1041
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,838
you know and um that's that's the kind

1042
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,358
of we want that on both ends we want we

1043
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:48,480
want to be educated

1044
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:50,319
makes sense

1045
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,079
yeah just one last thing on that last

1046
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,000
question this particular person said

1047
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,160
that the question was how do you stress

1048
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
a female to her without using chemicals

1049
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:01,679
he had mentioned he's been using light

1050
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,320
to do that he would move it from 12 12

1051
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:06,960
to 18 6 cur for a couple days and then

1052
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,200
back to 12 12. so you're saying you

1053
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,519
shouldn't do that because it's it's it's

1054
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:13,519
stressing well you can do it so we do

1055
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:14,400
that to to

1056
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:16,639
just

1057
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,800
to look for sexual stability so that's

1058
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:20,480
the only time i use light or heat in

1059
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,640
order to stress a female because i want

1060
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,039
to see if she's sexually stable enough

1061
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:27,519
now if i know if i put light on her and

1062
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:29,119
she she's um she withstands it and she

1063
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,280
doesn't hurt me then she's sexually

1064
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,440
stable so she's good breeding stuff but

1065
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,920
if i put light on her and heat or her

1066
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,960
and she terms out then i'm you know i'm

1067
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,960
cutting her she's no good she's bad

1068
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,440
because if i use her to breed if i use

1069
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,599
that pollen that was so easy to flip

1070
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,760
like that into a herm then that pollen

1071
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,880
is also going to be uh or the offspring

1072
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,200
are also going to have that treat

1073
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,200
dominant within their genes

1074
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:54,399
gotcha and you mentioned heat can you

1075
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,480
talk to us about a little bit more like

1076
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,160
what how much heat like when do we apply

1077
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,800
it so and so forth in order to stress it

1078
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:04,719
that way yeah i mean uh 80 85 and up i

1079
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:07,039
would say 89 90 any 90 and up is a good

1080
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:09,598
indicator of uh heat stress

1081
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:12,880
if you can go to 100 if you if you can

1082
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,320
um but anything anything above 89 i

1083
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,880
would say is

1084
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,800
typically

1085
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,320
90 depending on your environment

1086
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,000
depending on the strain everything is

1087
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,440
really strain related too

1088
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,039
you know especially

1089
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,838
we can get deep with that indica and

1090
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:30,000
sativa you know related stuff and you

1091
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:32,639
know so it's so related to that and how

1092
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,199
how they handle heat and stresses

1093
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:37,199
but um yeah i would say 90s

1094
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,639
is a good uh

1095
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:40,399
stressor

1096
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:42,879
but yeah like light is definitely a good

1097
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,680
stressor you can um you can apply light

1098
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,800
and and definitely flip flip a female to

1099
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:49,759
her but

1100
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,560
once she does that we she's no good

1101
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,599
good info okay good to know autoflower

1102
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:57,279
seeds another popular thing out of are

1103
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,400
more and more

1104
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,400
yeah so how do you create those seeds um

1105
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,039
same way

1106
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,039
those are generally feminized seeds uh

1107
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:09,039
most likely

1108
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:12,159
they are regular as well but the

1109
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:14,239
popularity uh popularity of feminized

1110
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:15,358
seeds and autoflower kind of ran neck

1111
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:17,039
and neck so

1112
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:19,920
now we just got

1113
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:22,639
feminized autoflower everywhere and

1114
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,599
same process we reverse a female with

1115
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:27,199
colloidal silver and uh use that pollen

1116
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,359
collect that pollen it's a much more

1117
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:32,480
intricate like i said it's a much more

1118
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:34,480
uh difficult process uh

1119
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,960
requires much more patience and much

1120
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,039
more time consuming but um that's what

1121
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,679
you want to use a you know definitely

1122
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:44,400
have your tweezers handy and be able to

1123
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:47,440
collect each individual pollen sac as

1124
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,920
they uh as they develop and uh

1125
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,240
collect as much pollen as possible to be

1126
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,519
able to use and store if it's even

1127
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:55,039
enough to store

1128
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,519
but that's when it gets tricky

1129
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:59,599
autoflowers there's more and more seed

1130
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:02,079
banks that and breeders that are

1131
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,318
releasing autoflowers and they don't and

1132
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,440
actually end up being autoflowers so

1133
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,079
stability comes into question you know

1134
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,480
and

1135
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,800
i heard you have to breed multiple

1136
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,039
multiple levels down in order to

1137
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,519
stabilize what exactly does it mean to

1138
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:21,119
stabilize a variety

1139
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:24,239
so to stabilize is simply just reducing

1140
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,240
genetic variability just reducing

1141
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,479
variability

1142
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:31,199
ultimately we want to

1143
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,159
achieve heterozygous

1144
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:36,960
i'm sorry homozygous status we want to

1145
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,799
retrieve homo homozygosity in a sense

1146
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,440
where uh

1147
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,160
that's just one phenotype

1148
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,480
uh two two particular one particular

1149
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,440
alleles or one particular version per

1150
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,920
gene

1151
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,519
and um that is homozygous status that's

1152
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,599
what we want to achieve

1153
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:54,559
through generations of selective

1154
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,760
breeding

1155
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,759
um we we

1156
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:01,759
we dumb it down in just one

1157
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:03,598
phenotype

1158
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,000
and that's uh that's what it is to

1159
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,000
stabilize the strain okay and then for

1160
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,519
autoflowers in particular i heard you

1161
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,920
need like i mentioned you go down

1162
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:13,838
multiple generations is there

1163
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,760
is it like four generations down or what

1164
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:17,599
was the do you know

1165
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,200
well either way um it's multiple

1166
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,720
generations if you're stabilizing the

1167
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,559
string you're never going to be able to

1168
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:23,759
stabilize the string without going down

1169
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:28,078
multiple

1170
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:30,880
uh f2 f3 f4 f5 you'll get to you may get

1171
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,079
in that's the thing too so stabilizing

1172
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,559
is also

1173
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,800
in the sense of the breeder uh what you

1174
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,519
may consider stable may not be stable to

1175
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,000
me

1176
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:42,960
so you may think like hey i got my

1177
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,000
greens you know i got my vigor i got my

1178
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,159
big buds i'm stable you know but most

1179
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,280
important is sexual stability we have to

1180
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:51,519
selective

1181
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,200
however long it takes to selective breed

1182
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:56,400
and inbreed or

1183
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:59,358
line breed or inbred line ibl in terms

1184
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,000
of what we call ibf uh we have to go

1185
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:04,559
down that line in ibl for several

1186
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,280
generations until we remove

1187
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:09,358
the hermaphroditic trait as well as try

1188
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,160
to catch all of the things that we like

1189
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:12,960
uh

1190
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:13,679
trichome develop our production uh you

1191
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,440
know

1192
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,358
you may want purple buds as well but all

1193
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,760
of those are secondary to sexual

1194
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:21,279
stability and sexual stability takes

1195
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,440
years that takes

1196
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,760
four five six seven generations you can

1197
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,318
pick up on the cool stuff along the way

1198
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,440
but um until you run into that roadblock

1199
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:32,318
of uh

1200
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:35,760
after about the eighth eighth f eight uh

1201
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:38,880
f7 f8 you'll run into a roadblock of our

1202
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,480
being technically sterile where um you

1203
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,240
you're like okay now

1204
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,599
um i'm

1205
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:48,239
sexually stable uh but no further i can

1206
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,240
go that's when we back cross that's when

1207
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:52,559
we go back to the parent

1208
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,519
we bring out that stored pollen and uh

1209
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,159
you know

1210
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:57,759
then we can go back and re re-enter some

1211
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:59,519
of those traits that we loved in the

1212
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,440
beginning that's the correct way to do

1213
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:02,800
it but yeah it's going to take years no

1214
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,280
matter what if you want to have a good

1215
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,240
line it's going to take years that makes

1216
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,079
sense

1217
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:10,318
good information there

1218
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,800
okay so next one is another listener

1219
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:14,400
question it has to do with the chart so

1220
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,240
i'm going to put this chart on the

1221
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,720
screen right now if you're watching on

1222
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:20,879
youtube if you are on one of the podcast

1223
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:22,480
platforms maybe you can explain it for

1224
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,440
them this chart that i'm showing right

1225
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,159
now you can see you know from the top p1

1226
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:32,079
male p1 female and then it goes down you

1227
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:34,159
get your f1s your f2s f3 is f4 z5z6 and

1228
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,039
then actually it connects back

1229
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:39,199
to a p1 new generation first could you

1230
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:42,960
explain this chart for us in layman's

1231
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:45,199
terms all right so so p1 is going to be

1232
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,679
the parent uh the parent generation

1233
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:49,118
that's what we starting off with uh

1234
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:51,199
mother and father

1235
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,280
so that is um

1236
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:56,399
that is uh where we're basically

1237
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,240
starting off the the generation the

1238
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,680
outcross of the mother

1239
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:02,000
and the father

1240
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:03,358
that is the start of their generation

1241
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,119
and that's um

1242
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:07,279
that's those offspring are going to get

1243
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,599
us into f1

1244
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,440
all right those offspring are gonna are

1245
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,280
gonna get us to f1 so the difference

1246
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,639
between f1

1247
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,599
and f2

1248
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:17,920
is

1249
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,640
f1 is the

1250
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:24,720
start using the parents

1251
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:27,679
f2 is the actual start of the line

1252
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:28,719
of the inbred line using the offspring

1253
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:31,759
so

1254
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:34,799
in this case when you see f2 f2 f2

1255
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,480
that's when we've opened up to

1256
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,440
the most variety

1257
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,719
the most

1258
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,039
choices of of choosing our phenotypes

1259
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:44,399
and our characteristics and our elios is

1260
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:46,639
what we call

1261
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,800
our versions of what we uh that's when

1262
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:51,118
we start our selective breeding process

1263
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,599
that f2 generation and then from there

1264
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,480
is what you pretty much see

1265
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,318
is the selective process of

1266
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,559
him picking or

1267
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:02,960
whoever it is picking picking certain

1268
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:05,440
offspring there and um

1269
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,599
you know breeding them together

1270
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,159
and as we go down

1271
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,240
we just run into different generations

1272
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:14,000
uh

1273
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:16,159
at attempts to stabilize the strain you

1274
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,400
got a and these are all

1275
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:21,838
um characteristics

1276
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:24,960
that are being uh selectively bred for

1277
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:27,199
uh we go down into f4 f4

1278
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,519
so yeah he kind of stops in f6 and

1279
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:31,679
that's typically uh at that point where

1280
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:34,318
i would generally

1281
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:36,559
back cross back to the parent and that's

1282
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:38,480
where you see p1 all over again so it's

1283
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,159
funny that's how we spoke just about

1284
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,199
that right before so that was that's

1285
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:42,879
cool

1286
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:44,318
really cool chart that's that's genetic

1287
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,039
mapping right there that's what we use

1288
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:50,159
for uh you know

1289
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:53,358
use to for reference gotcha gotcha so

1290
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:55,519
definitely a good chart to have on hand

1291
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:56,559
the question that had in regards to this

1292
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:59,119
chart is

1293
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:01,519
if two parents are bred together which

1294
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,519
level of generational offspring will

1295
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:05,280
show the strongest level of expressions

1296
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:09,358
and terpenes

1297
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:12,880
okay so that is a awesome question

1298
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:14,639
but we're not necessarily going to so

1299
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,640
what so

1300
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:19,759
you'll get the most variety in the f2

1301
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:21,519
generation so you'll probably find your

1302
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,760
your best options and your strongest

1303
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:25,199
terpenes and variety right there in the

1304
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,599
f2 generation because you'll have more

1305
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,879
to choose from okay that's where that's

1306
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,160
what that's what we want to start our

1307
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,160
hunt for that's what we want to start

1308
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:34,799
looking into f2s a lot of people think

1309
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:36,078
it's f1s that are you know i mean i

1310
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,680
think that was the misinformation that

1311
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,960
was passed around

1312
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:42,799
yeah it shows you right here in the

1313
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,960
chart you see the f1 is um only limited

1314
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,200
amount of offspring compared to f2 we

1315
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,920
have a wide variety we kind of open up

1316
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:51,679
the gene pool at that point and we get

1317
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,519
such a wide selection and that's where

1318
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:55,039
we start the selective breeding process

1319
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,960
to say hey because we're going to get

1320
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:58,960
instability as well we get a wide

1321
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,358
variety where we get instability so now

1322
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,679
we have to focus on selective breeding

1323
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:05,679
and making sure that we stabilize or

1324
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,480
work towards stabilizing by picking the

1325
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:08,000
right

1326
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,760
picking the right uh

1327
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,318
the right offspring

1328
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,520
now what's your opinion on breeders

1329
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:16,960
releasing f1s versus releasing f2s work

1330
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:18,239
versus

1331
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,159
you know is there something that they

1332
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:21,838
should only release

1333
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:24,000
stability purposes for example do you

1334
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,920
feel like in your opinion that breeders

1335
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,318
should only release stable genetics that

1336
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,680
are you know f5s f6s or whatever

1337
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:35,920
that's a good question but i can't say

1338
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:38,399
that i would suggest people only because

1339
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,400
we need genetics too we need we we need

1340
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,639
to experience you know we need to

1341
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,480
experience so um if everything was

1342
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:45,759
stable it's like that would be a perfect

1343
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,159
world right we don't want to live in a

1344
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,040
perfect world we want to be able to um

1345
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:53,279
experience these things and

1346
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:55,920
apply some of the education that we that

1347
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,319
we learned into right right there uh

1348
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,519
hands-on and to be able to do that you

1349
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:02,239
know i don't i don't have anything

1350
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:06,000
against f1s but you gotta educate like

1351
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:08,799
me personally i uh you know i educate my

1352
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,960
people and say hey this you know this is

1353
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,720
f1 typically i only offer it in a

1354
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,039
certain way typically like an auction or

1355
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:17,118
something like that but um

1356
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:18,558
and when i do you know i make sure that

1357
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,400
they understand

1358
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,160
like hey you know and it's sort of like

1359
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,240
when i deal with dogs you know if i sold

1360
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:26,558
you a puppy i'm like man hey you gonna

1361
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:27,838
send me pictures or you know you like

1362
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,839
you know i'm calling every week they're

1363
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:31,199
like all right man she's good you know

1364
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:33,199
but that's kind of same way with the

1365
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,799
genetics you know you want to it's like

1366
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:36,480
your offspring or your children you know

1367
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,480
you kind of want to follow up and make

1368
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,838
sure that the new parents they're okay

1369
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,920
they're well taken care of and that they

1370
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:43,358
don't run into any issues so typically

1371
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,039
when you do that it's not a problem

1372
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:47,279
giving out f1s you just got to keep a

1373
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:49,279
good relationship and customer service

1374
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,200
is always first

1375
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,640
okay that's a good answer talking about

1376
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,239
dogs i want to touch on this real quick

1377
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:55,679
it doesn't have to be a long answer but

1378
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:56,959
can you tell us like some of the things

1379
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:59,279
that are

1380
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,800
the same for dog breeding and plant

1381
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,119
breeding and then also some things that

1382
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,318
are different for dog breeding versus

1383
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,000
plant breeding

1384
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:10,000
yeah for sure um

1385
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,400
literally when it comes to the

1386
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,719
the genetics of it everything is exactly

1387
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,720
the same besides

1388
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:18,719
being able to reverse that's literally

1389
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:21,199
the only thing that's different um even

1390
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:23,519
when we come down to clowning um you can

1391
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:25,838
you can clone a puppy especially uh

1392
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:28,239
nowadays that's why eventually we'll

1393
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:28,960
we're evolving into the tissue culture

1394
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:30,959
and

1395
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,559
people clone puppies using titu culture

1396
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,318
and you know

1397
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:36,000
through our gardening we'll eventually

1398
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:38,639
start to see people

1399
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,719
preferably creating their clones through

1400
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:43,279
tissue culture because you can store it

1401
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:44,799
for much longer um it's that much

1402
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,800
similar to where

1403
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,039
there's only literally one

1404
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,720
um difference as far as that that i can

1405
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:52,639
tell reversing being able to reverse a

1406
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:53,919
female i don't really know anything else

1407
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,920
that's different

1408
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,880
x y chromosomes everything's literally

1409
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,639
the same um even some of the terminology

1410
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,318
um that i learned

1411
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:05,039
years ago through

1412
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:08,159
you know it connected and i'm like wow

1413
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:10,400
okay like hybrid vigor and it is a

1414
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:13,199
different term in the dog world but it

1415
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,960
means sort of the same thing um in the

1416
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:16,639
plant world that's interesting yeah i

1417
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,480
was just curious on that one so i have a

1418
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:20,000
few more questions for you

1419
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,559
what advice do you have for someone

1420
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,838
who's a beginner breeder or someone who

1421
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,800
is considering starting to

1422
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:29,199
breed have fun man

1423
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,599

00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,559
understand that uh

1426
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,119
you definitely are gonna have to have a

1427

passion for it uh you gotta have a love

1428

quite a bit here and i thought it was

00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:57,920
pretty pretty interesting here about the

1466
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:01,359
crossover with the dog breeding as well

1467
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:03,119
and we got deep into some things that i

1468
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:05,279
wasn't expecting to get that deep into

1469
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,920
so i'm really glad that i had you on the

1470
