system 1100 LED grow light in two of my

8
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:15,838
past grows I was very satisfied with the

9
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,980
results I got from using that light and

10
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,570
California light works decided to

11
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,640
sponsor this video and send me over

12
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,410
their new light the solar extreme 500 in

13
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,368
this video we're gonna unboxing it and

14
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,219
we'll also talk about some of the

15
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:34,240
features

16
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:34,239

20
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,770
this'll extreme 500 is a full-spectrum

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,390
LED grow light designed especially for

22
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:15,670
grow tents and small-scale home growing

23
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,890
I measure the unit and then mentions our

24
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,960
nineteen point two five inches by nine

25
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,629
inches by four inches and the fixture

26
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:24,309
weighs 11 pounds this LED realize good

27
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:25,959
for all stages of the growing from

28
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,790
seedling through flowering it has a

29
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,929
coverage area of full foot by four foot

30
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,730
when the plants are in the flowering

31
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,460
stage and five foot by five foot when

32
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,450
the plants are in the vegetation stage

33
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,589
simplicity is one word that I'd use to

34
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,079
describe this light

35
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,760
there's no switches knobs or dimmer to

36
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,649
make adjustments you simply hang the

37
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,359
light using the supplied hooks in your

38
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,340
choice of light hangers and then plug

39
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,829
the unit into the wall the girl light

40
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,500
consists of eight high efficient cob

41
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:52,599
LEDs and uses new direct AC drive

42
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,060
technology which eliminates a need for a

43
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:56,978
Cepheid LED driver this combination

44
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,990
results in not only less energy draw it

45
00:01:56,978 --> 00:02:00,519
consumes only 400 watts but it also

46
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:02,439
allows the unit to be sold at a much

47
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:04,750
lower cost and other LEDs that have the

48
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:06,849
same coverage area now let's talk about

49
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,770
power output California light work lists

50
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:10,719
a few different ppfd measurements for

51
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,270
this LED grow light when the grow light

52
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,370
is hanging a distance of 18 inches ppfd

53
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,250
is 800 when the light is hanging at a

54
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,739
distance of 24 inches ppfd comes in at

55
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,209
500 on the screen right now is the light

56
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:24,280
spectrum emitted from the scroll light

57
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:26,769
California light works causes the solar

58
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,370
extreme up to grow full-spectrum the

59
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:31,810
fixture uses 3.3 amps at 124 thermal

60
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,000
management this unit has a large

61
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,819
aluminum heatsink and two active cooling

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,139
fans the way they work is air will come

63
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:40,389
in through the top of the fixture and

64
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:43,529
then blow out of the sides the heat

65
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:45,669
output on this unit is 1280 BTU

66
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,349
California light works borns that all of

67
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:49,359
