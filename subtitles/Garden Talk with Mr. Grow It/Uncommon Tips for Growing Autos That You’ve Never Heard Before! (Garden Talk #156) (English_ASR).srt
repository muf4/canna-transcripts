100
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:43,919
great uh starting growing I've been

101
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:46,598
around since I was 13 I mean I I mean

102
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,798
you know the the med medicinal plant

103
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:52,199
that we all love and and and uh talk

104
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:56,560
about all the time and uh I didn't start

105
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:59,280
gardening uh till about 5 years ago um

106
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,878
my wife of would have been 29 years a

107
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,598
couple days ago uh passed away about 3

108
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,280
years ago from

109
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:10,318
leukemia and so I quickly became a

110
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,079
single dad of two kids two young guys

111
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,199
and uh now they're older which is great

112
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,720
and

113
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:19,599
uh she was a school teacher

114
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,759
so gardening wasn't very easy for me

115
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,160
before

116
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:27,080
then um and

117
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,039
once it became uh legal to Garden in

118
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:31,680
your own

119
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:33,959
house uh I was cool and she was cool so

120
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,319
I started and I started the first run I

121
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,839
ever did was OT

122
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,800
flowers and I had no clue what I was

123
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:46,599
doing I had a blurle light a 4x4 tent

124
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:51,160
from China uh had no clue about anything

125
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:55,199
just I had two friends Jake and Jay that

126
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,240
um have been gardening a long time and

127
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,478
they took me under their wing and they

128
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,560
showed me quite a bit and I owe them a

129
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:05,918
lot and and uh shout out to them they're

130
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:09,399
out in Maine now and uh I started going

131
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:11,478
and I just did everything trial by error

132
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:14,519
and you know I it

133
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:18,038
was hard at first then I started to

134
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:20,839
really understand the plant after a few

135
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:23,719
runs I tried my hand at some photos they

136
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:25,519
did very well did some scrogging so

137
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,520
trying to grow all different ways at

138
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:31,000
that time I was using soil uh soam

139
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:32,839
actually uh but I just I hated the

140
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,120
fungus Nets they just kept showing up

141
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:36,399
all the

142
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,120
time

143
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:41,679
and I started digging deeper into

144
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,240
YouTube and looking for other ways to

145
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,918
grow Autos looking the ways to grow big

146
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,879
Autos the first Auto I grew believe it

147
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:50,079
or not was 4 and a half oun it was a

148
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,680
good siiz plant for the first

149
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,359
time and at that time that was a while

150
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,800
ago there were people saying oh I got a

151
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,319
you know tiny plant whatever and it

152
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,840
really got a bad

153
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,879
reputation so so I decided I was going

154
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:08,279
to dig into it more and I did and uh

155
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:12,240
came up with a different style that most

156
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:15,758
uh kind of a mishmash of commercial and

157
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,160
homow and boom I harvested this year I

158
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,319
harvested three Autos over one pound in

159
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,360
a

160
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:25,360
row and I said who I got something

161
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:29,038
here and it's led

162
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,400
to where we at now just growing autos

163
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,000
and

164
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,799
trying all different types of genetics

165
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,319
trying all different types of feeding

166
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,199
types and schedules and light schedules

167
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,879
and that's where the Mad sciences came

168
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,759
from because I'm one of those people

169
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,240
that can never leave anything alone and

170
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:47,160
I always think there's a better way so

171
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,319
in doing that being an outside the box

172
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,800
thinker I've I've tried all kinds of

173
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,840
stuff people would laugh at me and say

174
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,280
are you crazy and then they would look

175
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:58,439
at the plant and say I guess you not

176
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,359
crazy that's kind of how I got started

177
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:03,000
that's awesome yeah I know Massachusetts

178
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,000
legalized back in 2016 if I remember

179
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,759
correctly wck it was the same year that

180
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Nevada did it and that's where yeah I

181
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,038
currently live right now and I remember

182
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,720
I was like so pumped up back in the day

183
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,120
when that actually happened and there

184
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,400
have been so many amazing Growers coming

185
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,038
out of Massachusetts and it really is a

186
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:20,519
pretty decent climate to live in you

187
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,000
know I mean as far as like the humidity

188
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,680
and stuff like that and Outdoors it

189
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,879
thrives you know during the summertime

190
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,160
and yeah there really good stuff coming

191
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,919
coming out of mass and Autos Outdoors do

192
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,360
great cuz you can plant them in April

193
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,758
and they're done the end of June or

194
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,160
early July and then you can get another

195
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,960
run in before October you can do two

196
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,039
runs and you do all right that's awesome

197
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,598
is that why you prefer Autos over photos

198
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,918
or there other reasons for that as well

199
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,519
I'm an underdog guy I've always rooted

200
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:53,758
for the underdog you know what I mean

201
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:56,079
and I just kept doing my research on

202
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,520
autoflowers and they got such a bad rap

203
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,158
and it was like oh everybody kept going

204
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,560
back to the old days with low rider and

205
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:03,079
it was you know you got an ounce if you

206
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,720
were lucky it was 8% D whatever it was

207
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:10,918
and uh I was determined to do better um

208
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,919
the best one I've had tested in so far

209
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:17,639
was um uh brother mandell's

210
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:19,680
Mota I grew that last summer four of

211
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:23,280
them in a 4x4 you guys actually showed

212
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,800
it on uh show your stash and that's when

213
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,519
I got kind of introduced to you guys

214
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,478
that way cuz Rob was like those are

215
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,598
autos and I'm like yeah they're Autos

216
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,360
bro and and I that was one light it

217
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,799
wasn't even my my new light it was an

218
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,440
hlg light uh and that was 2.2 lbs of

219
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:43,278
Autos in a 4x4 on one

220
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:47,279
light and I had that tested and it was

221
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:49,720
28% THC it had 2.5% turps it's pretty

222
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,639
damn good and I said if Autos can do

223
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,839
that why would I grow anything else I

224
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:56,879
can be done with Autos I can do two runs

225
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,160
a year and relax the rest of the time

226
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,320
and breed cuz that's my goal is to breed

227
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:03,519
so I have little projects going you know

228
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,959
yeah Autos have changed so much over the

229
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,560
years I mean when I first started

230
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,719
growing back in 2010 like you kind of

231
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:12,599
mentioned is like it has a bad rep right

232
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,839
it's like low rider was like the what

233
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,159
everybody kind of talked about and it's

234
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,120
just gotten better and better and better

235
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:22,199
over the years and now I mean you can

236
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,879
grow massive Autoflower plants great

237
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,440
quality and uh yeah it's hard to say

238
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,399
that's an auto and that's a photo like

239
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,959
trying to you know say which is which

240
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,159
it's like it's hard to tell the

241
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:34,159
difference these days I've done the

242
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:35,039
taste test with friends r two one photo

243
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,240
One

244
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:40,838
auto tell me the

245
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,360
difference right so when you're growing

246
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,959
these Autos what is your kind of overall

247
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,120
gross style are you growing both indoors

248
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:50,078
and Outdoors are you in I think you

249
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,120
mentioned you're done with soil so is it

250
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:54,838
cocoa that you're in and then what about

251
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,679
like organic or synthetic or what

252
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,440
Outdoors when I when I do grow outdoors

253
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,919
in the spring and the summer it's it's

254
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,720
soil I have a soil this this would be

255
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:05,559
the third year so I just re amend it and

256
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,000
get it going and that's that's a pretty

257
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:12,479
organic it's I would say a Sanic

258
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,720
grow uh in my uh grow area is in the

259
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,480
basement and I have a a 5x5 a 4x4 and a

260
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,278
2x3 and the 4x4 has got holes all over

261
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,240
the place I just use it for drying and

262
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,600
it works great uh the 55 is a new AC

263
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,639
Infinity I got for myself that was my

264
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,759
Christmas present last year to myself

265
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:31,679
great please I love the I love the but

266
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,278
getting used to a 4x4 to a 5x5 is

267
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:37,319
different a lot more space so it took a

268
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:41,519
little bit but I um I got it going and

269
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:44,720
now I my style is very different so I

270
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,720
use stacked rock

271
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,839
wall I start out with a little rock wool

272
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,440
pellet and that's where I put the pop

273
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,880
seed in and that goes into either a 4 in

274
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,680
on the that I'm going to use or a six

275
00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:00,360
inch I've moved over to the six inch I

276
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:03,000
put that in and I will feed I will hand

277
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,759
feed that twice a day 2 and a half

278
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,320
ounces for the whole time it's a it's a

279
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:12,919
Seedling as soon as it gets its second

280
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,040
um set of

281
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:18,360
leaves I will go

282
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:20,879
to 4

283
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,278
oz and then as soon as the roots break

284
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:26,039
through it will go on top of an 8 in

285
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:28,639
Mama they call it Big Mama and I put

286
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,639
them on risers inside of the water

287
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,159
catching uh

288
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,480
uh circles there I foret what they're

289
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:37,679
called so it builds a little stack so

290
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,800
you'll have the you'll have the the

291
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,958
water catcher the Riser the 8 in the

292
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:45,359
four or the 6 in and the plant will

293
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:48,159
start to grow through now usually it'll

294
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,919
take about four weeks and it's already

295
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,159
coming through the bottom of the 8 in

296
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,639
that's how fast those roots grow so I

297
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,199
trim them at an angle so that they're

298
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:57,519
not dangling anything uh and I stay on

299
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,800
top of the trimming of those so that

300
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:04,360
they St they can it's always New Growth

301
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:06,919
one of the things that I do that is new

302
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,360
to the game is my light has separate far

303
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:13,479
red 730

304
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,879
neter so from seedling until second week

305
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,560
of flower that's on

306
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:23,198
100% And what that does is it stretches

307
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:24,319
the plant so with Autos if you don't hit

308
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:26,919
right

309
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,879
away immediately they don't start to

310
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:30,679
grow and they're not healthy right away

311
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:34,559
Al St o cuz you're going to get a

312
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:37,879
miniature plant okay the way I'm doing

313
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:40,638
it doesn't happen that way because using

314
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:43,919
the far red will kick them into

315
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,519
overdrive to stretch quickly so you'll

316
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,599
you'll get your big plant stop moving

317
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,759
and moving and

318
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,560
moving and then once you kick it down

319
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:51,759
I'll kick it down to 40% the rest of the

320
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,278
way until the end of flower and then

321
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:54,759
I'll crank it up because it's great for

322
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:59,360
uh chlorophyll and photosynthesis and

323
00:12:54,759 --> 00:13:01,838
all that stuff it does add more leafage

324
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,879
you'll get a lot of you'll get big big

325
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,399
big big satellite leaves I've had them

326
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:08,120
bigger than both my hands put together

327
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,720
and as long as you stay on top of those

328
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,000
and and give you middle some space I

329
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,920
don't do any

330
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,919
topping I don't do any LST which

331
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:19,039
everybody's like huh I don't me and

332
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:22,719
pigeons are the total

333
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:24,799
opposite and uh but I do leaf tucking

334
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,920
and I sto that

335
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:29,439
immediately so once I sto the leaf

336
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:31,479
tucking and the stretching now those

337
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,440
plants are eating in turbo mode cuz

338
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,320
they're autof flowers if you look at a

339
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,639
photo in an Autoflower a photo you can

340
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,480
keep in veg as long as you want you can

341
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:41,519
limit your feeding and the plant will

342
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,199
steadily grow until it maxes out

343
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,519
basically and you can flip it or

344
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,679
whatever you want to do or you can flip

345
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,399
it right away some people I know

346
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:52,159
flipping it in flower one

347
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:54,559
week but Autos are kind of like I kind

348
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:57,719
of call

349
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:00,198
them plants on steroids kind of because

350
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:04,079
you've got to feed them like they're

351
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:05,359
growing because they grow so fast so as

352
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:09,679
soon as they're out of seeding stain I'm

353
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,360
in 100% speed mode they're at 2.3

354
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,359
EC and as soon as they get to fla

355
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,360
they're at 3 EC and they stay that way

356
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:20,320
all the way

357
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:23,079
through um and I can tell in three weeks

358
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,320
if I have a good plant enough and if I

359
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:27,719
don't I'll kill it call it without a new

360
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,800
one and I try to keep it Perpetual so

361
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,399
that once I'm in I two or three weeks

362
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:34,359
away from Harvest I'll stop my new beans

363
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:36,440
in the corner of the tent let them go

364
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,120
get them Rising feeding them and it's a

365
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:43,639
lot because I don't use an auto feeder

366
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:46,639
so uh I feed by hand twice a day once in

367
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:50,639
the early early late morning and once

368
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,480
around 11: at night and I set my then

369
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,240
I'm sure you're going to want to know

370
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,800
about light schedule a little bit so

371
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,240
I'll go right into that for

372
00:14:54,799 --> 00:15:00,599
you my light schedule's crazy and it's

373
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,639
because I've tried so many ways to see

374
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,040
what I can coax out of the

375
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,360
plant so what I've settled down on and

376
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:07,439
what I've been using now for about a

377
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,079
year

378
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,560
is deeding into the second week of edge

379
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:15,719
is 24

380
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:19,319
hours second week of edge

381
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,680
into uh I would say two weeks before

382
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,600
Harvest I am at

383
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:27,679
186 and then the next three weeks until

384
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:31,159
they're done I'm at 24 so 20 and four so

385
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,239
20 on four off and I find that the 20

386
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:34,480
and

387
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,399
four um when you're giving them a ton of

388
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,959
DLI and ppfd that's when those the the

389
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,958
Nuggets really Hoten they really get

390
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:46,000
strong and and throw a lot of a lot a

391
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:49,318
lot of uh of smell and and and and uh

392
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,240
tricomes so I've that's all by trial and

393
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:54,159
error and once I got it down and these

394
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,919
last three plants that I had harvested

395
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:58,639
came through like they did I said I've

396
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,159
got something here cuz there were three

397
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,639
different genetics by three different

398
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:04,120
breeders so there wasn't a coincidence I

399
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,399
did it that way on

400
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,919
purpose you know what I mean but that's

401
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:13,360
so when I

402
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:15,759
feed I feed to runoff every time so once

403
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,079
they start to run off I'm done and I

404
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,480
move on to the next Plant and right now

405
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:24,120
like I have a grow

406
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,480
going uh they are in week well they're

407
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,560
in day

408
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:31,680
45 and I'm they're already taking over

409
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,679
50 00 MERS twice a day and some people

410
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,359
would use, 1500 Millers maybe once or

411
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,120
twice a week with

412
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,278
Autos that doesn't get them to to fly

413
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,759
now Auto Parts help because they take

414
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:44,439
what they want but you're not in control

415
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,800
they

416
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,880
are this way I'm in complete control of

417
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:52,159
the plant I can crop steer it any way I

418
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:54,360
want that's where the scientist stuff

419
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,240
came from because it's it's playing

420
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,399
around and finding the right thing

421
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,919
because it's not your average plant you

422
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,039
definitely have a unique style when it

423
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,078
comes to the growing the Autos

424
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:05,480
particularly with like the light

425
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,918
schedule and I don't really hear about a

426
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,679
lot of people growing Autos in Rockwall

427
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,839
for example so kind of to back up a

428
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,919
minute here you kind of talked about

429
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:20,599
what you do for an EC what nutrient

430
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:22,720
lineup are you using I ran Jax 123 for a

431
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:26,078
while and I really liked it it's a

432
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:29,160
powder uh has an a&amp; B and then uh use

433
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:31,240
EPs and salt uh to go along with it to

434
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,320
take care of the

435
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,640
cowap and I liked it a lot I I've done

436
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,639
some really good grows with it but I

437
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,200
found that the turps weren't as good as

438
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,600
I wanted them to

439
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:46,120
be and I would steer it a lot I'd add a

440
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:49,000
lot of inputs change it up and it would

441
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:50,319
be okay it' be good it' have effects but

442
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,679
it this just wouldn't have the flavor I

443
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:55,158
was looking for so I've did some

444
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,320
research and this run I'm for the first

445
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,440
time I'm I'm I'm trying cronic

446
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:00,960
noes and I had to adjust to them a

447
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,759
little bit because I think they feed a

448
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,159
little light he has um he has the

449
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:09,158
Autoflower uh specific the Bonnie and

450
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:12,000
Clyde to go along with his line there uh

451
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:14,520
I know he's a friend of uh one of the

452
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,919
other YouTuber guys Joe matter of fact I

453
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:20,400
think Luke who won the throw-off thing

454
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:23,400
there I think he uses FR NES um and I

455
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,880
find it it's it's good I so far so good

456
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,080
I just had to up the amount cuz e

457
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,280
wouldn't come close to where I wanted to

458
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:33,480
be so like if they said start out with 4

459
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:35,918
m per gallon I'm doing

460
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,798
five cuz I want my EC to be where I want

461
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:42,840
it to be I know what the what the plant

462
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:45,798
can uptake um I have a friend uh we're

463
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:48,798
pretty tight he um he owns speedrun

464
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:50,759
seeds his name is Ben cotch they have

465
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:53,720
some of the best Autoflower seeds I've

466
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:54,440
ever come across amazing stuff very very

467
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,038
good

468
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,640
quality and he's an

469
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:02,919
agronomist so he help me figure out a

470
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,280
basis on the on the uh on the feeding

471
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:07,640
that would work best for Autos cuz he's

472
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:09,000
grown 300,000 of them so kind of got a

473
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,240
little Advantage there learning that

474
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,038
stuff because from an agronomist because

475
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,759
I couldn't figure that stuff out on my

476
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:17,319
own with those EC's that you mentioned

477
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:21,759
that you were running you said 2.3 EC in

478
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:22,879
seedling 3.0 EC when you're in flowering

479
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:24,720
I think that's going to come as a

480
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,080
surprise to quite a few folks that are

481
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,400
listening in cuz I want to do the

482
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:33,240
conversion here I got a conversion sh up

483
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:37,720
two .3 EC is 1,150 PPM on a 500 scale

484
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:39,919
PPM meter and then the 3.0 EC is at 1500

485
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,159
PPM which is about a lot of people are

486
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,880
reaching for that in flowering but you

487
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:46,640
hear about autoflowers being more of a

488
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,919
light feeder would you say that's a

489
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:54,000
misconception I would there's a reason

490
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,360
like uh Lynn autopot him and I talk and

491
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,960
like he said sometimes he'll have to

492
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,719
fill those Reservoir twice a week

493
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,240
because they're uptaking what they want

494
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,960
but they take a lot to get an autoflow

495
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,159
to go from its normal four to 5 ounces

496
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,880
or whatever to get it to 19 20 ounces

497
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:12,640
you've got to feed it you know you see a

498
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,240
6 fo3 kid in e8th grade he's not eating

499
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,559
fruits and vegetables all the time you

500
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,440
know what I mean he's eating I mean it's

501
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:21,720
the same growth system it's just it's a

502
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,519
plant um I've always looked at autof

503
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,440
flowers as you got to get just as much

504
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:29,720
food into an autoflow in half the time

505
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,080
as a photo period

506
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:35,240
and you got to do it one way or the

507
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:37,599
other and honestly with Rockwell you

508
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,519
can't overwater you can give it as much

509
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:42,558
as you want it just drains right out and

510
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,918
it has roal has tons of air in it and my

511
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:47,359
that's something I left out I I'll put

512
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,880
in uh I I mix 20 gallons at a

513
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:53,158
time uh in a in a

514
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:56,120
reservoir and I have two airstones in it

515
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:58,600
so for 15 minutes before I feed I'll go

516
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:01,239
down there turn the airstones on mix it

517
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:04,158
let it go get bubbles going I always oxy

518
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,839
oxygenate my food and my watering

519
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:10,400
because that creates more air the more

520
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:13,158
air you get to the roots of an autoflow

521
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,278
the faster and more rapid it will grow

522
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:17,559
because an autoflow is a little

523
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:19,960
different than a photo when it comes to

524
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:22,599
expanding Roots an autoflow wants to

525
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,600
grow straight down right away then it

526
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:26,918
will Branch out and that's what happens

527
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:30,719
with a lot of guys when they go to to tr

528
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:33,080
transfer from like say a solo cup to a a

529
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,079
five gal or a three gal with an

530
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:36,678
Autoflower you have to do that within

531
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:38,599
the first seven to eight days of its

532
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:40,798
life if you get to the point where that

533
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:43,399
root is around the bottom it's too late

534
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:45,798
to start over it won't

535
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:49,320
grow and that's done I've done it a

536
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:51,440
bunch of times and it won't grow it'll

537
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:52,839
grow I mean it'll be this big and it'll

538
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,720
be that big and it's not something you

539
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:57,240
want to waste all that food and time on

540
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,240
now if you can get it so it grows

541
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,480
straight down it doesn't stop

542
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,038
and start watering the sides around the

543
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,400
6in block on the 8 in block now they

544
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:08,480
start to come back up again and they

545
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,320
swirl around the inside of the rock rock

546
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,200
wall I've broken them open after they're

547
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,918
done and the amount of roots is insane

548
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,440
but it it it it covers everything in

549
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:19,200
there there's so much room in there for

550
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,320
it to grow uh and it just allows it to

551
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,640
keep growing and growing you know bigger

552
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:26,678
Roots bigger fruits yeah I in my

553
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,200
experience same deal I've started Autos

554
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,720
in the Solo cups and once that route

555
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,480
hits the bottom starts circling around

556
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,880
you know even if you transplant at that

557
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,679
point I've always had like just Autos

558
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,559
that were I say stunted but yeah they

559
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,360
flower pretty quickly like a little bit

560
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:44,759
quicker than they really should I think

561
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:47,240
that's why you hear a lot of people be

562
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:49,119
big proponents of planting autoflowers

563
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:53,880
in their final container not

564
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:55,558
transplanting at all I agree um although

565
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,799
you know my friend Ben from speedrun

566
00:22:55,558 --> 00:23:00,079
would say I trans I I I I transfer pots

567
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:02,918
all the time but he knows what he's

568
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:04,439
doing like he's grown 300,000 Autos in

569
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:06,559
his life you know what I mean he has a

570
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,240
huge farm with Autos everywhere I'm like

571
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,038
I can't do that he's like you got to do

572
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,278
a feno hunt I'm like yeah I can probably

573
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:14,119
do like four you know what I mean pick

574
00:23:12,278 --> 00:23:16,159
the best out of the four I'm going to be

575
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:18,879
very small with that

576
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,840
stuff I learned some of this from

577
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,159
another guy on YouTube years ago and

578
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:24,720
he's disappeared and I'm I'm I'm it's

579
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:26,960
it's bad to just be he was a really good

580
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,360
guy and was some high guy have you ever

581
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,360
seen him he started growing in the rock

582
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:35,079
wall he used to do Coco Corp and he's

583
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:37,918
grew some big autles and people were on

584
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:40,038
to him he's from Washington State and he

585
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:45,360
grew a Dr

586
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:48,519
cley's um incredible bulk to 2.7 pounds

587
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:51,158
live on air like it the whole grow was

588
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:53,119
live he did a a vlog every week and and

589
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:54,520
and put it on YouTube that the biggest

590
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,759
Autoflower I ever seen my goal is to

591
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:58,480
beat it I would love to beat that yeah

592
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:01,558
I've heard of the incredible bulk before

593
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,839
or uh I think it was ugliest medicinal

594
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:06,119
plant you've ever

595
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:08,038
seen but um he claimed it was phenomenal

596
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:09,239
smoke guy named girl pot chapley I don't

597
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:11,919
know if you've ever heard of him I know

598
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,240
him y he way back in the day incredible

599
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,000
bulk yeah I remember seeing his and this

600
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,839
big big plant huge buds on it just

601
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,880
everywhere kind of hard to manage but

602
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:22,639
big big

603
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,760
yielder the high orbit I just ran that I

604
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,399
harvested uh six months

605
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:30,480
ago that was from Mendel brothers and uh

606
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:31,759
I was an Inda but she grew I couldn't

607
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,200
stop her from growing and she didn't

608
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:34,759
have a lot of leaves it was crazy there

609
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,360
was I didn't have to do any stripping or

610
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:39,640
anything really couple leaves here and

611
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:43,119
there and I had just single buds on that

612
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:46,360
five 6 Ines long they were huge and that

613
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:49,359
ended up being uh like 19 12 ounz

614
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:52,079
plant I mean the base on it Chris was

615
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:54,639
like this it was huge so I do use I

616
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:57,240
forgot I do use Silica through the

617
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,559
entire grow at a low rate and it's the

618
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,599
first thing that's mixed

619
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:04,278
and when I I should say this too when I

620
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,839
mix my nutrients um I just just pour it

621
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:08,359
in the water I have little intell lab uh

622
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,558
scientific little thingy there you put

623
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:12,000
the jar on top with your nutrients in

624
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:13,359
your water and you put the little bar on

625
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,440
the bottom and you hit the button and it

626
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,678
it mixes it for you so I'll let

627
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,798
everything mix for like a minute minute

628
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:20,120
and a half before I add it to the

629
00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:21,079
reservoir and I have a sequence okay

630
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:24,278
yeah I was going to ask you if you're

631
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:26,199
using any additives on top of the Croc

632
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:28,319
nutrients so is it just silica that

633
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,278
you're using or using other additives

634
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,519
use their whole line right now which is

635
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:34,159
um the armadillo which is the silica

636
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:39,158
they have the Bonnie and Clyde which is

637
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:40,679
the uh the veg and Bloom they have a uh

638
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:44,679
monkey Bandit I think it's called and

639
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:46,679
that's for like uh flavor and stickiness

640
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:48,840
and stuff like that uh so they have a

641
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:52,360
nice little lineup there uh and they I

642
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:53,879
used their calac but I also use uh

643
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:58,359
flavor

644
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:00,640
from from George and uh but it's so d

645
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:03,000
expensive I buy the little 4 o bottle

646
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,399
and that usually fills a whole 20 gals

647
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,159
so I have to buy it every couple weeks

648
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:09,639
or so but I only I run it three times

649
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:12,000
maybe I'll run a whole bottle in three

650
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,679
different mixes and then I let it go and

651
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,240
then then in the end I do use flower

652
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:19,360
stacker which is one of my favorite

653
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,200
things from Humble secret I just I love

654
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:24,558
that it's always worked phenomenal for

655
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:30,240
me uh so I use that and I

656
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:30,240
alternate um I alternate sugery

657
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:33,919
from

658
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,480
uh what the hell's I can't remember the

659
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,919
name of the company and I run um

660
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,319
honeycomb from uh Cali so I'll

661
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,720
interchange them one week I'll run

662
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:43,879
sugary one week I'll run honeycomb they

663
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,640
kind of do the same thing but a little

664
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:51,440
bit different and using that

665
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:54,038
Trifecta little by little has now helped

666
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,840
the turps get to where I want them to be

667
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:59,000
in my plants so i' I've massed getting

668
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:01,959
them large I'm not going to grow a pound

669
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,398
plant every time but I look at is if I

670
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,519
can get two pounds of light I'm

671
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:10,519
happy you know what I mean but at the

672
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:13,359
same time I want flavorful stuff so and

673
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:15,440
using those inputs back and forth

674
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,879
changing them up plant doesn't get used

675
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,798
to it and it doesn't start to taste just

676
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,080
like that

677
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,359
input that's kind of the little I just

678
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,398
came up though myself just messing

679
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:28,599
around with a few grows and the last run

680
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:32,839
I did the pound dog and the trisket in

681
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:34,558
the um High orbit uh all were over a

682
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:37,240
pound and they all were very

683
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,960
flavorful I don't use jars I do use

684
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,919
Grove bags I've been using Grove bags

685
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,600
since they came out um and I'll let them

686
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:47,000
cure I'll do a dry see my house dries

687
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,678
fast it's weird I even have them in

688
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,359
their own tent I have a fan in there and

689
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,640
all that stuff and it stays right around

690
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:57,639
between 55 and 62 on both you know what

691
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,000
I mean stays right in that area usually

692
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,600
it's about 88 days and they're ready and

693
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,519
I have a moisture meter I'll go in and

694
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:05,439
hit different buds from different parts

695
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:08,679
and it'll tell me if it's under 12% I'm

696
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,960
pulling it and uh and then I will let it

697
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:12,120
cure for 21 to 25 days depending on what

698
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,120
I think is

699
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:17,239
right that's it okay so you are using

700
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,000
the cron nutrients base and then

701
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,440
additives and I looked it up sugary is

702
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,880
by cutting in Solutions yes cutting in

703
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,278
Solutions yep I like them that's

704
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,640
actually a pharmaceutical grade you can

705
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:29,398
actually food grade you can actually

706
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:33,559
drink that

707
00:28:29,398 --> 00:28:36,079
I would never do it I say have you done

708
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:38,839
it but it's uh it actually does a nice

709
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,158
job my my um my local Hydro shop guy

710
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:41,678
turned me on to that he says I use it in

711
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,880
every one of my grows I'll give it a

712
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,278
world and I did a couple of runs with I

713
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:49,519
really liked it so it's here to

714
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:51,558
stay once something's here to stay I'm

715
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:55,319
not messing it up you

716
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:57,240
know I do like the Tinker I change a lot

717
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:58,879
about how much I use and stuff like that

718
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:03,120
to see if there's a difference

719
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,360
and I I do use the the F red to uh to do

720
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:06,839
a lot of changing the crop a lot of

721
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,199
people call it crop steering I just call

722
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:11,079
it changing the crop you know I I I'm

723
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,759
not going to I'm not going to Mainline

724
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:14,278
in Auto you know what I mean you're

725
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:16,398
Mainline in Auto you're going to get

726
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:17,398
like six little buds about this big and

727
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:19,518
it's a

728
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:22,319
wrap um I'm going to leave them alone

729
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,079
and that's the key is let them grow you

730
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:25,200
know everybody wants to touch it I got

731
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:28,278
to pull this off I got to strip the

732
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,000
bottom and all that it's an autoflow

733
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:31,880
you've got to allow it to mature as

734
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,599
quick as it possibly can and grow as

735
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,200
much as it possibly can before you start

736
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,240
doing all that stuff or you'll stunt it

737
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,278
and if you stunt and it's you might as

738
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,640
well start over I have done it I've got

739
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:44,319
three beautiful ones in there right now

740
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,440
and one that I messed up and she don't

741
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:48,720
like me right now that's okay she's

742
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,278
three weeks into flower I'm not going to

743
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,480
kill her now just taking what she is but

744
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:55,759
if that happened in the second week or

745
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:59,000
the third week I would have restarted

746
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:00,599
and I do use the the paper method Yeah

747
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,038
you mentioned you're very hands off when

748
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:05,558
it comes to training no topping or LST

749
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,919
or just doing Leaf tucking that's

750
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:09,678
another thing that a lot of people talk

751
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:11,919
about is that they say that topping the

752
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,798
plant utof flowers in particular

753
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,600
significantly can stunt its growth and

754
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:18,839
therefore flip the flower and you just

755
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:20,439
got this small yielding plant would you

756
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:22,439
agree with that or disagree with that I

757
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,600
do agree you have to hit them ex exact

758
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,960
if you want to top Autos you got to do

759
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:29,119
it in the right time frame same thing as

760
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,399
transplanting you know you got to as

761
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:34,759
soon as they get to the third node or

762
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:36,479
fourth node you better top quick and

763
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:40,038
make sure they've grown some before you

764
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,880
do it if they're not 6 in tall

765
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:44,398
already if you do it they're going to

766
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,679
stay 6 Ines tall or they'll grow a

767
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,518
little bit and you'll get a couple extra

768
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:51,120
tops but if you leave tuck it does the

769
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:52,759
same exact thing without interfering

770
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,678
with the plants

771
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:57,759
grow cuz you like Zaza says all the time

772
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,840
the first thing you look for is Vigor

773
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,679
well and Autoflower that can't be a true

774
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:04,678
or statement you want Vigor you want

775
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:08,000
something that takes off like a like a

776
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:09,798
dot goes you know and that's when you'll

777
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,359
start saying oh boy I got a big girl on

778
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:12,839
my hands and you don't want to slow down

779
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:14,079
the growth at all so you know you cric

780
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:16,519
me from wrong you're not doing any

781
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:18,319
lollipopping or what about defoliation

782
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:21,200
are you pulling leaves off at all or

783
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:24,119
just talk I'll take five to six leaves a

784
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,480
two times a day okay so I can keep the

785
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:29,518
the the the top open the middle clear um

786
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,558
I do

787
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,200
usually right when they start to turn

788
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:35,079
into little flowers little buds free

789
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,159
flow that's when I'll do some lollipop

790
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:38,879
on the bottom make sure it's kind of

791
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,919
clear uh but the Autos that I grow grow

792
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,440
really fast so there's usually about

793
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:43,559
that much on the bottom of stem with

794
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,240
nothing on

795
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:50,638
it and my plans are to um I'm just

796
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:53,599
waiting till they come in to stock uh as

797
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:56,798
I'm getting the under canopy lighting um

798
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:58,359
cuz why waste any part of the plant if

799
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:59,918
you can get a buds on the bottom and a

800
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:01,918
buds on the top and you can cut your

801
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,799
lights that's a lot of people say oh

802
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,240
it's too much light no no the way it's

803
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:07,599
done is you take your main light and you

804
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,359
cut the power to half of what you

805
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,959
normally would use because you don't

806
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,240
need to use it because you've got you do

807
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,600
the same thing with the under under

808
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,359
canopy when you do that coinciding with

809
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,638
each other you got a plant that's giving

810
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:20,038
you a buds all the way up from the top

811
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:23,199
to the bottom it's going to change the

812
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:25,599
growing style for all I mean between

813
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,360
everything ACI is coming up with and

814
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:29,359
their their awesome Ai and all that

815
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:30,599
stuff the come up with and these lights

816
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:31,959
that are doing things that people have

817
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:34,678
never seen

818
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,759
before the home grower is going to make

819
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:39,519
is going to do real well it's going to

820
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:42,759
get it's going to make it simple for

821
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,720
everybody now it is kind of cheating but

822
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:46,480
that's

823
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,278
okay don't cheat you don't

824
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,399
win it's definitely a lot more hands-off

825
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:55,240
a lot more automated I mean I've been

826
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:57,719
using their controller 69z 69 Pro now

827
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,720
I'm on the AI controller and yeah it

828
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,759
just just gets more and more hands off

829
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,038
when it comes to having the controls and

830
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:06,798
with the AI thing you don't even need to

831
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:09,119
do the individual components the

832
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:10,720
criteria for each individual component

833
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:12,959
you just press the start button and it

834
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,679
goes you know just say it's in seedling

835
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,880
or you say it's in uh flowering and it

836
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:18,320
just goes now the jury still out whether

837
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,519
how well that worked compared to

838
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:22,720
manually doing it but yeah I think over

839
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:24,880
time the machine learning I think it

840
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,839
should hopefully fingers cross that it

841
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,080
evolves to where it is truly making the

842
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:32,480
best decisions you know whether it comes

843
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:34,439
to bringing the air in turning on

844
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,960
humidifier turning off the deif fire

845
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,880
whatever components you have within the

846
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,278
grow I I see that they have an

847
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:43,039
autoflowering um one that you can choose

848
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:44,599
too that on the menu yes now I got a

849
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:47,278
chance I got a I'm going to have to play

850
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:48,959
with that when I get one because will

851
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:51,759
that give me the light that I want will

852
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,159
that give me you know what I mean will

853
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:54,079
that work the way I want it to work to

854
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:56,360
do what I

855
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:58,359
do or would I have to override some

856
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:02,839
stuff to to customize it the way I want

857
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:05,319
to it cuz the lighting that I use is

858
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:07,959
strong and a lot of people will say

859
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:11,159
you're not burning the tops I've never

860
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:13,800
had burnt tops because you just have to

861
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:17,039
you have to play with the light but I I

862
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:20,119
finished my last run and the and the

863
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:22,159
ppfd on my canopy was

864
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:25,399
1350 and that was only the light was

865
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,559
only at 85% and it was 30 in off the

866
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:30,118
canopy now once they grow humongous is I

867
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:33,039
have to do it a little closer so I'll

868
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:35,440
turn it down a little bit but uh the DLI

869
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:38,279
I try to shoot for 40 every day I want

870
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,280
Max Di and people don't realize they say

871
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,040
oh that's a lot you go outside and grow

872
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,480
outside the sun's natural ppfd at 2

873
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:47,480
o'clock in the afternoon is like

874
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,960
2,300 what makes you think 1,300 is

875
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,679
going to hurt your plant if you do it

876
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,800
right going to give it all that stuff it

877
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,760
needs they grow with

878
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,919
light and as long as you keep the

879
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,480
distance away you don't want you know

880
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:00,480
two inch and you're up at you know 90%

881
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,480
you're going to burn the heck out of

882
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,440
them but I haven't had that issue then I

883
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,760
get a good fade so they must like it

884
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,240
interesting yeah and then what you

885
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,520
mentioned in towards the beginning of

886
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:11,838
the episode how you focus on Red

887
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,440
Spectrum for the Autos to begin so you

888
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:15,440
can get that stretch you can get that

889
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,159
Vigor that's something that I don't

890
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,280
really hear about people doing I think

891
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:21,598
that's kind of a you know another unique

892
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,760
approach to Growing Autos in particular

893
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,640
is you using the light spectrum in order

894
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,040
to kind of get that stretch and just to

895
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:30,719
reiterate your light cycle you had

896
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:33,000
mentioned 24 hours for seedling into veg

897
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:35,319
and then did you say it's an 186 you go

898
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,679
to and veg to flour and then the end of

899
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,800
flow is a 20 hours on four hours off is

900
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:43,279
that right

901
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:45,599
yep yep and it kind of goes with the

902
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,960
progression of the plant you know what I

903
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,160
mean you don't want to kill them with

904
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,880
too much light when they're babies

905
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:54,039
because you'll stress them so I the ppfd

906
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,519
I keep 250 300 when they're seedlings

907
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:59,400
and I keep it I keep the light like 30

908
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:00,800
Ines above them so that it there's no

909
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,160
the ppfd is there but you're not going

910
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:08,560
to cause any burn and then uh when I get

911
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:11,279
into veg I want to be 350 to 600 depends

912
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:13,719
in right in there and then when I go

913
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,119
into flower I'm a th000 plus and I do

914
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:20,519
use a tnb uh container that I usually

915
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:23,119
fill twice doing the run I have so much

916
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:24,920
CO2 down there I'm down there twice a

917
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,599
day my laundry is down there so my

918
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,440
kids's down there all the time and I'm

919
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:30,559
down there doing laundry I have dogs

920
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,159
that are down there all the time and I

921
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,159
leave the temp open a lot too because

922
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:36,799
it's a basement so it can get the

923
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:38,078
humidity can get messed up and with

924
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,160
Autos that's another thing is I don't

925
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,079
have to worry about the tent being open

926
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:41,838
or

927
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,680
closed they're getting the same amount

928
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:45,519
of light either way you know what I mean

929
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,838
and if you can make it breathe and might

930
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:52,239
have an old furnace and it shoots off

931
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:53,480
CO2 a little bit uh so my CO2 is I don't

932
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:57,039
have to worry about

933
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:59,280
it works really well and that's one of

934
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:02,000
the things that's allow you to intake

935
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,280
that more light right is you know people

936
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,639
are probably scratching their head a

937
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,880
little bit like how is this guy doing

938
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:11,679
over 1,300 ppfd you know it's like well

939
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,440
add up the CO2 also the other factors

940
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:16,118
right you you you've increased your

941
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,599
nutrients let's get into environment

942
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:20,480
conditions a little bit temperature

943
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,000
humidity are you running high temp

944
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,760
humidity as well so you can kind of

945
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,358
intake that more light or what's your

946
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,200
strategy for temperature and humidity I

947
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:32,000
found that

948
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:35,000
Auto flowers love 80 60 80° 60% humidity

949
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,719
they love that and I'll stick with that

950
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,800
up

951
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:40,639
until maybe second or third week of flow

952
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,640
and then I will try and drop it down to

953
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:45,719
around

954
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:48,358
72 73 I never want to go on to 70 cuz

955
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:52,000
autof flowers they don't love the cold

956
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:53,318
that much um and then far as humidity

957
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,960
goes I'll try and get it down to 50

958
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:58,000
during flower and that usually gets me

959
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,599
that fade I'm looking for and uh gets

960
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,838
the photosynthesis right and you know

961
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:03,400
it's an Autoflower so it's going to show

962
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,480
up blemishes you'll have an orange spot

963
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,280
here and there a brown spot here and

964
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,800
there that's just part of Auto flowers

965
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,440
you know I mean I've never seen a

966
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,680
perfect one you know and I'm sure

967
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,720
anybody else who grows them will tell

968
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,919
you the same thing that you're always

969
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:18,719
going to have some blemishes some of

970
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,920
them might start off a little wonky

971
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:23,519
looking uh and then they end up being

972
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,480
huge and beautiful it's an Autoflower

973
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:28,079
it's different it's not a photo they're

974
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:30,199
just a different plant

975
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,480
it's a different pheno a different Geno

976
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:35,639
it's it has different Expressions you

977
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,880
know and somebody say oh I got an OG

978
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:39,920
Kush a photo I got o OG Kush of Auto

979
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,079
they're going to be totally different

980
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,039
and they're not going to look the same

981
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,039
cuz you have no idea what feno what

982
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:49,279
parent what mother father's cousin

983
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:51,239
brother you have no clue if it smoks

984
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,240
good it looks good and tastes good who

985
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:55,279
cares that's kind of how I look at it

986
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:57,000
like I'm working on a little breeding

987
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,079
thing myself I'm not way near where you

988
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,079
guys are at

989
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:04,960
but uh I took the Master Yoda and I

990
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:08,359
pollinated it with a original Haze

991
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:14,318
strain that I got from uh AGC Co Mark

992
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:16,039
and uh Frank and it's a 19 week flower I

993
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:19,920
didn't even realize that when I did it

994
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:21,440
but I did it anyway and I'm now once

995
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,079
I've now that I've done that I've got to

996
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,920
rerun it and hit it with something like

997
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:27,039
a fast flowering autoflow something

998
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,159
that's like a 65 dayer that's got a lot

999
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:29,679
of fr

1000
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,239
and then I think I will have a pretty

1001
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:33,598
cool strain when I'm done problem is I

1002
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:36,159
don't have the space to do a huge fenal

1003
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,838
hunt you know I'll shut down my tent

1004
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:39,759
like you do and when I'm done growing

1005
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:40,960
for the year and I'll do a breeding

1006
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,880
project in it and I could probably put

1007
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,559
like eight or 10 in one gals you know

1008
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,160
what I mean and just see what happens

1009
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:48,759
and I would do that in Cocoa I wouldn't

1010
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:50,239
do that in rock wool or or dirt I would

1011
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,240
do it with Coco so you've actually

1012
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,919
ventured into the breeding aspect of

1013
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:55,719
Auto flowers in particular I think

1014
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,639
that's arguably a little bit more

1015
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:59,719
challenging than breeding photo period

1016
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:01,199
right what's the process for that can

1017
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:03,519
you walk us through the steps that you

1018
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:06,799
took in order to really breed n so the

1019
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:11,880
seeds that you get are actually all auto

1020
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:15,200
so from what I've understood and I I I I

1021
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:17,318
study a lot of James loud and I study a

1022
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,799
lot with ZaZa and then I have a friend

1023
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:23,279
who

1024
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:26,160
um who was uh the head of cultivation

1025
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,880
for a commercial grow for a while in

1026
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:29,920
Massachusetts and and he does a lot of

1027
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,358
breeding and stuff so we worked together

1028
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,159
and on that just to it was my first time

1029
00:40:32,358 --> 00:40:35,159
just to walk me through it so we used uh

1030
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:39,559
cordial

1031
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:41,719
Silvera and we got pen off the haze cuz

1032
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:45,239
I I actually bought it a 15 pack from

1033
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:48,239
them and he he he seeded them all out

1034
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:50,959
and he got me some pollen and and uh we

1035
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:54,559
did that we let

1036
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:57,000
it the Yoda grow out we hit it with

1037
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:59,838
pollen uh just with a little Q-tip of a

1038
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,519
brush you know uh we we didn't get a lot

1039
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:04,838
of seeds it did not want to take cuz

1040
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:08,199
this the masota is an F6 so it's very

1041
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:10,119
stable so getting it to flip was not

1042
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:13,159
easy we only got about 30

1043
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:14,760
seeds and but they were good solid

1044
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:18,399
mature

1045
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,920
seeds um and i' you I've tried one I

1046
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,079
threw one out back this year just to see

1047
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,200
what it would do just to I don't even

1048
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:24,960
care if I got anything off it I want to

1049
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:26,598
see its structure its Vigor it's still

1050
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,920
standing it's the middle of November

1051
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:30,599
it's totally Laden with Bud rot it's

1052
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,960
just standing there leaning over it's

1053
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,519
like 6 feet tall and it still hasn't

1054
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,920
finished flowering yet and it was been

1055
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:37,920
out there since June so I said well it

1056
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,559
looks like I'm going to have to

1057
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,400
absolutely hit this with a fast flower

1058
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:43,639
cuz right now it's like a it's an FF

1059
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:47,358
basically like the fast flowering photos

1060
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:48,358
you would get from from uh 42 fast 420

1061
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:50,838
fast

1062
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:55,078
blots it's basically that right now it's

1063
00:41:50,838 --> 00:41:58,159
50% photo 25% Auto so now I would add

1064
00:41:55,079 --> 00:42:00,480
another 25 in from another from another

1065
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,960
or I can self it but selfness not going

1066
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,400
to get me to an Autoflower it might a

1067
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,000
couple of the fenos might end up showing

1068
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,800
Autoflower Expressions but uh and then

1069
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,199
I'm just learning this stuff now it's

1070
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,760
it's it's going to be a long project but

1071
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:15,039
once I get to the point where I actually

1072
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,520
can figure it out and I'll figure it out

1073
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:19,400
I I work hard for it you know I'll I'll

1074
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:20,759
tackle it and right now I'm

1075
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,639
concentrating on growing and once I'm

1076
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,760
doing that this year's Christmas present

1077
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,239
is going to be a propagation tent going

1078
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,800
to put it in my bedroom so it's three

1079
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:30,279
floors away from uh the basement and

1080
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,318
stop breeding that's awesome yeah

1081
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,720
breeding Autos is really a whole Topic

1082
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,239
in itself so we won't dive too deep into

1083
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,679
that one but I was interested to just

1084
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:38,719
hear about your progress on your

1085
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:40,719
personal

1086
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:43,519
project once I get good at and I know

1087
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:46,239
what I'm doing I'll make CH OG

1088
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,599
one awesome kind of going back to

1089
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:51,199
feeding I think one thing that we kind

1090
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,800
of missed was pH do you monitor the pH

1091
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:54,639
at all and adjust it if so what do you

1092
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,079
aim for so where this is a form of

1093
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:57,679
hydroponic growing cuz it is it's

1094
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,800
basically Poor Man's Hydro

1095
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:03,519
I stay between 5'7 and 5'9 5'8 is where

1096
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,440
I want to be but 5 s's fine 5'9 is fine

1097
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:08,800
and I'll adjust up and down as I go and

1098
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,159
I adjust the entire uh Reservoir at a

1099
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,240
time I won't just take the nutrients out

1100
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:13,759
and adjust i' adjust the whole thing I

1101
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:16,879
know I I forgot to tell you I should

1102
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:19,800
have told you this I use recharge every

1103
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,358
time too just a half a gram of uh I

1104
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,200
measure I weigh it out on a scale you

1105
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:26,318
know and a half a g gram goes in every

1106
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:29,679
mix and I also do the same thing with

1107
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:32,318
stash blend I forgot to say that too I'm

1108
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:35,558
running stash blend and I do the half

1109
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:39,199
teaspoon per gallon so I'm doing 10

1110
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:42,599
spoonsful basically in the 20 gallon and

1111
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:44,118
I find it I I it's doing great it's

1112
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:45,519
doing great I haven't had any issues

1113
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:47,358
balls up a little bit sometimes but I

1114
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:49,280
put it in the mixer and that's done in

1115
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:50,679
two seconds I don't worry about that's

1116
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,480

1122
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,759
like oh that's so cool and it's really

Formula that myself Rob pigeons George

1126
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:14,079
Murray George Nate over at gr house we

1127
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,960
all formulate sat down and brainstormed

1128
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,039
and figure out how we can formulate that

1129
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,720
particular blend did a good job yeah I

1130
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:22,119
think it has a lot of good things in it

1131
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:24,598
not everything that it needs right it's

1132
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:26,440
an additive but it's got some really

1133
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:27,960
good stuff there and uh I've seen a lot

1134
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,240
of great results so I'm glad to see that

1135
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,079
you're having some good success with it

1136
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:33,639
oh yeah a lot of questions people always

1137
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:34,880
had is well can you run it with recharge

1138
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:38,519
I run it with recharge all the time I

1139
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:42,599
have no issues none same none at

1140
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:43,960
all and they seem to actually bump EC up

1141
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,838
right so I can get to where I want to be

1142
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,440
a little bit you know be a little bit

1143
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:49,838
low 28 29 whatever and I notice when I

1144
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,200
mix that in there and all that I hit it

1145
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:56,838
right at the three and I'm good I'm

1146
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:58,838
happy and it and it anything that I can

1147
00:44:56,838 --> 00:45:01,759
give the plant that the plant's going to

1148
00:44:58,838 --> 00:45:04,759
like and not show me bad Expressions I'm

1149
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,520
going to use easy easy peasy yeah so

1150
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,800
let's get into genetics a little bit

1151
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:11,000
more I know you named off quite a bit of

1152
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,200
genetics that you've grown before and

1153
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,960
you had good success with but if you had

1154
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:16,960
to step back and think about everything

1155
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,039
you've grown what are the top three

1156
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:23,358
Autoflower strains that in your ranking

1157
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:25,519
are the top three Master Yoda from uh

1158
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:29,759
Mendel brother seeds that was a 2021

1159
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:34,400
Autoflower Cup winner uh for them uh

1160
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:36,119
stable uh heavy feeder grows great just

1161
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,760
the right amount of the really good

1162
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:40,640
structure just the right amount of leaf

1163
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:44,280
to Bud um grape

1164
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:48,558
smoke really well done

1165
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:51,800
um trisket which is is crazy it was a

1166
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:54,280
freebie from uh North LC company before

1167
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:57,640
I started going direct to breeders by

1168
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:59,519
itself and it's from Menino 2020

1169
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:03,558
and they do a good job with auto flowers

1170
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:05,759
too and I just threw it in there and it

1171
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:07,880
just did not stop growing and it was

1172
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,040
growing and growing and growing I and I

1173
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,920
super cropped it and when I did it

1174
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:14,239
created a branch about this long with

1175
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,880
four footballs on it it was insane they

1176
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:20,118
were all bigger than my forearm and I'm

1177
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:22,640
a 250 60b guy and it was huge and it

1178
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:26,039
came out and it with tasted in the it

1179
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:27,879
was just a fantastic run I would love I

1180
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:29,639
would redo that again in a

1181
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,960
heartbeat

1182
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:34,199
and my favorite

1183
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,559
strin

1184
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:38,039
um that I've grown and that I used I

1185
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:39,519
used to get from my caretaker back in

1186
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:42,039
the day before I

1187
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:45,599
grew

1188
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:47,800
uh in my heart it's uh it's something

1189
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:51,079
I'll always grow here and there when I

1190
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,119
can find it but Jack the Ripper it's

1191
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:56,440
created by

1192
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:58,640
subcool um it's just it's in my opinion

1193
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,920
it's one of the the most

1194
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:02,598
steady you don't get too tired you don't

1195
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:05,800
get too you know what I mean and it grew

1196
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:09,559
I grew at a photo and as an auto to to

1197
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,640
test them and the auto was blew the

1198
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:14,240
photo out of the water I I I I grew the

1199
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:16,558
photo outside in 30 gallon pot it got

1200
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:17,598
big it was beautiful but the photo just

1201
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:19,519
had so much because it was growing

1202
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,800
indoors it had so much turs it had so

1203
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,719
much stickiness and oh was awesome those

1204
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:27,359
will be the three favorite I've grown so

1205
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:29,358
far um but I can tell you that

1206
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:32,239
uh now that I'm running speedrun seeds

1207
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:34,279
I'm very impressed uh they're all in

1208
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:36,598
they're all created strains like you did

1209
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:38,440
with ch G uh so you're not going to get

1210
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:40,359
like s diesel or any of that stuff any

1211
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:43,679
of the mainstream white label none of

1212
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:47,400
that they're all like his I'm running

1213
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:49,078
Granite Haze right now it is a F6 and it

1214
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:52,559
was the first plant that they started to

1215
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:55,920
work with now he started working a

1216
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:58,079
little bit with uh a bunch of guys in in

1217
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,440
in in the Triangle and then he built his

1218
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,359
own Autoflower business and he's young

1219
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,280
guys 30s or whatever um but yeah his

1220
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:08,078
stuff it's taken off like crazy it's it

1221
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:11,079
just he just signed a deal with ilgm he

1222
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:13,160
put three strains in there for October

1223
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:15,800
and they late they named them uh

1224
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:18,118
October's like reader of the month or

1225
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:23,440
whatever sold out in three

1226
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:25,760
days all of it gone W I have he sends me

1227
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,318
a lot of stuff I probably have almost

1228
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,839
all of his genetics here now to grow

1229
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:32,039
when I feel like it same with Mendel

1230
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:33,639
Brothers matter of fact I I actually

1231
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:35,279
reached out to aotus to see if I could

1232
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:37,239
give him his cuz they were sent to me to

1233
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,800
send to him to see if he want to do the

1234
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:41,199
thing there to grow together and uh he's

1235
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,119
like I have so many seeds Dave just give

1236
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:45,879
them to somebody I'm like

1237
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:47,280
okay feel the same way all this could

1238
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,039
change because I'm about to run when

1239
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,960
this is done I'm about to run the Ice

1240
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:54,798
Cream Paint Job which is a brand new pH

1241
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:57,480
uh Auto from Mendo brothers and that's

1242
00:48:54,798 --> 00:49:00,000
made with the original chem and a few

1243
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:02,358
other inputs with it

1244
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,039
and I guess the runs that they've been

1245
00:49:02,358 --> 00:49:07,039
done testing have been incredible like

1246
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:08,079
higher than 30% THC which nobody gives a

1247
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:10,838
[ __ ] about that anymore anyway it's all

1248
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:13,039
about flavonoids and stuff but uh from

1249
00:49:10,838 --> 00:49:14,920
what I understand insane gas and insane

1250
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:17,599
taste it might be right up Rob Alle it's

1251
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:20,880
funny I met a guy who's grows sh Banger

1252
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:23,318
and grows headbanger all the time Malik

1253
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,760
from uh from uh professional joint

1254
00:49:23,318 --> 00:49:29,358
rollers but I'm I'm branching out I'm

1255
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:31,440
I'm I just know that those two those two

1256
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:33,119
companies have never stared me wrong

1257
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,000
their stuff has always popped it's

1258
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,599
always been stable it's always really

1259
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,960
good awesome I have to check out

1260
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:40,599
speedrun I've never grown them before

1261
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,679
although I feel just like Lynn where I

1262
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:45,119
have so many genetics more than I can

1263
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:48,039
grow so it's like he told me he had like

1264
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,280
90 uh night a seeds he had a run still

1265
00:49:48,039 --> 00:49:51,838
like Jesus

1266
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,839
Lynn that's crazy I appreciate you

1267
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:55,519
mentioning the Autoflower strains the

1268
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:57,440
top ones that you feel like you've grown

1269
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:59,599
cuz we do have plenty of people here

1270
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:02,079
that are shopping for genetics and you

1271
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,798
know hearing other people's experience

1272
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:05,559
with it and suggestions on what to grow

1273
00:50:03,798 --> 00:50:07,920
is helpful for people now we do have a

1274
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:09,480
lot of beginner Growers that tune into

1275
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,559
the this podcast as well and one

1276
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,358
question I like to ask what advice you

1277
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:15,519
have for beginners that are just getting

1278
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:16,719
started growing Auto flowers if you're

1279
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:17,400
just getting started and you're going to

1280
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:20,719
do

1281
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,400
Autos start in soil learn how to grow

1282
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:23,959
learn the plant learn the structure

1283
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,358
learn what you can feed it in soil how

1284
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,798
to water it every I believe that every

1285
00:50:26,358 --> 00:50:29,078
person that grows should learn how to

1286
00:50:27,798 --> 00:50:31,599
hand water

1287
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:34,000
first cuz once you Master Hand watering

1288
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,720
the rest is easy you can overwater or

1289
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,440
underwater of any kind of plant very

1290
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:41,000
easily and be in trouble now if you're

1291
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,559
going to start with Auto Parts that's a

1292
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,119
whole different story I would use cocoa

1293
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:48,519
and uh just make sure it's got a little

1294
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:49,838
fluff to it because the best advice I

1295
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:50,759
can give to anybody that's going to grow

1296
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,920
an

1297
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:56,640
autoflow is make sure whatever your

1298
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:58,119
medium is it is Fluffy if you're using

1299
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:01,199
cocoa or

1300
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:02,559
soil because the more barrier or the

1301
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:05,279
more resistance you put up to those

1302
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,480
small Roots the smaller the roots are

1303
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,920
going to be and they're not going to

1304
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:13,280
travel as far the fluffier and the more

1305
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,720
you can give them a pathway that's easy

1306
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,798
they're going to shoot down really fast

1307
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:19,318
and you're going to get really good

1308
00:51:15,798 --> 00:51:21,480
Vigor in in the beginning and I would

1309
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:23,199
definitely start with a medium like that

1310
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,639
and just put it in a three gallon or a 5

1311
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:28,480
gallon or a seven gallon I always grew

1312
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:31,639
Autos in a seven gallon um when indoors

1313
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,440
uh and just make sure you water

1314
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:35,078
correctly there's a ton of Meers out

1315
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,960
there you can get now you need to check

1316
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:39,240
where your water and you can use the old

1317
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,838
Tri and true and pick up the pot you

1318
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:44,199
know uh but you really want to learn to

1319
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:46,838
hand water and care for your plant as

1320
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:48,919
organically as you can in the beginning

1321
00:51:46,838 --> 00:51:50,480
uh and then when you get through that a

1322
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,639
few times then you can stop playing like

1323
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,199
I didn't learn your way good advice yeah

1324
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:56,279
it seems like a lot of the Autoflower

1325
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:57,558
Growers that I interview for this

1326
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,519
podcast

1327
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:01,760
a lot of them emphasize what you

1328
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:03,679
emphasize which was the irration in the

1329
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,799
medium and how important it is and how

1330
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:08,159
it really really impacts growth if you

1331
00:52:06,798 --> 00:52:10,960
have that ariation a lot of people

1332
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:12,798
prefer more aier mediums like Coco for

1333
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,119
example because they can get that growth

1334
00:52:12,798 --> 00:52:17,119
and then adding in that air pump down

1335
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,318
below into the medium it helps the

1336
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:21,079
growth even more so yeah I'm seeing a

1337
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:23,679
trend here of the Autoflower grows

1338
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:25,599
everyone's going after those AER mediums

1339
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:27,358
that can uh they get oxygen down in the

1340
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,559
root Zone which which is huge for them I

1341
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:30,039
mean you look at autopa they have the

1342
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,280
little oxygen thing down the bottom now

1343
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:35,039
and all that Oxygen's key and that's why

1344
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,880
I oxygen ate my food right now I have a

1345
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:38,159
little uh fungus nap problem I've never

1346
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,760
had bugs with Rockwell that's one of the

1347
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:41,879
reasons why I went that route cuz I have

1348
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,079
in basement and now I got some fungus na

1349
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,119
so I just had to get some uh mosquito

1350
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:48,359
bits in and that'll take care of that

1351
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:51,838
not a bad thing just a few but I hate

1352
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:54,318
them which's what pigeons do spit

1353
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:56,838
on yeah fungus Nets I battled them so

1354
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:59,039
many times man they are such a pain I'm

1355
00:52:56,838 --> 00:53:00,798
in soil and uh seems to get a little bit

1356
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:03,318
more but I have had it in Coco as well I

1357
00:53:00,798 --> 00:53:05,079
had a really bad infestation in Coco a

1358
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:06,920
lot of people say oh this not you can't

1359
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:08,960
get any in Coco and that's definitely a

1360
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:11,240
misconception you can totally get fungus

1361
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,199
gats within cocoa they just thrive on

1362
00:53:11,239 --> 00:53:15,558
that wet medium you can with rock now

1363
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:17,598
too CU they like the algae you know how

1364
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:20,599
you get a little algae on the top I use

1365
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:22,200
the fluoroflex covers on the top one so

1366
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:24,559
that there none of that so I don't get

1367
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:26,279
on my hands but the little area that's

1368
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:29,000
open between the 6 in and the 8 in when

1369
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:31,599
you stack it gets

1370
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,719
algae and they can eat they can feed off

1371
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:35,798
the algae interesting well this has been

1372
00:53:33,719 --> 00:53:38,118
a fantastic talk I appreciate you

1373

1375
00:53:39,639 --> 00:53:43,159
unique points here when it comes to

1376
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:45,359

for a discount on this seed if you want

1390
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:18,359
to try their stuff to uh grow some Autos

1391
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:22,240
I'm also on Facebook under the same the

1392

future hopefully and there will be uh

1395
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:32,558
