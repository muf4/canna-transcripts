1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,569
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:01,318 --> 00:00:05,519
know me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:07,230
and you'll watch a Max's channel got

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,888
another part test video for you today

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,539
this is the year old 170 watt LED grow

6
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:15,298
light they sent me over this girl light

7
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:17,250
in order to do a park test on it I'm not

8
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:19,259
only gonna do a part test in this video

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,509
but I'm also going to unbox the unit and

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,740
I'm gonna test the heat output on it I'm

11
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,810
not gonna go over all of the features

12
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:26,070
that this girl light has but I will

13
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:27,448
leave a link to this girl light in the

14
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,410
description section below so you can

15
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,630
learn more about it

16
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,939
okay first thing out the box is the

17
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:35,308
driver this LED grow light does require

18
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,949
assembly because of that some of you may

19
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:41,128
call this a DIY grow light next thing

20
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,620
out the box is the power cord after that

21
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:45,769
there is an instruction manual they've

22
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:50,159
included a Phillips head screw driver

23
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:55,949
one rope ratchet hanger one wire hanging

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:58,049
kit a bag of screws here is the side

25
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:58,469
piece they're actually two of them in

26
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:02,939
the box

27
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,260
and lastly is the fixture so like I

28
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:07,109
mentioned this light does require

29
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,368
assembly I'm taking the side pieces and

30
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:11,430
screwing them in to the side of the

31
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:12,780
fixture the screwdriver works okay but I

32
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:31,259
went ahead and busted out my screw gun

33
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:34,519
to make things a bit easier after that I

34
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,959
connect the driver to the LED boards and

35
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:39,868
then connect the driver to the power

36
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,868
cord and then the driver just rests

37
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:44,430
freely on the top of the fixture I

38
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:46,379
personally like to use two rope ratchet

39
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,689
hangers to hang my grow lights because

40
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:50,188
it makes a lot easier to hang and not

41
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:52,859
have to worry about the light spinning

42
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:55,349
or being not level so here I'm using the

43
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:58,140
happy hydro rope ratchets for the part

44
00:01:55,349 --> 00:02:00,688
test I'm gonna use the apogee mq6 20

45
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,299
power meter this is an extended-range

46
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:06,179
PFD sensor which measures from 340

47
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,280
nanometers to 1040 nanometers and the

48
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,750
measurements are in ppfd if this your

49
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,969
first time watching my part test videos

50
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,379
I take the measurements the same way

51
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:14,939
every video and I

52
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,889
by the light distance recommended by the

53
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:18,599
manufacturer I take measurements in

54
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:20,609
Grove tents which have reflective walls

55
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,469
so that could increase the numbers so

56
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,090
just keep that in mind the flowering

57
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:25,979
coverage area for this LED grow light is

58
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,810
2 foot by 2 foot and I'm taking

59
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,909
measurements in a 2 foot by 4 foot grow

60
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,490
tent I'll do my best to keep my meter in

61
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:34,530
a 2 foot by 2 foot space I've plugged

62
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:38,700
the grill light into my kilometer and it

63
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,240
shows 1.3 3 amps pulling 158 watts from

64
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:42,089
the wall

65
00:02:39,240 --> 00:05:50,820
alright let's get into the measurements

66
00:02:42,090 --> 00:05:50,819

67
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:54,649
