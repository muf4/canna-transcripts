1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,600
hey what's up everybody welcome back to

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,839
my channel got a juicy one for you today

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:08,718
breeders aren't on the same page these

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,519
days and it's hurting the grower what do

5
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:14,160
I mean by that well I've spoken to a

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,839
number of breeders over the years and

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,600
they all seem to do things a little bit

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,839
differently now one thing that has

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,880
sparked a little bit of controversy

10
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:24,518
recently was Zaza genetics now I'm not

11
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:25,960
trying to single him out but he does

12
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:28,118
have a way of doing things that's a

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,880
little bit different than other breeders

14
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:33,439
and I just want to talk about that today

15
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,399
and spread some awareness to The Growers

16
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,799
because unfortunately it causes

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,439
confusion in the community when some

18
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,759
people are doing it some way some people

19
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:43,479
are doing another way then there's

20
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,039
another way things are being done and

21
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:48,198
then there's arguments about which way

22
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:50,160
is the right way to go about it so fig

23
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:52,198
i' throw it all out here in this video

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,799
and I want to get your input as well so

25
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:55,960
at the end of this video I want to hear

26
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:57,679
your thoughts about what way do you

27
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,039
think breeders should go about it so I

28
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,518
think one of the bigger disagreements

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,000
amongst breeders is the testing of the

30
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:06,359
genetics before the release I had Zaza

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,159
genetics on my podcast I actually have

32
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,759
an episode coming up in a couple weeks

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,280
here I sat down with him it was actually

34
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:12,759
the second time I sat down with him and

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,320
fired off a bunch of questions and one

36
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:16,359
of the things he mentioned in there we

37
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,319
talked about testing and I was asking

38
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:20,680
about what the proper way to test

39
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,679
genetics before releasing to the public

40
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,479
and one of the things he had mentioned

41
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,799
is that he does all in-house testing he

42
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:29,319
does all the testing himself he wants to

43
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:32,759
be sure that what he releases to anybody

44
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:34,519
else besides him is solid it's not going

45
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,200
to Herm on them he wants to get to the

46
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:37,640
point where he's comfortable and then

47
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,640
release to the public because he doesn't

48
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,000
want to have any bad experiences

49
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,718
happening such as the plant flipping

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,680
herming showing nanners for example at

51
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:48,399
some point throughout the flowering

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,159
stage Now that statement alone caused

53
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,040
another breeder Chaz Westport to speak

54
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,118
up and talk about his perception of

55
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,079
really the importance of having a team

56
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:00,359
of testers so Chad would say not just

57
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,438
test yourself but also send up to a team

58
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,879
of testers around the world he had

59
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:05,798
mentioned he sends testers out to a

60
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,719
whole bunch of different people in

61
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:11,200
different areas some indoor Growers some

62
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,719
outdoor Growers and he likes to send to

63
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,919
new Growers because they often make

64
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,719
mistakes and they tend to stress out

65
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:20,039
plants more than experiened Growers so

66
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:21,759
Chad likes to get input from all of

67
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,919
those people and then make the

68
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,159
determination whether or not he's going

69
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,479
to release genetics at least that's what

70
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,639
I grasp from what he was saying in

71
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,359
another video shout out to pigeons 420

72
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,919
he actually released a video on them

73
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,720
I'll link his video down in the

74
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,958
description section below he goes into

75
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,400
both of their opinions in one video and

76
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,080
I thought it was a that was a pretty

77
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,360
juicy video as well but that's just one

78
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,640
example of how breeders just simply

79
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,800
aren't on the same page with when it

80
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,158
comes to testing now there are other

81
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,719
things people aren't on the same page

82
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:50,479
with breeders aren't on the same page

83
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:52,719
with which is when is acceptable and not

84
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,318
acceptable for plants to Herm now there

85
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,680
are two types of Herms there are Herms

86
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:59,839
where the plant is in flowering and

87
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,159
within the first uh roughly 2 3 weeks

88
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,120
weeks of flowering there will be pollen

89
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,639
sacks at the nodes now from what I

90
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,400
learned this is genetic it's not stress

91
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,158
induced so this is going to be within

92
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,400
the genetics it happens apparently there

93
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:15,479
is a way to make it more recessive trait

94
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,280
so it shows less often that just comes

95
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,359
down to not selecting those and using

96
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,799
those for future breeding projects but

97
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,640
there's also hermaphrodite plants that

98
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:26,040
show intersex traits via nanners and

99
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,919
that is said to be stress induced and

100
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,560
that'll typically show within the first

101
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,719
several weeks of flowering right so the

102
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:37,120
plant starts to flower I've had nanner

103
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:40,759
show as early as week three 4 five very

104
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,120
common that is a big uh you know a big

105
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:45,759
blow to the grower because well you got

106
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,158
to kill the plant at that point now some

107
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,798
people will take and and pluck nanners

108
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,438
off of the plant and try to get the

109
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,438
plant to continue on for weeks and weeks

110
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:55,479
and weeks till Harvest so they actually

111
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,359
get a harvest others are just going to

112
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:59,158
kill off the plant at that point so so

113
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,879
having nner show within the beginning of

114
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:03,039
flower and those first several weeks of

115
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,560
flowering is detrimental now what are

116
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,158
the things that can actually cause the

117
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,878
plant to be so stressed though that it

118
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:09,919
causes naners well there are several

119
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,598
different things one of the things is

120
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,359
heat too high of Heat and the plant can

121
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:17,319
be so stressed out that it causes nanner

122
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,959
too high of light light stress that

123
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:24,199
causes ner I had a uh a blueberry by

124
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,879
msnl years ago and I uh had it too close

125
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,680
to the light I had this one branch that

126
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:29,719
just came up was flopping off towards

127
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,639
the side and it was only about 10 in

128
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,919
from my grow light I thought I was going

129
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,639
to be okay all of a sudden a couple days

130
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,079
later and that whole Branch was just

131
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,360
load of w naners due to light stress I

132
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:43,279
took that upon me because I messed up I

133
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,319
felt like I I had the light Too Close a

134
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,119
grower error that's what I personally

135
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:49,560
deemed it as and I think a lot of

136
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,918
Growers will take responsibility if they

137
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,839
are running plants growing plants

138
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:57,240
outside of the normal parameters so too

139
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,478
high of heat how much is too high of

140
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,960
heat it's a little bit subjective right

141
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:05,399
are we talking over 90° f are we talking

142
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:07,478
over 100° F at what point should we you

143
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,599
know should we test to to ensure that

144
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:12,199
naners aren't going to show before

145
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,160
actually selecting that plant to be used

146
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,439
on a breeding project I think that's Up

147
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,600
For Debate I think there's a lot of

148
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,240
disagreements with breeders amongst that

149
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,600
and just in general showing naners when

150
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,199
there is too high of heat there's some

151
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,680
disagreements on if that's a grower

152
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,840
error or a breeder error Zaza genetics

153
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,879
for example he had mentioned that's a

154
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,279
breeder area you should be breeding that

155
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,918
characteristic out the plant should be

156
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,719
able to take so much light and not

157
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,240
produce nanners other breeders are going

158
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,639
to say oh no they ran it too high of

159
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,319
heat it caused nanners that's a Grower's

160
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,759
fault and so unfortunately this

161
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,280
information is being passed down to the

162
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,080
Growers and there's confusion going on I

163
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,038
actually had a a grower hit me up

164
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,918
recently and he had mentioned the chilo

165
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:51,639
G is showing nanners and when I heard

166
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,599
that my heart dropped you I was like

167
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:57,360
what the heck I selectively I I stress

168
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,319
these plants heat stress light stress

169
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,199
and selected down to F3 why is it

170
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,120
showing nanners this it doesn't make

171
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,960
sense nobody else was reporting this wel

172
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,720
come to find out the grower actually

173
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,198
went beyond the Harvest window and

174
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,319
nanners were shown and that's what I

175
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:13,080
think that uh I thought a lot of people

176
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,879
knew about but if plants are grown past

177
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,918
the Harvest Time there is a high chance

178
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,800
of Nan showing just because the plant it

179
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,680
wants to reproduce right it wants to

180
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,199
continue on it it wants to

181
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,400
self-pollinate create seeds and

182
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,400
obviously have those seeds drop to the

183
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,918
ground and then more plants grow that's

184
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,399
a part of nature so yeah if you're

185
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:33,038
running plants past the Harvest window

186
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,120
it can certainly show nanners and do we

187
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,719
blame that on the breeder or do we blame

188
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,840
that on the grower I think that's

189
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,240
another thing a lot of people argue

190
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,399
about uh you know because we hear about

191
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,598
nanner should never show by any any

192
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,079
circumstances nanner should never show

193
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:47,519
unfortunately they're hearing that

194
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,879
they're pushing plants past the Harvest

195
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,478
window seeing nanners and then they're

196
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,360
going back to the breeder and saying hey

197
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,800
your plant's showing nanners but yeah if

198
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,598
you're within that Harvest window and

199
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,560
you're seeing nanners then plant should

200
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:01,439
be harvested at that point I've had so

201
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,800
many genetics over years where it was

202
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,319
ready for Harvest and I was like I'll

203
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,598
give it another day I wanted to bulk up

204
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,680
a little bit more and then all of a

205
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,478
sudden like a day or two later it has

206
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,439
nanners on it now am I going to go back

207
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:13,959
to the breeder and say hey your plant

208
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,160
showed nanners and expect them to take

209
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:18,318
responsibility I'm personally not I

210
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,160
personally am going to just say hey I

211
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,439
should have harvested a day before but

212
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,759
there are grows out there who are going

213
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,800
to go to the breeder and say hey your

214
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,199
plant showing nanners you have bad

215
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,319
genetics blah blah blah so again this

216
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,038
kind of stems back to breeders not being

217
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,680
on on the same page with things

218
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,120
unfortunately it's trickling down to the

219
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,639
grower and there's confusion it's not

220
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,800
really just the breeding topic that

221
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,240
there's confusion right there's

222
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,240
confusion within lighting there's

223
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,038
confusion within soil biology there's

224
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,720
lots of disagreements that happen but it

225
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:47,598
seems recently there's just about a lot

226
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,039
of people who have just been confused on

227
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,000
the breeding side of things when it

228
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:53,680
comes to when you should test how long

229
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,319
you should test when n should show if

230
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,158
it's the Breeders fault if it's the

231
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,720
Grower's fault there's just there's a

232
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:01,158
lot of questions at this point and seems

233
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,440
like there's not really a clear-cut

234
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:04,918
answer on these things so I want to make

235
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,038
this video to spread some awareness to

236
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,719
let you guys know that there are people

237
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,000
who are just not on the same page about

238
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,520
different things so your beliefs may be

239
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,158
different from theirs the fact of the

240
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:17,318
matter is science hasn't evolved enough

241
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:19,158
to really show everything we need to

242
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:21,439
know about this plant We are continuing

243
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:23,240
to learn new things almost every single

244
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,519
day and that's one thing that makes it

245
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,759
fun for me is it's an endless amount of

246
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,439
things that we can learn again this

247
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,598
isn't bashing any breeder at all I know

248
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:33,958
I named z and I named Chad Westport both

249
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,319
those guys I respect highly I gain

250
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:38,158
information from both of them Zaza's

251
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,320
been on my podcast a couple times Chad's

252
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,120
been on my podcast a couple times I

253
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,039
welcome them on my podcast again in the

254
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,000
future because they really have a lot of

255
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:48,199
great Insight but not all breeders are

256
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,240
on the same page and unfortunately it's

257
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,278
causing confusion for the grower so I'd

258
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,440
love to hear your opinion on what you

259
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,000
think about these things testing how do

260
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,279
you think testing should be done should

261
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,200
it just be internal by one person should

262
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,838
it to be spread out to multiple people

263
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,800
hermaphrodite plants is it the Grower's

264
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,079
error or the Breeders error if the plant

265
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,039
is run to high in naners show

266
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:12,399
temperature is what I'm referring to or

267
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,559
too high of light if the plant is

268
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,159
exposed at too high of light in naners

269
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,799
show is that the grower error or the

270
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:20,480
breeder error I'd love to know your

271
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,399
opinion down in the comment section

272
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,120
below I'm going to link pigeons 420

273
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,559
video down in the description section

274
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,240
below click on that tune into to that

275
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:30,278
that's a good watch it shows both Zaza's

276
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,039
perception and Chad westport's

277
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,958
perception and leave a comment on his

278
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,919
video and let him know that I sent you

279
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:39,838
thank you so much for watching and until

280
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,838
next time peace
