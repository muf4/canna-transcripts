1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,719
coming up on garden talk i usually start

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,199
by going around certain areas on google

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:12,239
maps and when i want to find a new spot

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:14,480
to grow outside cut it in a circle

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,640
so i uh cleanse in the middle and then i

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,960
clamp the medical plants in there so to

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,199
speak and then i try to go out through

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,199
the dishes so i just had a you know a

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,800
little bit of a spot i think that's

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,400
horrible if you're going to grow outside

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,240
i think i think you have to be

12
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,640
responsible of course and don't pollute

13
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,719
the nature be a grown-up you know take

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,558
your with you and or put it in a

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,160
trash bag nearby

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,558
choose often plants that are pretty

17
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,718
sturdy that are known for

18
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:43,919
they can handle these type of not

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,079
optimal conditions try to keep it pretty

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,840
minimalistic to take your with you

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,840
be responsible and that's my advice

22
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,399

92
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,759
mackie how you doing today

93
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,840
i'm good thanks how are you man i'm

doing great great thanks for asking

95
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,560
today we're going to talk all about

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,239
stealth growing so you are a gorilla

97
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,400
grower which is why you're hiding your

98
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,080
identity right now guerrilla growing for

99
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,680
those that don't know is someone who

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,159
cultivates on land that they don't have

101
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,319
the legal rights to cultivate on so it

102
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:49,280
could be private property abandoned

103
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:51,839
sites

104
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,759
areas that are being cared for so on and

105
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,560
so forth in order to do that you have to

106
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,598
implement stealth processes right so

107
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,719
that's what we're going to get into

108
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,959
today

109
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,318
but first how about an introduction can

110
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,479
you tell us a little bit about yourself

111
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,679
and how you got into gardening

112
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,479
of course

113
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,360
i live in scandinavia and uh i've been

114
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:14,158
gardening for uh pretty much

115
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,720
all my grown-up life i started my first

116
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:19,599
grow when i was like 19

117
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,600
now over 30 so i've been growing on and

118
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,639
off and mostly

119
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,280
outside

120
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,879
like real life style so i had a little

121
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,478
experience in the outside growing here

122
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,959
in scandinavia so just a quick

123
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,439
disclaimer we are not encouraging

124
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,279
anybody to break the law this episode is

125
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,759
particular for those who want to

126
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,559
implement stealth growing maybe have

127
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,120
family friends nosy neighbors that you

128
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,079
don't want to know about your grow so

129
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,600
that being said why not grow legally why

130
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,359
do you have to grow illegally where you

131
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,680
live

132
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,360
uh if you're serious uh

133
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,519
how it is here in the scandinavian

134
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,199
countries with a regulation

135
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,370
of the medical plants

136
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,520
you're not allowed to

137
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,840
[Music]

138
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,240
use it you're not allowed to grow it or

139
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,599
even have it on you so

140
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,199
that's why i

141
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,479
started to

142
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,639
do this gorilla type of growing and for

143
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,719
other reasons as well but

144
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,560
yeah i think it's

145
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,759
much better to do it yourself you know

146
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,439
what you get you don't get contaminated

147
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,360
products and

148
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,600
yeah it's easier yeah we had a

149
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,600
pre-meeting before we met today and you

150
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,080
had talked about contamination as well

151
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,080
is a big deal out there so

152
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,240
um is there dispensaries that you can

153
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,839
buy at or is everything just black

154
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,720
market out there

155
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:43,359
everything here is black market um it is

156
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,720
very restricted it's a very high um

157
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,960
you know you get

158
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,240
very big problems if you use it in any

159
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,038
way so

160
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,400
and because the black market is so big

161
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:55,279
here you get

162
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:57,120
really bad quality of products so that's

163
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,719
why i think a lot of people are starting

164
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,879
to implement more

165
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,440
guerrilla style of rome because they

166
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,600
know what they get and the black market

167
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,560
is just like that is a black market so

168
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,960
they

169
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,280
try to make the products way more and

170
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,359
stuff like that and you know get more

171
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,279
money out of people who don't know

172
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,120
anything about it so it's it's it's

173
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,399
about it's a bad market here i think

174
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,160
right now

175
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,359
so i gotta imagine that gorilla growing

176
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,160
is very common out there is that right

177
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,000
i think it's uh more common than people

178
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,560
might know here in scandinavian

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,319
countries especially in the summer time

180
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,280
because in the winter we can't grow here

181
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,000
because the climate is so cold and bad

182
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,318
you have a little bit better summer so

183
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,160
you can grow in the summer time here

184
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,479
okay that makes sense

185
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,199
so what is your overall style of

186
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:51,120
gardening are you doing indoors outdoors

187
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,360
or even soil or cocoa organic synthetic

188
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,160
what's your style yeah

189
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,400
uh if we're starting with medium i'm

190
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,960
usually growing in a soil

191
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,519
just mixing soil and

192
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:06,399
you know peat and perlite and also some

193
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:10,159
cocoa i have a little bit of lamb but i

194
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:12,079
don't use uh only cocoa or only salt so

195
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,560
it makes a little bit of both but i

196
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,879
never do hydro i don't know why i just

197
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,240
feel more comfortable to doing it in

198
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,038
soil

199
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,079
and uh regarding my growth style i grow

200
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:26,079
both indoors and outdoors on the winter

201
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,120
time winter months when it's really cold

202
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,560
here

203
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,598
i grow indoors of course um but then in

204
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,360
mid-may i uh starting to veg the plants

205
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,879
that i'm gonna put out in the summer

206
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,280
months so

207
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,680
i do both okay so you're vegging the

208
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,119
plants starting in may

209
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,598
and then when do you actually bring them

210
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,120
outdoors and plant them outdoors i

211
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:51,918
usually veg them for four or five weeks

212
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,439
right before the outer flowers go yeah

213
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,598
go into flowering

214
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,079
so they are pretty sturdy and they can

215
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,478
handle some hard wins here so then i put

216
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:03,439
them out so i batched around

217
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:06,240
eight templates in the uh mid of may and

218
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:09,038
then i put out them in mid june

219
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,038
and then then they get done in like the

220
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,399
end of july approximately and then i

221
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,918
have already

222
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:17,598
prevenged another 10 flowers or some

223
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,839
medical plants and then i put them out

224
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,159
so okay so you're doing multiple cycles

225
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:25,359
a year and you mentioned autoflowers are

226
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,240
you doing are all the plants autoflowers

227
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,038
yeah i usually do out of autoflowers now

228
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,680
because these summers here are uh pretty

229
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:36,240
short and the weather is not so

230
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,399
stable here in this canadian country so

231
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,759
all the flowers i think is the best best

232
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,440
just yet if you get uh some

233
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,720
quality autofocus they could handle

234
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,519
these temperature changes and um

235
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,040
i i there's some scandinavian companies

236
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,278
like northern seats that have great

237
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,120
outer floors so they

238
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,278
cultivate it for these type of

239
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,360
environments so they're perfect okay so

240
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,838
you mentioned you're vegging indoors for

241
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,200
about four five six weeks or four or

242
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,279
five weeks

243
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,920
so the plants are already flowering when

244
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,278
you bring them into outdoors then

245
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:12,000
they're going the remainder of their

246
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:15,200
life that's typically what like another

247
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,519
five six weeks until you harvest

248
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,839
um and you already have other plants

249
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,440
being started indoors at the same time

250
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,399
and so once those outdoor plants are

251
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,080
harvested

252
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,958
you're bringing those indoor plants that

253
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,440
you have

254
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,759
going at four or five weeks outdoors so

255
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,120
you're getting another cycle in

256
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,439
within the matter of just a couple

257
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,879
months there it's between harvests is

258
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,760
that right exactly exactly so i try to

259
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,360
get

260
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:43,439
at least two two cycles in one summer

261
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,959
around 20 plants

262
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,440
talking about a place to grow um how do

263
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:52,559
you go about determining a good piece of

264
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,399
land or a spot to grow in i usually uh

265
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,439
start by uh

266
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:00,159
going around certain areas on uh google

267
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,720
maps the first of all when i want to

268
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,879
find a new spot to grow outside

269
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,560
and i go go about it checking you know

270
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,639
the place and then i see if it's pretty

271
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,958
close to me so i can either walk there

272
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,958
or take my just take my bike

273
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,039
and get a backpack with water and

274
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,958
nutrition too so i can feed the plants

275
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,879
when they need water

276
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,679
and then i go and scout the place and

277
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,519
see uh if there is a little activity

278
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,838
around there not many people and of

279
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,919
course i don't want any houses close by

280
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,519
so people can see from inside of their

281
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:33,919
houses out and you know see me when i go

282
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,440
in and out of the the um

283
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:37,120
the area

284
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,240
that i picked

285
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,360
and um yeah then i just uh check the

286
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,278
area see how it is with the coverage of

287
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,919
bushes and stuff like that

288
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,200
it's hidden you know all that stuff so

289
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,919
how much sunlight are you looking

290
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,278
typically looking for that spot to be

291
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:57,120
able to get per day yeah i don't have uh

292
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,679
exactly i don't really count the hours

293
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,839
but i think at least like six hours i

294
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,120
think six seven hours i think it's

295
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,600
minimum here

296
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,560
um but i just try to see how the sun

297
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,519
goes when i'm standing it at the growing

298
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:15,119
spot outside see so there's not big

299
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,600
trees that cover the sun so they mostly

300
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,759
get sun you know at least half day you

301
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,440
know and during the time

302
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,879
outdoors

303
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,720
we're talking

304
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,480
june july

305
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,720
august

306
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,959
yeah what is the temperature and

307
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,879
humidity outdoors in the area where you

308
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,319
live or with the area where you plant

309
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,240
sorry

310
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,480
yeah it's uh

311
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,720
getting uh you know the humidity is

312
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,959
rising from the month to month but in

313
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,600
the middle of the summer it's around 50.

314
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,518
could be more if it's really really uh

315
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,680
humid here and really really hot

316
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,480
temperatures a really high summer day it

317
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,719
could of course go up to 60. around 45

318
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,120
to 50 i think it's i mean

319
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,440
on a regular summer day here are you

320
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,720
doing anything to camouflage the grow at

321
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:06,400
all so that nobody can see it uh i

322
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,680
usually um try to find a spot that is uh

323
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,958
[Music]

324
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,159
covered with uh not not big trees but a

325
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,799
little bit

326
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:18,240
like a little bit of bushy like a circle

327
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,919
uh area then i like get in a crowd

328
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,120
crawling like

329
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,559
two three meters in and then i cut it

330
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,799
like in a circle

331
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,399
so i uh cleanse in the middle and then i

332
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,479
plant

333
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,639
the medical plants in there so to speak

334
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,600
and then i try to go out through the

335
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,879
dishes

336
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,759
again so i just had a little bit of a

337
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,759
um you know a little bit of a spot to

338
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,958
have my plants in the middle so people

339
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,958
can't see through the bushes just

340
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,799
from above and i always imagine some

341
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:52,000
people actually doing like booby traps

342
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,759
too going as far as like atigan traps in

343
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,440
case anybody were to walk in that area

344
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,600
there needs like booby traps you set up

345
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,440
or anything to keep people away maybe i

346
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,360
should maybe i should like bear traps

347
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,680
and stuff but uh i haven't i haven't

348
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,560
done anything you know i think it's it's

349
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:08,479
going pretty good so so far so

350
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,239
do you worry about the smell at all

351
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,240
right so we know that these medicinal

352
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,000
plants they can certainly start to smell

353
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,320
that smell can

354
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,839
drift over to other areas

355
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,600
are you worried about the smell at all

356
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,240
do you do anything about the smell or

357
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,240
what uh i have actually

358
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,399
haven't got any problem with the smell

359
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,959
um

360
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,839
you can choose a strain that is a pretty

361
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:34,479
low odor strain like for example the

362
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,959
northern lights auto it's a it's a good

363
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,720
screen because it doesn't smell so much

364
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,838
if you are concerned about the smell

365
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:46,399
outdoors but where i usually have my

366
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:49,279
medical plants it is close to a big road

367
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,958
a bigger road and there's a lot of uh

368
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:51,919
cars and stuff like that so there's a

369
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,000
lot of

370
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,159
stuff going on in the air so it's pretty

371
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,559
hard you know and it's also pretty windy

372
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,600
there it's pretty hard for people to

373
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,439
notice any smell there so i haven't uh

374
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,440
have any problems with that but of

375
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,880
course it depends on where you put your

376
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,800
plants and how

377
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,879
the spring you choose how much they

378
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,879
smell gonna look look up the strain a

379
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,838
little bit beforehand you know be

380
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:15,679
cautious

381
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,279
of where you plant it

382
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,198
okay that makes sense

383
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,639
and then a problem that a lot of outdoor

384
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:25,759
growers face is pollination have you had

385
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,320
any issues with plants accidentally

386
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,480
pollinating your plants at all never

387
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,839
never actually i don't know if that is

388
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,519
just locked luck for me or um

389
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,639
what it is but i've never had a problem

390
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,039
with that when i'm wrong outside so

391
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,000
i'm pretty happy about that

392
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:43,838
okay

393
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,759
and then as far as kind of going back to

394
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,720
like the camouflage stuff and staying

395
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,439
hidden

396
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,160
um you know back in the day

397
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,639
we're talking 20 plus years ago in the

398
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,559
states there was huge crackdowns those

399
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,560
helicopters flying all over the place

400
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,000
they were coming down on these groves

401
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,838
they were looking from above coming down

402
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,720
once they found found these medicinal

403
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,120
plants chopping down plants

404
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,079
and really spending a lot of time

405
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,399
money

406
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,958
on doing this process

407
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,799
do you face any of that in your area are

408
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,879
there always helicopters flying around

409
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,958
actively looking for guerrilla grow

410
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,439
grows and taking plants down

411
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,359
uh no i never heard of

412
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,839
anyone that get uh

413
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,919
you know get in trouble that way you

414
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,120
never hear any helicopters where i live

415
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:32,399
here

416
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,078
it's not a big city where i live it's a

417
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,078
medium city in this game one of the

418
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,879
scandinavian countries and we don't have

419
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:40,638
these type of resources here i feel that

420
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,600
they're gonna do these type of big

421
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,198
operations just looking for uh

422
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,680
you know medical plants and stuff like

423
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,198
that so uh i've never heard of anything

424
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:50,879
uh about that

425
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,958
you know matter so i think you're

426
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,120
totally cool uh you don't have to worry

427
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,119
about that you know of course if you

428
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,240
have a very very

429
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,799
big scale operations outside with

430
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,480
like 500 2 000 plants

431
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,639
maybe you gotta be a little bit more

432
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,600
cautious of course but if you have like

433
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,680
10 20 something like that

434
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,800
i don't think you have to worry about a

435
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,719
thing you know

436
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,879
that makes sense so you're doing it on a

437
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,560
little bit smaller of a scale than some

438
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,799
of the other gorilla growers are right

439
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:24,319
so you said around 10 plants at a time

440
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:26,078
so yeah 10 10 uh approximately 10 15

441
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,320
sometimes you know

442
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:31,039
it depends a little bit about how the uh

443
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,199
the place is looking where i'm gonna set

444
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,958
them if it's big enough or how much do

445
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,719
they handle and stuff like that so do

446
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,559
you grow in the same spot year after

447
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,680
year are you switching up locations

448
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,359
every year

449
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,319
i i usually switch up locations um

450
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,560
because

451
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,639
just just for having a little bit more

452
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,799
caution you know

453
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,000
and this sort of people

454
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,319
you know

455
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,639
notice me going there every summer at

456
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,560
the same time and you know

457
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,399
just to try to be a little bit more uh

458
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,198
low-key and under the radar try to

459
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,640
switch it up um try different places for

460
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,038
different spots

461
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,280
see which spot is best you know how how

462
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,199
the plants feel you know stuff like that

463
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,959
so you do your initial

464
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,120
investigation i guess we call it right

465
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,318
your initial searching for a piece of

466
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,719
land

467
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:21,678
i'm assuming you're doing that in may or

468
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,679
maybe early june maybe a week or so

469
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,439
before you plant

470
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,360
from indoors you're into a plants plant

471
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,798
i'm outdoors is that right

472
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,038
yeah exactly

473
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,599
at that point your oil flowers you said

474
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:35,279
they're weak five-ish

475
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,399
they're pretty decent size i would

476
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:40,240
imagine how are you bringing the plants

477
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,320
in into the location without getting

478
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,319
spotted uh that's a good question i

479
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:47,200
usually take uh

480
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:49,439
like bigger plastic bags uh that i just

481
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,120
can't just carry and then i

482
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,960
either go with uh

483
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:55,439
my car and just put it

484
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,919
in the back seat on my car just go back

485
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,038
and forth a couple of times in hours

486
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,960
that i know

487
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,359
and not a lot of people are going there

488
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,480
so i try to make it as quick as possible

489
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:09,279
of course and not be in the location

490
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,279
for too long uh you know so people

491
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,200
started wondering what

492
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:14,399
that guy is doing in the bushes there

493
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,720
you know that's

494
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,440
to be a little bit weird but uh just big

495
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,880
plastic bags depending on how big the

496
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,080
plants

497
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,840
are you know i can have some uh you know

498
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:27,918
what they call it like a lot laundry

499
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,678
bags they're pretty high sometimes some

500
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,840
you know ikea bags

501
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,440
and stuff like that so it depends on the

502
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,199
height of the plants but

503
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,519
you know i'm growing usually out of

504
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,519
flowers and they don't get so tall so i

505
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:42,639
usually don't have

506
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:44,079
mega bags you know when i put them out

507
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,720
okay so you get the plants to the

508
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,558
location and then are you keeping plants

509
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,240
in containers at that time or are you

510
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,240
doing the transplanting process to where

511
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,839
you're digging down into the ground and

512
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,240
then transplanting from the containers

513
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,199
and planting into the ground

514
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,038
uh last year i just put the plastic

515
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,759
containers outside

516
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:06,160
just on the ground just for easy because

517
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:09,119
it was a pretty uh hidden

518
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,279
location that was uh i didn't have to

519
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,798
grow them down in the ground you know to

520
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,558
make it more stealth

521
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:17,359
so i you know

522
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:19,279
didn't you know started digging the soil

523
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,359
and ground stuff like that so it depends

524
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:24,399
a little bit uh how the location is

525
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:27,119
looking if i want to be more stealth and

526
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,200
if people can you know see through it

527
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,798
and maybe watch plants or see that

528
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,679
something's going on maybe i dig them

529
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:33,759
down

530
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,000
but uh this year i'm finding a good

531
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,279
location right now and uh i think i'm

532
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,279
just going to

533
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,399
put the put the containers out on the

534
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,720
ground

535
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,519
you know so make it easier for myself

536
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,919
you know

537
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,200
do you do anything for hardening off and

538
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,080
for those that don't know what hardening

539
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,720
off is it's doing things to acclimate

540
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,558
your plants that you started indoors to

541
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,200
the outdoor environment are you doing

542
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:59,119
anything for hardening off of the plants

543
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,319
mostly not but it depends a little bit

544
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:04,319
on the weather here if i have uh

545
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,399
you know if it's starting to be pretty

546
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,678
good weather a couple weeks before i put

547
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,440
them out

548
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,759
sometimes i can just put it on my

549
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,200
balcony uh some of those plants it is

550
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,000
really great weather

551
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,720
uh

552
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,159
so make them accustomed to the outside

553
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,400
climate a little bit more and the wind

554
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,360
and stuff like that but i usually don't

555
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,960
think about that as much um i

556
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,359
choose often plants that are pretty

557
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,600
sturdy that are known for

558
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:32,879
they can handle these type of not

559
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:34,558
optimal conditions that is here in where

560
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,640
i lived so

561
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,399
i haven't had any problems with that uh

562
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,480
to harden them and stuff like that i

563
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,240
think they um they

564
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,759
are pretty good you know when they're

565
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,000
ready and

566
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,919
yeah they could handle the switch from

567
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,038
inside the outdoors pretty pretty good i

568
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,520
think so okay and then once you get to

569
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:55,440
the location you have your plants there

570
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,759
how many trips back and forth are you

571
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,360
typically doing per week

572
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,798
in order to

573
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,439
you know get in there with maybe you're

574
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,960
bringing in equipment or tools

575
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,720
fertilizer

576
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,079
watering the plants can you talk to us

577
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,279
about all of that yeah um you know first

578
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:15,519
time then first time i get there i just

579
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,519
putting the plants there don't do

580
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:18,639
anything and then i get out as quick as

581
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,359
possible

582
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,080
then i usually wait for approximately

583
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:26,719
five days before i go there so maximum

584
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:29,519
once a week i i go to the spots and just

585
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,679
water them i have bottles in my backpack

586
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,839
two liter bottles pre-filled

587
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,159
pre-fertilized everything is ready so i

588
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,359
can just take them off you know out of

589
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,840
my backpack

590
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,519
and just splash it on the medical plants

591
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,720
you know as quickly as possible and then

592
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,200
i'm out again

593
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,279
so i just i don't like lurk around in

594
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,440
the spot too long i just do what i have

595
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,879
to and then i get out there

596
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,240
and get out of there as quickly as

597
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,320
possible so

598
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,480
every five days i would say i go to the

599
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,599
spot in the summertime but if it is a

600
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,759
really

601
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,519
warm summer and the plants of course

602
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,119
need more water

603
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:04,558
i might get there

604
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,239
every third day or something like that

605
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,639
depending on the weather of course and

606
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,558
then what are you using for fertilizer i

607
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,600
usually usually just

608
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:15,839
use one fertilizer it's a bloom

609
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,319
fertilizer it's nothing special it's a

610
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,720
brand from here it's a local brand

611
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:23,038
so i can't give any recommendations but

612
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:27,038
it's a very it has everything you need

613
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:30,480
and i don't use that before uh

614
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:32,960
the i think is the fourth or fifth week

615
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,839
so after five weeks i started to use

616
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,360
that on the on the plants but not before

617
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,279
i don't think they need it the special

618
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:41,759
outer flowers they're pretty fragile

619
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,798
easy to over fertilize these type of

620
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:44,879
plants

621
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:46,798
so i use a synthetic fertilizer when

622
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,320
they're starting to bloom

623
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,200
usually when i put them out the first

624
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:51,519
week

625
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,080
and then i use it every watering

626
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,639
until they're ready to harvest basically

627
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:59,119
so and now you're checking like a ppm or

628
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,440
an ec or are you ignoring those things

629
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,239
and just kind of doing the

630
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,080
um

631
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,000
every week feeding

632
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,079
every five days or whatever how often

633
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,720
you go to the site yeah i don't check

634
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:12,399
anything about that not ph nothing like

635
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,960
that they just try to keep it as simple

636
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,640
as possible uh just

637
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,000
taking the recommendations on the bottle

638
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,840
that i know

639
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,200
they can handle i've tried it before of

640
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:22,959
course

641
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,038
on the strain before so i know i don't

642
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,798
over fertilize so i know my measurements

643
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:27,679
how much they need and how much they can

644
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,079
take

645
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,880
and then i just mix it up with water and

646
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:36,079
then i'm out doing the thing i don't

647
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,840
use any boosters or any stuff like that

648
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,000
i just have a simple

649
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:42,639
you know good fertilizer for for the

650
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,960
blue stage that i think works really

651
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,759
good for me i use it even indoors as

652
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,840
well

653
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,440
and you know yeah it's it's pretty

654
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,519
simple but it works you know i don't

655
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,360
think you have to complicate it so much

656
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,639
you know if you have a

657
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:58,879
good uh like round fertilizer yeah basic

658
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,320
fertilizer so i can imagine that you you

659
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,000
you've brought in the nutrients there

660
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:04,480
and you just keep the nutrient bottles

661
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,079
there on site and so every five days

662
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,558
you're just using the bottles that

663
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,918
you've left there at that spot

664
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:11,839
the water i'm still trying to wrap my

665
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,000
head around because you you said you've

666
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,839
gotten 10 plants at a time

667
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,079
it seems like a lot of water would need

668
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:19,439
to be brought in are you doing multiple

669
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:22,158
trips

670
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,080
for water i usually i usually just do

671
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,360
one trip i just fill but i don't water

672
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:30,720
them that much i give them maybe like

673
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:33,038
50 centiliters 60 centiliters

674
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,960
of water to each plant so

675
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,640
i don't over water them i'm pretty

676
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,360
cautious with how much i water them i

677
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,278
think

678
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,119
for a seven to nine liter container that

679
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,038
i usually use for these outer flowers

680
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:43,839
they don't really need that much you

681
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:46,319
know

682
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:49,599
uh and i don't try to flush them too

683
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:51,599
much so they can hold the nutrients

684
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,879
in the container so i don't flush them

685
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,199
up every time

686
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,159
and you just have to use even more

687
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,319
nutrients so i usually have

688
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,039
a lot of two liter bags have a big

689
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:06,319
backpack just pressing them down

690
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:09,359
i uh pre uh fill it back home so i don't

691
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:11,599
have any nutrients at the spots so i

692
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:14,079
just pre-fill everything at home put it

693
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:16,558
in my backpack just go with my bike

694
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,960
or or my car sometimes but usually my

695
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:21,200
bike uh early in the morning

696
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,519
water them and then it's uh then it's

697
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,759
done for five days usually so okay and

698
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:28,480
then you said you don't do any type of

699
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,960
flushing um you'd like to just water in

700
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,720
so there's really no runoff happening

701
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,558
for the entire grow now what about at

702
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,880
the end of the grow before harvest a

703
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:39,200
common technique that we know of is

704
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,520
flushing right they'll flush the

705
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,278
nutrients out of the medium in order to

706
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:44,960
kind of force that senescence to happen

707
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:46,558
within the plants

708
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,200
are you doing a flush

709
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,960
before harvesting yeah i have i've heard

710
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,960
that a lot of people do that but i've

711
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,558
also heard that it doesn't make any

712
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,480
sense to the plants

713
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:57,839
if you flush or not that's what i've

714
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,919
heard uh

715
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,599
like later later studies now that

716
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,559
recently came out

717
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:04,319
from uh

718
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:06,480
like really good growers so i never

719
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,240
flush i don't care about that uh maybe

720
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,400
you should maybe you don't i don't know

721
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,400
i haven't heard anyone that could tell

722
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,720
the difference from the plants that has

723
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,400
been flushed and from one that haven't

724
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,400
been flashed but

725
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,960
i don't know it's up to each

726
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,038
uh each person to know if

727
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,960
they won't flush or not but i i usually

728
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:26,558
don't care about that you know yeah in

729
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,919
my opinion i think it's pretty good that

730
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:29,519
you don't flush

731
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,520
the reason why is one thing that's very

732
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,038
common with the gorilla growing is you

733
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,200
hear about people

734
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:36,798
using synthetic nutrients outdoors

735
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,679
flushing their plants

736
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:42,319
runoff of phosphorus and nitrogen going

737
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,278
to the local local streams close by and

738
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:47,278
then toxic algae blooms occurring it's a

739
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,359
huge problem huge problem around the

740
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:52,079
world actually and it's happening due to

741
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,678
these fertilizers overuse of fertilizers

742
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:56,158
so you kind of getting into more of a

743
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,519
precision thing not doing the runoff

744
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,440
it's really better for the environment

745
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:02,240
right you're not having those nutrients

746
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,679
run off and cause issues yeah exactly

747
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,359
phosphorus is

748
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,278
yeah as you said first phosphorus is

749
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:08,558
horrible to get down in the ground of

750
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:10,960
course as well

751
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:13,038
and then another thing you often see is

752
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,960
in gorilla grows is trash being left

753
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,558
around and now this is obviously this is

754
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,558
the mainstream media we're talking about

755
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,398
so they're going to film guerrilla grows

756
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,720
they're going to focus on the trash

757
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:24,639
left over

758
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,839
what's your stance on that are you and

759
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,520
you can be honest are you leaving the

760
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:30,398
trash hanging around are you collecting

761
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,759
the trash no i i no of course i think

762
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,759
that's horrible if you're going to grow

763
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:36,158
outside i think you have to be

764
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:38,879
responsible of course and don't pollute

765
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,640
the nature you know and uh

766
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,880
be a grown-up you know take your

767
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,360
with you and or put it in a trash bag

768
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,520
nearby i try to just take every bottle

769
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,278
and stuff like that with me when i go

770
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,599
home again just put it in my backpack

771
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:52,798
and down i'm going off you know so

772
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,439
it's not that i

773
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:57,359
stay at the spot for so long so i just

774
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,600
have my water bottles i water then i put

775
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:01,839
them down back in my backpack and i'm

776
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:04,240
out of there again so i don't have like

777
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,398
basically anything around there laying

778
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,839
around you know it's just a plan to

779
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,000
stand there you know you would think

780
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:11,918
that would be a tip for to stay stealth

781
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,599
right is to remove the trash because if

782
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,520
people see the trash people walk by the

783
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,119
area they see the trash that's gonna

784
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:20,879
you know attract some eyes towards that

785
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:22,639
way so resist uh so try to keep it

786
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,120
pretty minimalistic to take your

787
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,919
with you uh and you know be

788
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:30,319
irresponsible and that that's my advice

789
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,000
how do you avoid getting spotted i mean

790
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:33,918
you're going there pretty frequently

791
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,798
right every five days or so you're going

792
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,120
there

793
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:39,679
how do you avoid getting spotted are you

794
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:42,398
going at a certain time of the day where

795
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,600
maybe there's less population around the

796
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:45,918
area

797
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:48,798
or have you ever gotten spotted before

798
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,799
yeah i try to go of course times where i

799
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:53,278
know that a lot of people are either at

800
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:56,000
work or sleeping so

801
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:58,159
like five in the morning 4 30 sometimes

802
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,119
in the summer time i think it's a it's a

803
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,600
good

804
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:04,479
time to go there if you're gonna water

805
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:07,199
and um of course i don't pick a spot

806
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,960
that there is a lot of houses nearby but

807
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,278
uh there are three people of course

808
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,679
walking that could see you so you gotta

809
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:16,079
choose to be there at certain times you

810
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,759
know you have to like put your alarm

811
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,439
maybe early in the morning to uh

812
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,359
minimize the risk of someone seeing you

813
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,278
at the spot or maybe in the middle of

814
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,278
the night but i think it's better in the

815
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:26,398
in the early morning to do it so you can

816
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:28,640
see

817
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:31,599
where your plants are all right you did

818
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,000
mention a somewhat high of a humidity

819
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:36,158
early on in this episode you know at

820
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,960
high humidity days you're at risk for

821
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:42,240
things you know so your risk at bud run

822
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,079
mold powdery mildew are you facing any

823
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,798
of those issues at all has that happened

824
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:49,839
to you at all yeah it's happened a

825
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:51,759
little bit but uh it's you know

826
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:54,480
not not a whole plant you know not a

827
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:57,119
whole plant had some some buds that were

828
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,798
affected uh last year and i just cut

829
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,759
them off and just threw them away of

830
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,558
course

831
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:02,398
but

832
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:04,720
yeah you can't really do anything about

833
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,719
it you know you have to um

834
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,558
hope that everything is going pretty

835
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,120
good and that's uh summer is pretty

836
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:13,599
windy that also get a lot of sunshine so

837
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:15,759
it gets the air circulation

838
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:18,319
around the the medical plants that you

839
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:20,879
have planted outside and also maybe you

840
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,798
can choose a location that is not too

841
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,520
windy of course but have a little bit of

842
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,839
a air circulation so it's not

843
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:30,240
so closed off that they can't like

844
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,720
breathe and there's too heavy of a

845
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,359
too heavy bushes or trees around so they

846
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,000
it's suffocated basically but

847
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:40,240
yeah it's it's uh i think it's bigger

848
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,960
problem inside with bad ventilation that

849
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,640
is

850
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,840
outside depending on the weather of

851
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,000
course but

852
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:48,079
i think they're gonna be fine

853
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,839
so that's one problem the other problem

854
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:54,000
would be a very common outdoors is pests

855
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:56,480
um what do you do in order to prevent

856
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,119
pests from invading your grow outdoors

857
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,919
yeah that's a good question uh i usually

858
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:03,038
put

859
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:05,440
this copper tape around the stem of the

860
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:07,919
plants uh because we have a lot of

861
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,360
problem with snails here that likes to

862
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,880
chew on the

863
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:14,158
medical plants

864
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,840
so i usually just take a pet bottle like

865
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,080
if you simply do cola bottle or

866
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:21,839
something like that cut it off you know

867
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:24,798
like yeah this uh big so i just cut it

868
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,558
cut off a bit of the uh

869
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,960
bottle in a circle and then i just put

870
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:31,599
it around the stem in the uh lower part

871
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,440
and then i take the copper band around

872
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,678
i'm gonna put it on all the plants so

873
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,320
they can't like climb up

874
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:41,200
on the stem and chew on your plants you

875
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:43,359
know so that's basically the one thing i

876
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,880
always do and it uh it helps a little

877
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,398
bit

878
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,240
but of course you can't do

879
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:51,119
everything and i don't want to

880
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,278
spend too much of money on certain

881
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,518
things and pest control and

882
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:58,000
yada yada so that's the only thing i do

883
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,399
it's going to be pretty good actually

884
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,398
and now talking about plant training

885
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,439
flip it up a little bit do you do any

886
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:05,918
type of

887
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,480
training in all plants whether it be any

888
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:11,120
low stress training topping super

889
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,558
cropping filming any of the training

890
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:15,678
techniques at all

891
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:18,240
yeah i uh usually did more back in the

892
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,798
day uh with the techniques but i have

893
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,000
noticed uh that if you

894
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:24,158
i don't know if

895
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,319
this is of course some plants can handle

896
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,760
the family better than others but if you

897
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,240
for example film more tops on

898
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:32,558
autoflowers okay they get more branches

899
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,599
they get more bud sites and of course

900
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:36,639
but

901
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:38,879
sometimes i feel that the buds are

902
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,399
too like uh

903
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,559
they're they're not so hard what do you

904
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:43,558
call it

905
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:48,079
not so dense exactly so

906
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,879
the less you do to stress the plant i

907
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:54,480
think that's better of course you get a

908
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,840
little bit less of uh outcome some say

909
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,319
when they're ready

910
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:00,879
but uh yeah

911
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,798
maybe just some filming sometimes i do

912
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,960
but i don't really low stress the plants

913
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:07,119
i put out

914
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,200
maybe just filming something like that

915
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:10,479
something easy i don't want to spend too

916
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,240
much time

917
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,558
on it you know

918
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,440
to stress train them how big are these

919
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:19,918
plants actually getting before you like

920
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,360
when you harvest how big are the plants

921
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,440
yeah um as you know autoflowers don't

922
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:28,879
grow as big as uh for the period plants

923
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,320
so they're not huge monsters but uh

924
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,360
of course they grow a little bit bigger

925
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:36,319
outside than indoors so around 120 to

926
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,599
one and a half meters i think it's um

927
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,000
could be

928
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:42,319
approximately how big they get outside

929
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,960
what i've seen from my growth at least

930
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:48,000
but uh of course you can grow bigger oil

931
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,840
flowers and or smaller as well but

932
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,480
around there and then so you make that

933
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:53,759
decision to harvest the plants are you

934
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,519
harvesting

935
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:58,240
all the plants at the same time and then

936
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,919
doing trips back and forth on the same

937
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,558
day in order to

938
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,600
remove the plants from the site i try to

939
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:05,839
uh

940
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:08,480
harvest the same day

941
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:10,239
actually uh hopefully

942
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,480
of course they're the same strain but of

943
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,959
course they can differentiate how long

944
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,440
in the development the plants are but

945
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,159
i usually try to harvest the same day or

946
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,280
each

947
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,000
other day

948
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,839
uh to minimize me going front to back

949
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,320
front and back all the time you know it

950
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:28,239
makes my

951
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,639
potential that someone might see me and

952
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,039
also i don't want to do that

953
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,280
so then i just harvest them

954
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,878
every plants in one day hopefully and

955
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,399
then i put them down

956
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:42,960
in uh like black sacks

957
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:44,239
plastic bags bigger plastic bags then i

958
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,159
get out of there

959
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,479
and then i usually wait some days and

960
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,398
then i take the plastic containers with

961
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,240
me again

962
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:54,559
so i just clean the spots

963
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:57,199
a couple days later all right so then

964
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:59,119
you bring them back to your your home

965
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:01,279
let them dry exactly what do you

966
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,960
typically do for drying conditions

967
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:08,800
i usually have a spare room where i live

968
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,440
and then i have uh my window there

969
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,280
on a little bit half open

970
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,920
so and then i hang it

971
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,320
just straight down i have for the uh

972
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,159
what do they call it the cur the curtain

973
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,440
there's a pole a curtain pole and just

974
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,799
hang them there

975
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,280
and then i have a fan that's just

976
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,839
blowing uh through the room

977
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,519
uh so yeah and so i have some like odor

978
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:33,920
control uh buckets of some kind that i

979
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:35,039
do usually place out around them so it

980
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,920
doesn't

981
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:40,239
smell so much but uh yeah it works

982
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,480
pretty good actually so

983
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:44,639
it's very very minimalistic you know but

984
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,039
you know what what can you do

985
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:51,118
and so do you do do you do a wet trim or

986
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:53,599
a dry trim i always uh dry trim actually

987
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,800
i always stretch them i just take the

988
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,920
bigger

989
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,400
leaves off

990
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,720
first before i hang them up to dry so it

991
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,680
gets a little bit better aeration

992
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:05,519
between the the plants and the stems

993
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:07,118
they don't touch each other and stuff

994
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:08,960
like that

995
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,039
and uh then when they're dry usually

996
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,639
just five six days i think then they're

997
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:15,279
pretty good i've done

998
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:18,159
usually the same process putting them in

999
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,519
glass containers or in the other process

1000
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:20,960
with curing

1001
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:22,559
let's get deeper into curing so you're

1002
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,800
putting them into glass containers what

1003
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:27,039
size containers are you working with and

1004
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,680
are you doing any of the the burping

1005
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:31,199
process uh you know a common process

1006
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:33,199
that's used

1007
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:34,960
yeah of course i uh

1008
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:35,919
how many liters are they i think they're

1009
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,760
around

1010
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,800
1.8 liters i have mason jar containers

1011
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,960
with extra lid on top that i usually use

1012
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,720
glass containers always

1013
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:51,280
after six days before i've

1014
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:53,519
cut them down and trimming the buds

1015
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,320
after six days i put them down in the

1016
00:36:53,519 --> 00:37:00,000
containers and then every day i open

1017
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:02,880
them for at least an hour first week

1018
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,519
and then i close the lid again and then

1019
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,920
the second week i do it less frequently

1020
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:09,759
and just feel the buds

1021
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,400
see how they react to your curing

1022
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,480
process you know just smell them

1023
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,800
look for eventual mold and stuff like

1024
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,119
that and there if you feel

1025
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,200
that they're pretty you know moist still

1026
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,800
maybe you should keep the lid off for

1027
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,519
longer so it's

1028
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,839
up to each and everyone to just feel the

1029
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:30,800
flowers and see how they react to your

1030
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:32,480
your hearing process and um you know

1031
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,839
so it's hard to give a recommendation

1032
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,719
that um

1033
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:37,119
i just

1034
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:39,759
just go and feel and basically see

1035
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,000
feel smells and i'll see how they react

1036
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,720
are you eventually packaging

1037
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,679
up

1038
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,598
and

1039
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:47,519
selling locally

1040
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,400
or are you growing for yourself

1041
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:51,838
yeah i mostly grow for myself and some

1042
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,880
friends you know can

1043
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:58,559
get something if they want but i'm not a

1044
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,480
i don't you know self like big scale

1045
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,960
it's just for me myself you know some

1046
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,960
people take a beer to relax and i can

1047
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,679
take something before i

1048
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,519
go to bed to calm down sometimes if you

1049
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:11,598
have a stressful life like a lot of us

1050
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,280
do you know with work and family and

1051
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,519
stuff so

1052
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,680
it's just a relaxation for me it's

1053
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:18,719
definitely relaxing that is for sure

1054
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:20,719
yeah

1055
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:23,358
all right so we went through just about

1056
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:25,039
everything there in a nutshell um i did

1057
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:26,880
want to ask you

1058
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:28,800
for those that are looking to implement

1059
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,400
stealth growing whether it be you know a

1060
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,039
nosy neighbor that they want to hide it

1061
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,400
from a friend family member do you have

1062
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:38,000
any general advice for them uh

1063
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,400
i think you should

1064
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,358
first first of all

1065
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,039
like read read a little bit about it

1066
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:48,159
on the internet before you start

1067
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:50,559
something get some knowledge before uh

1068
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:53,279
be pretty cautious where you buy

1069
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,078
the stuff that you need to do this

1070
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,960
and

1071
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,280
don't say anything to anyone if you're

1072
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,440
gonna do this

1073
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,079
the way i do it don't tell anyone not

1074
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,000
your friends no one uh just keep it for

1075
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,640
yourself do it

1076
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,719
in your own spare time and don't over

1077
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,639
complicate things and buy

1078
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:14,319
a ton of fertilizers from different

1079
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:15,759
brands you just want to sell your stuff

1080
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,680
to make money

1081
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,839
try to keep it simple

1082
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:22,000
buy something from a uh you know

1083
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:23,519
well-established brand that knows work

1084
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,880
read a little bit about the company and

1085
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:27,440
stuff like that

1086
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,680
and you know scout the location and

1087
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,519
everything like that beforehand a couple

1088
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:33,598
of months before

1089
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,920
looking people around or they're walking

1090
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,920
a lot of people around your site

1091
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,880
houses

1092
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,358
you get easy access to the growing space

1093
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,358
that you choose outside when you have to

1094
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:47,920
get your car there and stuff like that

1095
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:50,400
you know so try to keep it uh as close

1096
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,800
to you as possible

1097
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,320
minimalistic and be cautious of course

1098
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,880
