and I've been to your gr before and one

66
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,639
thing I noticed is you grow on Rockwell

67
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,400
entirely yeah and we are overdue for an

68
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:35,119
episode of growing in Rockwell I haven't

69
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,000
had anybody on this podcast growing in

70
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,959
Rockwell yet I've had some people that

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,158
started out in Rockwell they did

72
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,039
seedlings in there and then they

73
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:43,799
transferred over to either like a soil

74
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:45,878
or cocoa or hydroponic system for

75
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,959
example but y growing in Rockwell

76
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:49,840
throughout the entire growth cycle

77
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,640
that's a way you can do it successfully

78
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,519
and so I'm excited to have you on here

79
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:56,279
today and talk all about it yeah bro I

80
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,039
appreciate you having me on bro it's

81
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,080

and the boys has been uh just it's just

83
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,040
so organic how this all happened man

84
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,400
that's the only way I can put it that's

85
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,318
the best way to describe it is just

86
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,439
organic you know so I appreciate you man

87
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:13,359
big time I completely agree before we

88
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,680
get into Rockwell deeply can you give us

89
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,799
an introduction tell us a little bit

90
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,120
about yourself and how you got into

91
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,760
gardening yeah uh my name's Chris I'm

92
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,519
the owner founder of Swank genetics uh

93
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,639
we're essentially a genetics company uh

94
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,158
uh we focus primarily on breeding

95
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,759
genetics and and eventually as soon as

96
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,679
we get to a certain point we'll be off

97
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:35,120
offering those genetics in various forms

98
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,439
seeds tissue culture whatever um but

99
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,759
yeah primarily a genetics company I fell

100
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:44,280
into it by just loving the plant from a

101
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,878
very very young age um I got into it

102
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,840
around 2001 and I didn't see my first

103
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:54,078
living plant till around 2013 so um yeah

104
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,519
I that was it I mean that was the change

105
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,599
I saw the plants for the first time

106
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,400
growing in full flower and and it just

107
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:01,959
changed everything I had to learn I had

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,319
to figure it out I had to become a part

109
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,878
of it and uh a buddy of mine who showed

110
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,399
me that Garden was willing to take me

111
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,840
under his wing and teach me how to grow

112
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:14,400
and did that for a while and then we uh

113
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,319
came back left California and uh which

114
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,879
is where his garden was and came back to

115
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,238
Vegas and started my own thing that's

116
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,159
awesome yeah before we started recording

117
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:22,478
you mentioned you were doing it for

118
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,400
about 11 years have you been in Rockwell

119
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,918
the entire time or have you tried other

120
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:29,198
grow methods so initially when I learned

121
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:31,159
they were in Coco um so at the Garden I

122
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,840
was learning out NorCal they they had an

123
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,919
outdoor which was all soil and then they

124
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:37,239
had an indoor which was all cocoa under

125
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,399
High Press sodium so initially I learned

126
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,038
Cocoa High Press sodiums indoor and then

127
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:45,038
just straight soil with amendments

128
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:46,560
outdoor um and then honestly in doing

129
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:48,000
that I mean I know there may be people

130
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,399
that aren't going to like me saying this

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,199
I just I could not wait to never touch

132
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:56,599
soil again I just it's back breaking bro

133
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,199
especially when you're at scale and

134
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,720
you're really doing it for real on a

135
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:04,520
farm it's it's no joke and hats off to

136
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,479
every Gardener that that does it because

137
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:10,399
it's you guys are the real the real

138
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:11,959
Workforce for real so I just me being

139
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,198
the type of person I am initially was

140
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:15,799
like all right well how can I create

141
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,120
more efficiencies just naturally in my

142
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,280
life I'm all about finding efficiencies

143
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,680
and soil just was not it for me and

144
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,439
neither was Cocoa neither was most of

145
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,319
the Alternatives until I stumbled on to

146
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:28,319
specifically Rockwell you mentioned

147
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,840
being at scale and I think that's one

148
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,280
good thing to clarify is you're not just

149
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:35,038
a small home grower with a couple tents

150
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:37,359
you are growing at scale and uh yeah

151
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,959
that makes a big difference going from

152
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,240
just growing a handful of plants six or

153
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,120
12 plants up to Growing I don't know

154
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,439
what are you growing 50 100 Plants Plus

155
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,918
plants at a time or what it dep it

156
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,519
depends like when we were on the farm it

157
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:53,318
was it was uh I mean we had I mean this

158
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:56,918
is back in like the the prop 215 days so

159
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:59,840
um we had you know 99 outdoor and then

160
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:03,478
he had I don't even know you know 15

161
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:05,879
lights indoor you know so yeah thousands

162
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:08,399
at that point but it it's all broke down

163
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,959
like he's that the person that taught me

164
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,839
how to grow is kind of where I got the

165
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:15,239
ideology of you can have a 100 lights or

166
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,719
200 lights and still be small batch and

167
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,680
that's very counterintuitive to what

168
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,160
people think and it's like well no it's

169
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,199
just because you don't have to build a

170
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,160
60 light room or a 100 light room you

171
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,840
can have a 100 lights and have 10 10

172
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,240
light rooms that are all staggered out

173
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:31,239
in various points of growth you know to

174
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,319
and you can that'll allow you to have

175
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,840
you know variety and multiple harvests

176
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:36,160
of different genetics so you're not just

177
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:38,598
sitting there doing the same thing over

178
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,319
and over so so yeah like he's the one

179
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,719
that kind of put me into that ideology

180
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,879
where it's like damn you've got a lot of

181
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,440
lights but really you don't because it's

182
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:49,079
all in eight and 10 light rooms got it

183
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,598
so why rockwool first of all what is

184
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:52,560
rockwool we have a lot of folks that are

185
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:54,240
beginners they might not even know what

186
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,839
it is can you explain what is rock wall

187
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,199
and why growing it what are the benefits

188
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:01,878
to grow plants in Rockwall yeah so it's

189
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,680
basically uh spun rock so they heat rock

190
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,360
up and uh I don't know that this is the

191
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,918
necessarily the greatest analogy for it

192
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,199
but think of like a cotton candy machine

193
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:10,799
you know they they basically get the

194
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,520
Rock from my understanding to like a

195
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,800
almost a molten State and they spin it

196
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:21,359
and it becomes this very fibrous

197
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,720
um yeah it's like a fibrous almost

198
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,400
almost kind of like fiberglass

199
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,680
insulation for your house would be like

200
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:29,079
the way I could compare like the feel to

201
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,918
it if that makes any sense but a little

202
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:34,198
denser than that and um and yeah it's

203
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,159
just it's it's it's it's a natural thing

204
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,079
people don't think it's natural

205
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,919
obviously the process of doing it isn't

206
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:42,000
but it it is essentially just rock

207
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:44,839
melted down and then spun um into this

208
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,360
very fibrous soft material uh and then

209
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:50,439
that's something that I found when I got

210
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,319
into it initially like you ask why the

211
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:54,598
why was again trying to figure out how I

212
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,759
could get away from soil and so I tried

213
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:58,639
cocoa and it's like all right well this

214
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,280
is basically just a not soil soil and

215
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,240
and it's still heavy and it's still it's

216
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,038
still messy it's still dirty it's still

217
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,000
a process that I just don't want to do

218
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,399
how could I get clean like to me that's

219
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,639
the whole point if if you're going to go

220
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:13,318
through the hurdle of setting up an

221
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,000
indoor grow then you and it's all about

222
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,120
cleanliness indoor I mean indoor you

223
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,199
have to extra be careful with what you

224
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,000
do so to me how can I avoid having soil

225
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,639
like doing dryb backs with soil and now

226
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,439
we have dry dust essentially so you know

227
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,280
dirt that's going to naturally get into

228
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,800
the HVAC and get into the de system and

229
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,478
get into your fans and your filters

230
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,200
because it's just dry dirt that's what's

231
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,158
going to happen you know and Coco

232
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,200
similar and you know sure there's like

233
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:39,399
pellets and other things you can do but

234
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,278
you know and I think when you get to

235
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:44,200
that point it's just preference but with

236
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:46,000
pellets I find that when I tried that it

237
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,200
didn't make sense for the root mass I

238
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,360
like the fact that the roots will

239
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,519
actually penetrate through the the

240
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,919
growan you know the rock wool and so

241
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,639
yeah that's kind of how I got to it was

242
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:57,719
you know you you can pot an entire room

243
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:59,039
we also pot which is something that I

244
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,680
don't feel is necessarily common

245
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,838
practice with people that grow on hydro

246
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:05,000
but um when we pot you know you can run

247
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:07,680
through an entire room of pots several

248
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,360
hundred very quickly and it's it's not a

249
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,278
lot of weight it's not hurting it's not

250
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,919
like the whole crew isn't like dreading

251
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:14,919
the day of transplant like you do when

252
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:18,199
you do soil or cocoa you know it's it's

253
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:20,399
a very very easy friendly thing to

254
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,399
utilize in my opinion got it so yeah

255
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,320
there's a handful of benefits there on

256
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,159
the flip side what would you say some of

257
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,399
the downsides of using Rockwell is uh

258
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,278
you have to be on top of your wall

259
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,759
watering if at any point you you lack on

260
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:36,480
your watering that's it your plants are

261
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,720
dead there's really no buffer um and

262
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,399
also in regards to buffer from a

263
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,240
nutrient standpoint there's no buffer

264
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,240
you know the benefit of soil especially

265
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,440
when you're a beginning grower is that

266
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,039
the plant the soil has you know like the

267
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,000
way I like to tell people that grow in

268
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:52,679
soil which I'm not a soil King by any

269
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,799
means I I know probably less than 1%

270
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:56,958
about soil but the little bit I do know

271
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,278
is that you know essentially you're

272
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,919
never feeding the plant you're really

273
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:02,159
feeding the soil and the soil is feeding

274
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,759
the plant you know so because of that

275
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,679
the soil has its own ecosystem and its

276
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:09,319
own pH and its own EC so it will act as

277
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,719
a buffer if you the beginner grower mess

278
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,879
something up you know you don't have

279
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,399
that buffer at all zero when it comes to

280
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,600
hydro um if you do one wrong feed and

281
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,320
it's wrong enough your plants are dead

282
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,920
you know you could maybe attempt to

283
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,920
bring them back but if you do something

284
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:25,360
bad enough they're dead and you know the

285
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,319
same could be said for soil but that bad

286
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,480
enough would have to be much worse than

287
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,160
it would be you know if it was Hydro so

288
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,000
so yeah I think I think the downsides

289
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,439
are that the there's no buffer there for

290
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,600
watering there's no buffer there for

291
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,480
nutrients um you have to really be spot

292
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,079
on on what you do and then how does

293
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,278
growing in Rockwell compare to other

294
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:47,078
methods of growing such as soil

295
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:50,200
hydroponic systems cocoa in terms of

296
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:53,039
yield and quality I mean so the quality

297
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,920
thing is I'm a firm believer that you're

298
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,599
a good grower if you can grow good in

299
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:58,919
any medium you know and it doesn't mean

300
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,159
anything other than that like there's no

301
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:04,319
need to deep into it when we talk yields

302
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:06,679
when we talk you know the end result a

303
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,200
lot of that's PR like it's all it's all

304
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:11,799
subjective it's all objective it's all

305
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,720
preference it's it's there's so many

306
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,000
variables to that so it's to me if you

307
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,639
can just show me a finished product that

308
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,480
doesn't hurt my throat that has a great

309
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,879
nose to it that tastes good that's

310
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,440
enjoyable all around you know I don't

311
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,759
really care too much about the bag ofo

312
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,160
but bonus if it's there you know it's

313
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:27,519
it's like that's what I care about and

314
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,039
then after that we can talk about how

315
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,720
you grew it because that's to me a

316
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,078
second secondary you know people get so

317
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,200
wrapped up in how it's like just smoke

318
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:37,039
it if it's good and you enjoy it then

319
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,040
it's good and you enjoy it like don't

320
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:43,480
let the fact that they grew inorganic or

321
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:46,799
organic or in salts or in soil or

322
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,159
whatever don't don't don't let that play

323
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,919
into what you think about it just try

324
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:52,319
the end result first and then work

325
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,919
backwards from that and figure out what

326
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,560
they did a lot of people assume I grow

327
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,559
soil or organic you know or living soil

328
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,119
or no till or all these famous catchy

329
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,679
phrases that are popping up in the last

330
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,320
five years so it's like when I tell

331
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,039
people nope none of that you know I'm

332
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,680
proud to say that I grow in salts I'm

333
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,078
proud to say that I grow hydroponically

334
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:13,799
and I'm proud to say that I figured out

335
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:15,879
a way to grow quality flower without all

336
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,399
the backbreaking work of soil like I'm I

337
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:19,000
just keep going back to that I'm a lazy

338
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,000
dude

339
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
bro yeah I know quite a few people who

340
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,360
say that the yield is better you know

341
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
you're going to get a higher yield you

342
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,199
kind of got more control over the the

343
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,159
nutrients pH you got to kind of be

344
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:32,679
bought on but you can achieve a higher

345
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,799
yield and as far as quality you talked

346
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:36,599
about flavor and stuff and kind of

347
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:39,000
comparing and stuff I've got a lot of

348
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,040
your stuff right here and uh you were

349
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,198
nice enough to gift it to me and every

350
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,919
single one of these is very flavorful so

351
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:48,000
like the papaya syrup is just it's my

352
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:50,759
favorite it's incredible aw there's a

353
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,078
big debate on Pon growing organically

354
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:54,838
versus growing with synthetic nutrients

355
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:56,919
and the flavor profiles and all that

356
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,279
stuff right now it's really just debate

357
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:01,319
you can definitely still get flavor and

358
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,679
proof right here still get flavor from

359
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,120
growing in synthetic nutrients

360
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:06,519
particularly in your style with growing

361
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,560
in Rockwell so fig I'd mention that one

362
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:12,078
I appreciate that yeah man I mean you

363
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:16,000
know I've done labs and and 100% Labs

364
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:18,638
show that in my experience a and being

365
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,679
between like say a 600 watt Dita high

366
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:24,240
pressure sodium vers the fluence LEDs

367
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:27,519
that I use right I use a 630 watt

368
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,680
fluence versus a 600 watt HPS way back

369
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,360
7even eight years ago when I really

370
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,958
started trying to compare an A and B and

371
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,360
figure out if LEDs were better you know

372
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,239
at that time they were better you know

373
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,839
because the labs would show that okay

374
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,159
cool this genetic oh granted there's

375
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:41,680
other environmental factors that play

376
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,759
into this but assuming you can get your

377
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,759
environments roughly close each time

378
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:49,519
right then your lab shouldn't skew too

379
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:52,439
much but there there'll be differences

380
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:56,440
but when it goes from say you know

381
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,639
1.7% turine profile on a dry cured plant

382
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,519
When I Grow It In A gavita and then I

383
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,680
grow that same plant under a fluence and

384
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,078
all of a sudden I have 2.4 2.6 2.8%

385
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:10,559
turine profiles that's not a little

386
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:13,359
difference that's like a 60 70 80%

387
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,919
difference in tpine content so it's like

388
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,000
that's undeniable and when you do that

389
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:18,838
for so many labs and so many plants and

390
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,399
you do run that through several

391
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,040
different genetics and you a and be it

392
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,720
against the high pressure sodium versus

393
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:25,599
the fluence it's like no I mean

394
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,040
historically speaking in my experience

395
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,560
with the labs I've paid to get done

396
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,719
independently yes there are higher

397
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,879
turpine profiles in in LEDs at least our

398
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,079
LEDs but I'm also not a person that's

399
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:38,480
going to sit here like most people do

400
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:42,120
and be like well that you know LEDs suck

401
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,720
or hpss suck or no bro it's again it's

402
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,919
preference just because you get a lower

403
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,000
tpine profile if when I smell the plant

404
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:51,519
I like it you did great bro so people

405
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,839
get so wrapped up in the data and that's

406
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,720
cool when you're trying to develop your

407
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,759
your way of your processes but it's not

408
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,680
cool to wrap up the end consumer and all

409
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,039
that data because then they're driven by

410
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:03,559
something that they don't fully

411
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,480
understand as opposed to just being

412
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,599
driven by their senses which is the best

413
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,600
thing you could do smell taste touch we

414
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,159
eat food with our eyes before we ever

415
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,320
taste it you know what I mean if

416
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,120
something comes to you and it looks

417
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,320
disgusting like sewage because it's

418
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,000
spinach based you it may be the greatest

419
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,000
dish on Earth but it looks like sewage

420
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,839
and you're probably not going to want to

421
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,679
eat it or you're going to have a

422
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:24,839
negative condensation to it right from

423
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:26,758
the junp so there's no difference to me

424
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,199
with plants and people understanding or

425
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,079
wanting to get fed to science to get in

426
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:33,039
the way of your based instinct which is

427
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:35,359
just how does it smell how does it taste

428
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,799
you know it's like let's just go back to

429
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,919
that you know and let the Growers worry

430
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:39,679
about all this nonsense that we're

431
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,759
trying to have a conversation about yeah

432
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,879
I totally what you mean when it comes

433
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:44,800
down to preference right Different

434
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:47,439
Strokes for different folks yeah now I

435
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:50,719
want to jump backwards to get into the

436
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,639
initial planting in Rockwell so how do

437
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,160
you properly prepare and condition

438
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,560
Rockwall before planting seeds or clones

439
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:59,639
into it yeah so rock wall has a natural

440
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:02,799
higher pH so it I believe it sits

441
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:04,600
somewhere around like 75 77 something

442
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,318
like that at least the the grodan which

443
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,800
is the company that whose Rockall I

444
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:11,360
utilize um I believe it's somewhere in

445
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:13,479
the mid to high sevens so you actually

446
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,318
uh will essentially just get a big you

447
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,839
know like 100 gallons of water pH of

448
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:20,278
water down to 5.5 and then we'll drop

449
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,040
all of the blocks that we're using uh

450
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:24,318
into that water to soak for like a half

451
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:26,078
hour to an hour and essentially what

452
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:28,559
that does is it brings that pH level

453
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,799
down to more of a neutral pH of around

454
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,638
six 62 to 65 somewhere in that range

455
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,198
which is safe for for younger plants and

456
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:36,440
then yeah that's it you know you

457
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,719
essentially just have to excuse me you

458
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,680
just just have to condition the plant or

459
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,120
condition the the the medium to receive

460
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,879
a plant but that's it it's super easy

461
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,360
and then the cool thing with that is you

462
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,240
don't have to saturate afterwards like

463
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,519
with soil a lot of times you'll have to

464
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,959
you know you'll you'll kind of dampen

465
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,120
the soil then you'll plant your seed

466
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,278
then you'll cover it or you plant your

467
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,720
clone or whatever and then you'll go

468
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,838
back and rewater the soil you not even

469
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,839
have to do that because you just did

470
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,079
that soaking process so it kind of also

471
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,319
removes a step just just in an act of

472
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:05,119
having to do that so yeah pull it out

473
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:07,240
put it in a tray if it's a clone or put

474
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,719
it into a block if it's a if it's a

475
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,160
clone going into a block or whatever

476
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,000
stage of life is with all of the the

477
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,160
rockel you have to you have to condition

478
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,640
it if you will and get the pH correct

479
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,279
and then from there you just put

480
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,600
whatever you're going to put it into and

481
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:22,798
then as that is a Seedling or a clone

482
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:25,038
that's rooting what techniques do you

483
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,318
use to encourage strong root growth in

484
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,440
rock wool I mean for one I definitely

485
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:31,038
use clonex I'm not a person says you

486
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,440
have to there's been plenty of times

487
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:34,400
where I've gone and need to take cuts

488
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,640
and didn't realize I was out or

489
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,240
something like that we take the cuts

490
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,400
anyways because the cuts got to be taken

491
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,960
you know so but ideally I use CLX if I

492
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,360
can because it just it has a rooting

493
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,759
hormone and it also kind of just helps

494
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:47,879
when you make a cut if we're talking in

495
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,038
Cuts Not seeds it it helps when you make

496
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,360
that incision and that cut line to just

497
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:52,519
sterilize it make sure there's no

498
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,279
infection that's going to get into it

499
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:55,720
and then also give it some hormones and

500
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:58,119
something to Kickstart that rooting

501
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,400
process um outside of that nothing you

502
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:03,599
know it's just you know I go into the

503
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,679
1.5 in AIS which are the Clone cubes

504
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,158
that we use um and yeah I mean the

505
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:10,280
conditioning of it is is really that

506
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:13,200
simple and as far as seeds go I'll

507
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:16,038
usually put I do the the cup Tech where

508
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,679
I'll just pH some water to like 65 uh

509
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:20,839
some R to 65 and I'll just drop the

510
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:23,559
seeds into a solo cup let them sit for

511
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:25,158
usually just one day and they'll crack

512
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:27,558
sometimes two days but never more than

513
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,400
two days you know it's and then as soon

514
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:31,359
as they split and I see the little

515
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,280
um tap rout I'll just take them place

516
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:36,199
them out tap rout down and pop them in

517
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,839
one by one individually into the same

518
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,440
1.5 inch AIS so rather I'm doing clones

519
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:43,678
or seeds it's always the 1.5 inch AIS so

520
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,759
the clonex that you use are you just

521
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,400
dipping the cutting into that or are you

522
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,279
doing a soak of the rock wall with the

523
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,759
clonic solution no there's some people

524
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:54,359
that do that um but no I just do

525
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:55,960
strictly water and then I just have a

526
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:58,000
little shock glass that I'll pour some

527
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,279
clonex gel into and just dip each clone

528
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,599
in and

529
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,240
yeah super easy and then what are you

530
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,879
using for a nutrient lineup and how do

531
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,038
you go about feedings throughout the

532
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,600
growth cycle yeah so the company we use

533
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:11,679
is current Solutions so that's another

534
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,240
little uh thing that's slightly

535
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,559
different about us is that most people

536
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,279
have never heard of our nutrient line

537
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:17,678
and that's because it's made by a

538
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:20,240
company called current culture and

539
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,400
current culture specializes in dwc which

540
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,279
is deep water culture um so deep water

541
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,519
culture without going into that too much

542
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,558
it's it's a totally different

543
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:30,480
methodology of growing where your plants

544
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:33,000
are are essentially constantly suspended

545
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,679
in water similar to aeroponics but

546
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,480
aeroponics utilizes misting at at

547
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,480
certain you know intervals whereas with

548
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,960
with dwc the roots are literally

549
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,839
suspended in water 247 and the way that

550
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,640
they don't root rot is through a process

551
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:48,439
called hyper oxygenation where they have

552
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,038
oxygen pumps that are essentially

553
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,720
pumping air into the water so much so

554
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:54,640
that the plants don't The Roots don't

555
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,159
realize that they're suspended in water

556
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,520
so you don't get that root rot you don't

557
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:59,280
get what would usually happen to

558
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:02,440
anything if it's sat in water for days

559
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:05,759
weeks months but um I utilize their

560
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,279
nutrient line in hydro which can be done

561
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,919
but it's definitely not the line's

562
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,918
designed for per se it's more designed

563
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,520
for the dwc um but yeah it's called

564
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,440
current solution it's a two-part there's

565
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,839
a a and a B for veg there's an A and A B

566
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,240
for Bloom uh they also have boosters if

567
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,119
you want uh depending on what we do I do

568
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,880
or don't use those um if we're growing

569
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:25,639
for flower I'll utilize the boosters to

570
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,039
get some more density if we're growing

571
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,038
for Ros and I do not utilize the

572
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:30,279
boosters and that's a whole another

573
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:32,879
conversation we have it another time but

574
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:35,720
um but yeah so yeah just a simple

575
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:39,200
two-part man and then as far as uh

576
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,919
regiment start out very very light um

577
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,240
there is a three there is a third part

578
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,440
to that like uh it's current Solutions

579
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,679
version of essentially a cow mag it's

580
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,080
it's called coco cow um but it's

581
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,880
basically just a a cow mag essentially

582
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,960
and so it'll be a cow mag and then the A

583
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,200
and the B uh when they're in clones uh

584
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,480
when I first take Cuts it'll be very

585
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,840
mild it'll be usually 1 mil per gallon

586
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,240
on the cow mag and one mil per gallon on

587
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:06,879
the v&amp;b until I see Roots form and at

588
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,798
that point I'll up the cow mag to two

589
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,278
Mills and I'll keep the veg at one um

590
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:12,960
until I'm ready to essentially start

591
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:14,919
acclimating them and once I acclimate

592
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,480
them then I'll start slowly each week

593
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:19,600
working up the feed but our feeds change

594
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,599
weekly from the from the day we take the

595
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,240
Clone until the day we harvest the plant

596
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:25,158
we don't ever have the same feed for two

597
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,200
weeks in a row are you measuring like

598
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,200
the EC or you have a TDS tester to

599
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,759
measure like a PPM and are you going off

600
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,240
of that or you just kind of looking at

601
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,759
the feeding chart and kind of using that

602
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,200
and not touching the EC or PPM Nei I'm

603
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:41,839
not looking at the PPM not looking at

604
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:44,759
the EC and um I'm also not going off of

605
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:46,678
any D anything data related 100% of how

606
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:50,000
I feed is strictly based on how the

607
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,480
plant responds um I try to demystify

608
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,640
whenever I talk to people man I really

609
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,120
do try to

610
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,120
demystify the growing for people I think

611
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,000
that everybody should grow you know I

612
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,319
really do and know people like why would

613
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,640
you say that it's bad for B it's great

614
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,278
for business I don't I'm not looking I'm

615
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,679
trying to sell seeds I don't you know

616
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:06,960
like so in my business the more people

617
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,519
that grow the better it is you know I'm

618
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,960
trying to sell tissue cultures I'm

619
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:12,839
trying to show people that growing for

620
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,120
yourself is good because once you smoke

621
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:16,399
your own thing you'll never want to

622
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,678
smoke anybody else's again and you may

623
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,159
have had better stuff but there's

624
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,278
something rewarding about doing it

625
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:23,520
yourself that is unexplainable unless

626
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:26,440
you do it you know and it's it's I I

627
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,679
encourage it so so yeah okay so yeah I

628
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,278
think that's probably a little shock

629
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,480
factor for some people people seeing

630
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:32,798
that you're a little bit hands off when

631
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,159
it comes to EC PPM and following a

632
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,480
feeding chart I imagine to begin you you

633
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,840
probably had some struggles right and

634
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,599
then you kind of figured it out over

635
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:42,720
time repetitive and getting the

636
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:44,558
experience now you grow healthy plants

637
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,600
every time I assume because every when I

638
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,798
went to your grow space man everything

639
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:50,639
was healthy like everything thank there

640
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:53,918
wasn't a deficiency

641
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:58,240
anywhere I appreciate that bro thank you

642
00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:01,080
um yeah so I guess it's because I I try

643
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,240
like was saying I I demystify it so I

644
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:05,480
utilize a lot of principles that nature

645
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,079
would utilize even though I'm indoor and

646
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,880
even though I'm using salts as people

647
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:11,759
like to say I really hate that term um

648
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,960
we could dig into that later but I'm I'm

649
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:17,200
not a fan of that I'm not a fan of

650
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,360
people uh miseducative people and trying

651
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,000
to say that salts are bad or somehow

652
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:23,798
unhealthy for people that's that's it's

653
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,278
crazy talk it's absolutely crazy talk

654
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:29,558
but

655
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:33,359
um no I I think that taking approaches

656
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:35,720
to Growing that mimic nature as much as

657
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:39,759
possible will always result in a better

658
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,319
end product and and so I just yes in the

659
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,119
beginning I screwed up some plants

660
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:44,759
because I didn't understand exactly what

661
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,278
they wanted in in relation to

662
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:49,158
specifically the nutrient line I use but

663
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:51,038
you know then you find a range over time

664
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:52,520
and you go okay cool like 80% of

665
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,240
anything I grow is going to probably be

666
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:56,119
fine within this range you know and then

667
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,919
it's like cool we'll have the outliers

668
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:59,359
and they'll show signs you know if we

669
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,840
get burning all right we got to back it

670
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,038
off a little bit if we get yellowing all

671
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,480
we got to increase it a little bit you

672
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:07,079
know I'm broadly speaking but it really

673
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,519
is kind of that simple you know and and

674
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:12,119
so yes I don't focus on EC or PPM

675
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:14,798
because it's it's again I'm not a fan of

676
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:16,158
putting that much science to it I'll put

677
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,278
that much science to getting my

678
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,520
environment correct and getting the

679
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:23,159
humidity dial to where I can have it

680
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:24,480
within a one or two% of exactly where I

681
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:26,679
want it all the time same with

682
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,079
temperatures you know but outside of

683
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:31,559
that no when it comes to the feed in my

684
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:34,678
opinion the

685
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:37,440
more within a range the

686
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:40,159
more inconsistent you are with your

687
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,880
feeds the better the plant will respond

688
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,960
to that and overall the more trione

689
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,320
production you will develop and overall

690
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,120
the higher tpes and flavonoids and

691
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:52,480
cannaboids you'll get from doing that

692
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:55,000
and the reason being is that because in

693
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,319
nature the plants produce tricomes as

694
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,880
when they're stressed you know for

695
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:00,079
various reasons there's so many reasons

696
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,240
the plants stress in nature to create

697
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:05,359
triome production but all all that to be

698
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,399
said the thing that we enjoy about the

699
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:09,398
plant is the essential oils that are in

700
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:10,678
those Tricom heads and those Tricom

701
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:13,439
heads are formed through various

702
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:16,080
stresses you know so if you can induce

703
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,240
certain stresses by not letting the

704
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:21,278
plant get comfortable and complacent by

705
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,240
having the same exact feed every single

706
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:24,839
day and it knowing that at 10:00 a.m.

707
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,960
when your lights come on they're getting

708
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:29,519
watered you know maybe instead 4 days a

709
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,319
week you water it exactly when you want

710
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:32,599
to water but then those other three days

711
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:34,558
maybe one day you water an hour and a

712
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:36,359
half late maybe the other day you water

713
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:38,079
3 hours late maybe the other day you

714
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:40,199
don't water until you see the plants

715
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,278
just starting to have a full dryback and

716
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,319
want a droop on you then you water and

717
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:45,159
then the rest of the week you go back to

718
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:46,720
water in the same time you know and when

719
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:48,360
you do things like that and when you

720
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,839
don't worry about your ppms being the

721
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:51,599
same and you don't worry about your EC

722
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:55,079
being the same and you're okay with your

723
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:57,278
pH fluctuating maybe 0 2 or3 which a lot

724
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:59,398
of people think that's a lot it's not it

725
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,398
is more in hydr than it is soil but it's

726
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:03,158
still not a lot and especially if you

727
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:05,319
only pick one or two days a week to do

728
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:08,120
that like those little things are what

729
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:09,678
create a better product overall because

730
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:11,239
you're allowing the plant to have the

731
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,919
same types of natural stresses it would

732
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,038
have in nature I was going to ask you

733
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:18,320
about pH next now you already mentioned

734
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:19,759
5.5 pH for 30 to 60 Minutes soak to

735
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,918
begin and then that's going to end up

736
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:25,200
about 6.2 6.5 pH but how about the

737
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:28,640
remaining parts of the grow like the veg

738
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,360
flower are you aiming for a specific p

739
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,278
of the nutrient solution yes yeah so

740
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,038
when we're in clones I aim for between

741
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:37,919
62 and 64 when we get into vegging

742
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:39,558
meaning clones are acclimated and we're

743
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,919
transplanting them and we do three

744
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:43,480
transplants essentially so we go clone

745
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,600
into the first transplant which is an

746
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,880
aoke Cube and then we go those those 1.5

747
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:51,839
inch AIS into 4 inch I forgot what they

748
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,278
call them the six inches or the hugos I

749
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:56,720
forgot what they the name is for the 4

750
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:58,240
Ines but we go into a 4x4x4 block right

751
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,720
and then from there we go into a three G

752
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,960
gallon pot if it's a mom five gallon pot

753
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,399
but if it's something that's going into

754
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:07,360
production it's a three gallon pot um so

755
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:10,319
that's it and so at each stage of that

756
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:12,158
we change the PH range until we get into

757
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,558
flour and then we maintain a consistent

758
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,880
PH range for majority of flour so we

759
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:19,678
start out from 62 to 64 and then when we

760
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,278
get into the 4in cubes we go from 6 to

761
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,440
62 and then once we essentially are

762
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:26,599
ready to transplant into pots we'll keep

763
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,798
it at around that six and then over the

764
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:30,398
course of three or four weeks in once we

765
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:32,079
transplant into pots we'll usually

766
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:34,519
continue to veg for another 3 to four

767
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:38,599
weeks and then over that 3 or four weeks

768
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:41,359
we'll wean It Off from 6 6160 to roughly

769
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:42,759
5'8 and once we hit 5'8 we'll flip to

770
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,479
flower and then we'll start our

771
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:46,759
flowering and then we'll usually

772
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,558
maintain 5'8 until the very end of

773
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:52,519
flowering and we'll kick it down to 5'7

774
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:54,720
and that little tenth is it you'll get a

775
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:56,159
little bit more C again in our system I

776
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,200
can't speak to everything but in our

777
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,278
system we'll get a little bit more Tri

778
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,759
home production because then you're

779
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:04,278
getting pretty low in the pH which is

780
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:06,839
fine in Hydro but you are getting down

781
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:08,278
there so you'll start seeing that adds a

782
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:09,918
little bit of stress to the pl so we'll

783
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:11,079
get that little extra trione production

784
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,320
right at the end to just get that a

785
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:14,960
little bit of frost so yeah that's

786
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:17,519
that's it so I would say from broadly

787
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,960
speaking 64 to 57 would be our range

788
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:23,440
over the course of you know roughly the

789
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,759
14 to 16 weeks that that plant will be

790
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,558
alive from clone till Harvest got it now

791
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:31,119
have you ever encountered PE pH

792
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:34,200
fluctuations that has caused problems

793
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:37,239
with the plant's growth no no I mean if

794
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,798
you go crazy yeah of course but uh

795
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,440
everything's within range so I I find

796
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:44,839
that if you keep when we're talking when

797
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:48,200
we're talking pH if you can keep it

798
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:51,240
within 3.4 you're not going to hurt the

799
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,120
plant that is a big swing but it's it's

800
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,000
it's not going to hurt the plant so

801
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,599
something happens where maybe you didn't

802
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,480
calibrate your pH meter or something

803
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:00,879
like that and you are an extra a tenth

804
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,360
or two10 off in One Direction or the

805
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,320
other no you're fine it's not going to

806
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:07,079
do anything you'd have to do you'd have

807
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:10,200
to skew it pretty bad okay let's get

808
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:11,918
into water and irrigation strategy next

809
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,038
you kind of touched upon it a little bit

810
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,559
but I like to get a little bit more

811
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:17,759
detailed you already mentioned using R

812
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:21,480
water now I live in the same area that

813
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:24,278
you do the uh water out the to is 485

814
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,759
PPM almost unsafe to drink according to

815
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:29,440
EPA guidelines anything over 500 BPM is

816
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:31,879
unsafe yeah just below that but it's

817
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,640
very high in sodium

818
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,760
bicarbonates and my experience trying to

819
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,519
use that water that tap water is just

820
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:42,240
it's been unsuccessful you get lockouts

821
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:44,880
that happen and uh really raggedy plants

822
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,159
so I use reverse osmosis I know you use

823
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,840
reverse osmosis what do you do for an

824
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:55,159
irrigation strategy uh so yeah so we

825
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:57,678
just have a essentially a uh it's it's

826
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:59,120
really just a three stage but it's it's

827
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,080
technically a two-stage but we have a

828
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:04,278
pre-filter system because of how bad the

829
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:07,278
water is here so uh we go into a

830
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:10,119
pre-filter two stage that's a sediment

831
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:12,159
and a carbon filter uh and those two

832
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:14,959
kind of strip it down pretty good so

833
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,960
that my main R doesn't the membrane and

834
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,319
whatnot doesn't have to get replaced as

835
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,840
often I'm replacing the the pre-filter

836
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:23,398
every three months and that's that's

837
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:25,839
allowing me to not have to replace the

838
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:27,678
main filter usually for about a year

839
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:29,480
somewhere between 9 to 12 months I'll

840
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:33,120
I'll out of having to replace the main

841
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:35,440
filters um outside of that I mean yeah

842
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:38,199
once we go into once it comes out the RO

843
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,440
you know we store like I usually have

844
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,080
the try to store three days uh I've

845
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,120
found that if we can have three days of

846
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:47,439
backup usually within three days we can

847
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,439
fix any issues you know that's enough

848
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,960
time where if some a problem falls on a

849
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,360
weekend or something like that you know

850
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,480
and we can't get somebody out for a

851
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:56,839
Monday or something it's we're fine so I

852
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,440
store three days but and as far as uh

853
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:00,519
like irrigation we don't utilize

854
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,200
irrigation we hand waterer everything uh

855
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:05,120
which that's another thing that a lot of

856
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,880
people are kind of shocked about is that

857
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:09,678
you know we'll have you know 100 plus

858
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,600
lights going and it's all handw water

859
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,000
you know and people are like oh it's

860
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:15,759
inefficient it's this it's that you

861
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,720
could be better utilizing your time to

862
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,440
work on other aspects of the garden to

863
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,278
make the plants healthier I hear all the

864
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,399
arguments and a lot of that's I mean

865
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:24,679
quite frankly I I'll keep the swearing

866
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:27,518
to a minimum this will be the only one I

867
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:29,600
say it's [ __ ] it's just it's bull

868
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,278
you know it's it's nothing you know you

869
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:33,959
can run through a 100 lighter you can

870
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:35,919
have one employee run through water if

871
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,159
their sole job every day was to just

872
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:41,639
water plants one employee in an six hour

873
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:44,679
shift could run through 100 plus lights

874
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:47,079
you know so it's it's not over and and I

875
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:49,240
believe in doing that because it allows

876
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:51,558
you to put your eyes on every single

877
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,960
plant every single day there is nothing

878
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:54,599
that will get missed there's nothing

879
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,200
that will be overlooked there's nothing

880
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:58,398
that you won't see happening on one

881
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,600
random plant and also it allows not all

882
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:01,278
plants feed the same even if it's the

883
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:04,038
same genetic not all plants feed the

884
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:06,278
same if I have a hundred of 100 clones

885
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:07,480
of a given mom in a room not all 100 of

886
00:32:06,278 --> 00:32:09,159
those clones are going to feed the exact

887
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,440
same they're all going to uptake

888
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:11,880
slightly differently so it'll allow you

889
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,120
to see like oh you know what today I can

890
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,559
skip this plant this plant's not

891
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,719
drinking like the other 90 of its

892
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:18,278
cousins like you know it's just it

893
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,440
doesn't want water today you know so

894
00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:21,240
that's the other thing is it allows you

895
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,720
to kind of feel things out look at the

896
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,038
plants assess and determine if you

897
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,960
really even need to water that plant

898
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:28,599
that day and in Hydro I think that's

899
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,200
better cuz mats are a big thing in Hydro

900
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:33,398
Nats Nats I would say more in Hydro than

901
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,919
anything I've ever seen they're very

902
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:37,199
prominent that's because generally

903
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,919
speaking people that grow in Hydro do

904
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,840
utilize irrigation of some kind and that

905
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,200
irrigation keeps a constant moisture on

906
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:47,278
the block or the rock wall which allows

907
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,120
perfect environment for knats you know

908
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:51,798
so I don't do that we also hand water

909
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:53,038
because it allows us to do dry backs

910
00:32:51,798 --> 00:32:55,038
which is something that people think is

911
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:57,000
an absolute sin when you grow in hydro

912
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:59,038
and no bro you can totally do a dryback

913
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,398
it's all about just watching and just

914
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:03,000
tending to the plants and understanding

915
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:04,638
what they want and so we do promote dryb

916
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,240
backs we tell people yes you can dry

917
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:08,240
back in Hydro you know you should drive

918
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,960
back in Hydro yeah I know you're set up

919
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,798
utilize all these different trays and it

920
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,038
would be perfect for a flood and drain

921
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:15,319
and I assume that that was the case but

922
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:17,440
then I'm now I remembered that you said

923
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:21,038
you hand water everything now how do you

924
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,960
determine when to water though um so I

925
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:25,879
mean a lot of it just has to do with the

926
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,558
plants uptake you know I I don't I don't

927
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,440
stick to like a regiment if that makes

928
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:30,398
sense

929
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,440
um especially now when we're in veg once

930
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:38,599
we're in flour the way that we propagate

931
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:41,320
the rooms we it's we know when to flip

932
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:45,278
to flow from a size standpoint of the

933
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:48,599
plant where once we're in flour the

934
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:50,880
plant will drink every day where if we

935
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:54,000
didn't water it the following day it

936
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,080
would die but we try to not get to that

937
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,839
point until we're in flour um leading up

938
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:01,319
to that what when we first transplant

939
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:03,038
into the 4-in cubes um that initial

940
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:05,759
transplant day we won't water those

941
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:08,719
plants again the Clone into Cube or the

942
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,639
Clone into 4inch block that block being

943
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,358
soaked because there's no roots in it

944
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,878
yet because we just put it in there it

945
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:15,319
takes four or five days for those roots

946
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:17,440
to spread out into that block a little

947
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,559
bit so we won't water those clones for

948
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,760
four to five days until those blocks

949
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:23,480
fully dry out you know and then when we

950
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,159
do water it'll be a light watering I'm

951
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,918
not going to sit there and reatur those

952
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:28,679
blocks all the way fully because there's

953
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:30,918
still not a massive root mass in there

954
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,838
yet so like even when we do go back and

955
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:34,559
water it'll be a light water to make it

956
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:36,519
so that I don't have to water them every

957
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:37,960
day so that we again we can get the dryb

958
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:39,918
backs it's always about the dryb backs

959
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,320
because in Hydro knats are your worst

960
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,158
enemy and they are coming all of the

961
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,039
time so you know unless you want to

962
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,960
utilize crazy [ __ ] which I don't I just

963
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,960
you you dryb backs dryb backs are the

964
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,679
best way to try to to to fight those

965
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,559
especially in Hydro yeah definitely

966
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:57,079
helps with reducing the pests because if

967
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:58,838
you on the flip side if you keep the

968
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:00,519
moisture content too high you could have

969
00:34:58,838 --> 00:35:02,440
issues such as like overwatering

970
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:05,039
symptoms and root Rod right have you

971
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,679
ever come across those things no no

972
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,559
because we do it how we do it I mean uh

973
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:11,480
you know and I don't mean that at all in

974
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:13,920
a cocky way whatsoever but just because

975
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,280
we don't have irrigation and again not

976
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,838
to say people that grow with irrigation

977
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,440
are going to screw themselves and and

978
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:20,679
it's a no no win scenario it's not true

979
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,440
there are people running millions of

980
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:24,078
lights across this country right now

981
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,159
doing irrigation drip systems that are

982
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,240
completely fine but that being said like

983
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:30,279
yeah I

984
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:32,039
um no I've never ran into a root Rod

985
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,720
there's no there's no ability for it to

986
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:37,000
happen you know in in the way we do it

987
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:38,879
got it one thing that can show up on the

988
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,480
Rockwell cubes that we actually had a

989
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,559
conversation last time I I was over

990
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,880
there we talked about the algae that's

991
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:47,679
on there and uh I think there

992
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,160
misconceptions about algae yeah break it

993
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:52,919
down for us talk to us all about algae

994
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:54,799
being on Rockwell is it harmful or

995
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,838
harmless what's your experience with

996
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,280
that yeah completely harmless it's uh it

997
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:01,400
just doesn't look good you know people

998
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,160
want to see the the rockel and it's

999
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,358
pristine so a lot of people will get the

1000
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:08,039
plastic inserts that go over so you know

1001
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:10,559
the sun can't hit it but algae when

1002
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:12,838
we're talking specific Plants algae is

1003
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,559
completely harmless it it does nothing

1004
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,078
it does ACT annoying because it creates

1005
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,559
like a little barrier on the top where

1006
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,000
like you'll have to water like an extra

1007
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:21,480
couple of seconds to penetrate through

1008
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,519
the algae outside of that it absolutely

1009
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,679
does nothing it's it's it's very it's

1010
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:29,960
common anywhere that you have Water and

1011
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:31,838
Light constant Water and Light algae

1012
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,079
will form it'll do it in a fish tank

1013
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,400
it'll do it in a pool it'll do it

1014
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,000
anywhere that's why we use chlorine in

1015
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,720
pools that's why we use you know

1016
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,119
cleaners and scrubbers and fish tanks

1017
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:43,159
and other fish to specifically eat algae

1018
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,559
in nature nature figures out its own way

1019
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:47,480
to handle algae but you know there's we

1020
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:49,799
could do it but now we're adding

1021
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,039
different things that don't need to be

1022
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,359
mixed into the plants just for the sake

1023
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:55,800
of taking out something that's already

1024
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:57,358
harmless for the plant anyways so yeah

1025
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,560
it's just a lot of people look at it

1026
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:01,679
like my God is that no just algae it's

1027
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:03,199
no big deal calm down but yeah it's

1028
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,159
nothing it's no big deal at all I think

1029
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:07,679
the only time it would be potentially a

1030
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:09,480
problem is if you see it on soil and

1031
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,039
your plant is struggling right then you

1032
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,318
could potentially have an overwatering

1033
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:14,440
symptom that happens and that happened

1034
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:16,358
to me before where it's like seeing that

1035
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,358
little bit of allergy growth on there

1036
00:37:16,358 --> 00:37:19,920
look up at the plant and be like uhoh

1037
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:21,679
looks like it's a little bit overwatered

1038
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,358
so that might be an indication if you're

1039
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:25,199
in soil to kind of back off on things

1040
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:26,838
but this is something that is in Jeff

1041
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,039
lenell's book I'm not sure if you read

1042
00:37:26,838 --> 00:37:31,239
teaming with microbes no probably not

1043
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,880
cuz I know you're not a soil guy but

1044
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:35,199
he's very in depth about utilizing

1045
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,200
microbes and growing plants and stuff

1046
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:40,279
like that he has a whole chapter a

1047
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:42,199
section on algae and it talks about how

1048
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,680
really it breaks down to like silica and

1049
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:45,279
so that's that's a non-essential element

1050
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:47,519
for the plant so it's actually can be

1051
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,640
beneficial so yeah I figur I'd bring up

1052
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:51,599
algae because uh I know it's a common

1053
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:53,759
misconception when it comes to growing

1054
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,359
in Rockwell yep yeah and it's in

1055
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,800
everybody's I mean I've never seen a

1056
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:57,880
garden in Rockwell that doesn't have it

1057
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,000
unless they're using those little

1058
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,280
plastic inserts that go over the blocks

1059
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,440
I've seen in my humidifier before and

1060
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,280
again like you mentioned that the

1061
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,200
sunlight does it on the water and it

1062
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,440
could algae can form and you obviously

1063
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:11,799
have to go in there and clean it and

1064
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,079
stuff I had a pool and I had to manage

1065
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,640
my pool and you get algae blooms that

1066
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,519
come up and what do you do well there

1067
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:19,679
are products that you can buy to get rid

1068
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:22,199
of algae really what what feeds the

1069
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:24,759
algae is phosphorus and particular like

1070
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:26,799
talking about me I just think about me

1071
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,720
managing my swimming pool there was a

1072
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,680
product called L free which you put in

1073
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:33,118
once a week and then you obviously you

1074
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:34,639
remove the plant material that's you

1075
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,318
know the Fallen debris that comes in the

1076
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:39,039
pool remove all that because that's just

1077
00:38:36,318 --> 00:38:40,800
feeding the algae so um anyways yeah

1078
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:43,000
it's funny how this all relates yeah

1079
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,640
there's correlations everywhere it's and

1080
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,400
that's the thing is again going back to

1081
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:50,799
wanting to demystify it there the

1082
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:53,920
correlations between humans and plants

1083
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,680
are insane the correlations between how

1084
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,760
humans reproduce and plants are insane

1085
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:01,719
you know there's it's endless like it

1086
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,720
really is an ecosystem that isn't

1087
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:07,159
different than ours it actually fits

1088
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:08,879
into ours you know it's it's pretty cool

1089
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:11,078
next let's get into environment

1090
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,838
conditions what do you typically aim for

1091
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:16,039
for temperature relative humidity do you

1092
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:19,960
supplement CO2 if so what do you aim for

1093
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:22,400
there uh it all changes yes yes and yes

1094
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,440
um so early on in life like when we're

1095
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,160
talking clones before they're acclimated

1096
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:29,039
we're obviously throwing them into trays

1097
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:32,920
with domes ideally keeping them around

1098
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:36,480
84 85 86 degrees with hopefully as close

1099
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:38,920
to 100% humidity as possible um and then

1100
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,240
once they're acclimated ideally I want

1101
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:45,440
my Nursery to be somewhere between you

1102
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:49,159
know 82 to again 84 85 degrees with

1103
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,880
roughly 70% humidity um and then once we

1104
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:53,279
get into blocks and we start

1105
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,400
transitioning to closer to them being in

1106
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,880
pots uh you

1107
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:02,440
know mid 60s to the 70s and you know low

1108
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,838
70s in in humidity and you know maybe

1109
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:08,760
creeping down into the high 70s at night

1110
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:11,119
but still maintaining around 80 to 82 uh

1111
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,640
in temperatures when the lights are on

1112
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,318
uh and then once we get into pots over

1113
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:20,440
the course of vegging I'll get the room

1114
00:40:15,318 --> 00:40:23,440
basically down to roughly 78 79 degrees

1115
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,280
uh and around the mid to low 60s and

1116
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,679
then once we start flowering for the

1117
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,319
first 3 to four weeks of flowering I'll

1118
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:33,039
maintain in the low 60s and humidity and

1119
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:35,039
I'll maintain the high 70s uh and then

1120
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,880
as flowering progresses once sight's

1121
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,719
actually form that's when I'll start

1122
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,318
weaning everything off um now the

1123
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:43,399
exception to that is if I'm growing for

1124
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:46,960
rosin uh when I'm growing for rosin I do

1125
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:49,119
not wean off humidity um that's another

1126
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,920
conversation but to stick to flour I

1127
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,559
will wean off humidity and temps

1128
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,920
throughout the course of the rest of the

1129
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,838
flower and time of that plant um and so

1130
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,800
by the end when I'm you know in flush

1131
00:40:56,838 --> 00:40:59,519
per se

1132
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,599
I'll probably be somewhere in the range

1133
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:05,800
when the lights are on of around 68 67

1134
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:10,318
69 somewhere in that range temperature-

1135
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:13,800
wise and roughly about 50% humidity um

1136
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:15,759
again for flour uh and then yeah when

1137
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:20,599
the lights are off that'll get down to

1138
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:22,920
probably 58 59 in temperature um and

1139
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:25,680
humidity same roughly around 50% you

1140
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:28,440
know uh and then when it's verzin we'll

1141
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:31,559
dip the temps but not as crazy I'll go

1142
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:34,800
down to maybe like 72 73 when the lights

1143
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:37,719
are on and maybe 66 67 when the lights

1144
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,640
are off but I will maintain the humidity

1145
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:43,358
in the mid to high 60s um because you

1146
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:46,000
end up with a more resinous plant um and

1147
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:48,960
when you can maintain above 50% even if

1148
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,920
you go 51% if you can just maintain

1149
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,199
above

1150
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,440
50% uh humidity relative humidity then

1151
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:58,239
naturally you're going to have less off

1152
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,760
gassing of tpen and and and things on

1153
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,399
the plant and essential oils just kind

1154
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,160
of doing their thing so you know temps

1155
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,639
yes drop because that slows off gasing

1156
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:09,199
uh but humidity keep it higher you know

1157
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:11,039
when we're talking for resin production

1158
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:13,159
or rosin production and then how about

1159
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:15,119
CO2 you're supplementing there are you

1160
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:17,399
measuring the PPM that's in the

1161
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,119
environment yeah now that's something we

1162
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,200
will use yeah that's a time where I will

1163
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:24,559
use PPM this

1164
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:25,960
year yeah so do you aim for for

1165
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:29,040
different ppms throughout the different

1166
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,720
stages of growth so early on uh just

1167
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:32,960
natural atmosphere is usually enough to

1168
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,399
take care of the Clones so you know most

1169
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,000
atmospheres around where we're at is

1170
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,160
somewhere in a range of 400 to you know

1171
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,400
between 350 and say 500 is what the

1172
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:43,920
natural atmosphere is so that's plenty

1173
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,400
fine for clones uh once we get into

1174
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,519
blocks and they're not in domes anymore

1175
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,480
uh I'll start introducing CO2 at roughly

1176
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:56,199
around 550 parts per million um so not

1177
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:59,240
much higher than natural atmosphere um

1178
00:42:56,199 --> 00:43:01,519
and they'll stay there until we go into

1179
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:04,639
pots once we go into pots I'll kick it

1180
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:07,440
up about 650 and then every week that

1181
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:09,879
I'm in vge in pots which is usually four

1182
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,838
four weeks for most strains I'll kick it

1183
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:17,880
up a 100 so week one a veg I'll be at

1184
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:19,279
say 650 750 850 and at 950 like usually

1185
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,760
at the end of that week or sometimes at

1186
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,480
the start of that week depending on the

1187
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,480
size of the plants that's when I'll flip

1188
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,358
to flower um and then from flower I

1189
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,880
found like we've pushed it as high as is

1190
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:31,440
you know 1900 2000 at certain points of

1191
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,960
us just trying to see what would stress

1192
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,000
the plants out and they were fine like

1193
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,000
you I found that you really have to kick

1194
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,400
it pretty high like you need to get

1195
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,639
really high almost where it's it's it's

1196
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,599
dangerous for humans you know you need

1197
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:45,879
to get around like four 5,000 PPM to

1198
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,800
really hurt the plant and and I mean

1199
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,800
it'll you can may be affect it less than

1200
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,599
that but there's no need to do it I

1201
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,920
didn't see a benefit in yield I didn't

1202
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,920
see a benefit in higher Tarpin or

1203
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,079
flavonoids or canono production when we

1204
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,400
would get it tested so um honestly when

1205
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,039
we're in flower now I keep it around

1206
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,358
1,200 and that's it I don't up it I

1207
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:06,719
don't down it I don't change it once I'm

1208
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:09,119
in flush I'll usually cut off the CO2

1209
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:11,279
entirely um which again that's just an

1210
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,920
added stress to the plant it's it's

1211
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,119
little things like that where that last

1212
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:17,800
week of flush is just no CO2 whatsoever

1213
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:19,519
that room's going to deplete everything

1214
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,800
when I walk in the parts per will be

1215
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:23,800
around 80 or 100 which is basically

1216
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,200
suffocating the plant at that point and

1217
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,720
that's intentional you know because

1218
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:29,239
again it's an added stress right at the

1219
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:30,480
very into life you know just to it's no

1220
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:32,558
different than people doing that whole

1221
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,280
three days of dark thing which I'm I

1222
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,359
don't necessarily agree with just

1223
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,519
because it's not really whatever it's

1224
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:39,440
neither here nor there it's just

1225
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:41,519
creating stress it's just same same

1226
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,159
concept I just do it through kind of

1227
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:44,920
suffocating them a little bit you know

1228
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:47,199
as opposed to just freaking them out for

1229
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,079
three days like you know I just kind of

1230
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:50,960
naturally let them deplete any CO2

1231
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:52,839
around them got it now you mentioned

1232
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,199
flush that's probably uh spark some

1233
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:56,838
people's interest when we you talk about

1234
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:59,199
flushing yeah you do flush at the end of

1235
00:44:56,838 --> 00:45:01,119
the grow cycle first of all what is your

1236
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:02,519
definition of flush because there are a

1237
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,838
couple different definitions some people

1238
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:07,199
think that flushing is running a large

1239
00:45:04,838 --> 00:45:09,159
amount of water through the medium other

1240
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,199
people consider flushing just stopping

1241
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:12,879
nutrients at a certain point what's your

1242
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:15,558
definition of flushing and how do you go

1243
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,920
about flushing uh so my definition of

1244
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:21,119
flushing is depleting the plant of any

1245
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:24,280
and all nutrients to the point where all

1246
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:27,480
that's left that it's uptaking is water

1247
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:30,280
essentially um so it's the being

1248
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,719
depleted of of any and everything

1249
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,160
because when you can deplete it like

1250
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:35,279
that that's going to make a much

1251
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:37,118
smoother smoke it's going to make a much

1252
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,800
better cure it's going to just make a

1253
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,838
much better end result of the plant you

1254
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,559
know that that quote unquote white ash

1255
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:45,039
that everybody you know chases which

1256
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:46,760
honestly is somewhat a myth that you

1257
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,880
know I don't really care to debunk but

1258
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,800
the white ash thing is kind of bull too

1259
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,400
but um you know for the people that want

1260
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,720
to chase that cool just flush your plant

1261
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,400
a lot and you'll get a white ash you

1262
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:58,719
know it's it's it's not guaranteed you

1263
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,039
also got to not be an idiot and grow and

1264
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:02,239
care about your plants throughout the

1265
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:04,039
whole point but if you cared about

1266
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,000
everything up to that point and then you

1267
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:08,079
flush on top of that to truly deplete

1268
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,880
the plant of any of its nutrients that

1269
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,760
it's going to have in the water leaves

1270
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,358
in the sugar leaves in the stock in the

1271
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,680
medium to where it's literally just

1272
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:17,799
water in the inside of that plant yeah

1273
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:20,039
you're going to get an I mean it's just

1274
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,559
common sense like if you had dirty water

1275
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:22,960
and you ran it through a charcoal filter

1276
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:24,480
and now of a sudden you have Crystal

1277
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,400
Clear clean water which one would you

1278
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,079
prefer to drink you know so for that

1279
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,039
same log which one would you prefer to

1280
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,079
smoke you know that's why I've always

1281
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:32,318
you know to be honest with you I've

1282
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,920
always had a beef with people that don't

1283
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:35,440
flush like a lot of soil Growers

1284
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,200
especially like the no till people and

1285
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,920
the living soil people they have this

1286
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:42,199
ideology you don't have to flush like

1287
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,318
nature doesn't flush and it's like no

1288
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:46,118
guys nature tills and nature flushes

1289
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:48,519
nature does flush that's what a monsoon

1290
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:50,119
season is and nature does till that's

1291
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:52,039
what animals are that's what storms are

1292
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:53,559
that's what wind is like you know that's

1293
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:56,440
what that's what a lot of things are

1294
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:58,960
like 100% soil gets tilled in nature you

1295
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,440
know and 100% there's insects there's

1296
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,800
worms there's things that are in the

1297
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,639
soil that are moving it around and

1298
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,039
tilling it you know and that's that's

1299
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:07,598
underneath on the surface 100% surface

1300
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:09,639
layers of soil are getting removed every

1301
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,559
year through Monsoon seasons and through

1302
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:12,960
just natural you know storms nature

1303
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:14,920
mother nature doing what Mother Nature

1304
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,159
does so yeah I'm a firm believer that

1305
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,559
there's no scenario whatsoever where you

1306
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:20,679
should not flush your plants I don't

1307
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,760
care what you grow in so to get to your

1308
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:25,239
goal of completely depleting the

1309
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,520
nutrition are you running a large amount

1310
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:28,239
of water through it or are you just

1311
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:30,519
cutting off nutrients and doing water

1312
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:32,919
only uh water only I'm cutting off

1313
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:34,239
nutrients doing water only uh initially

1314
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,358
like for the first couple of days of

1315
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:38,959
flush I will like say for conversation

1316
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:40,719
sake I water one gallon per plant um

1317
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,440
I'll Water three or four or five gallons

1318
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:45,519
I'll just sit there and soak the medium

1319
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,639
to try to just flush the medium itself

1320
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:48,838
out because it's it's a little more

1321
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:51,159
difficult with soil because soil wants

1322
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:53,039
to retain right but with Hydro it

1323
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:54,838
doesn't want to retain so if you just

1324
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:57,558
literally run water through the medium

1325
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:59,279
long enough you will rinse out all of

1326
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:01,079
what's whatever little deposits are

1327
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,160
still left in it so the first couple of

1328
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:06,000
days maybe few days I will just fully

1329
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:07,920
just oversaturate with water but still

1330
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,838
just once a day and still when of the

1331
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,000
lights first come on so that they have

1332
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:15,318
the next 23 hours to to to dry that out

1333
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,639
and get back to a dry period um I'm

1334
00:48:15,318 --> 00:48:18,119
definitely not trying to sit there and

1335
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:20,159
just keep the medium soaked for a week

1336
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:21,920
straight no but yeah the first couple of

1337
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:23,358
days I will weigh overw waterer the pots

1338
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,000
to literally just get them to the point

1339
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:26,279
where they're just flushing and then

1340
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,559
after that I'll just continue to water

1341
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,359
for another until I see yellowing

1342
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:31,599
happening you know once and not all

1343
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:33,440
genetics will do it there are some

1344
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,920
genetics where I flushed them for weeks

1345
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,639
and they just would not like after weeks

1346
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,559
they would finally start to give me a

1347
00:48:37,639 --> 00:48:41,558
little something it's like dude I know

1348
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:44,160
through Labs that I don't need to flush

1349
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:46,359
this long like Labs have shown me that

1350
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:47,838
past five days you're technically

1351
00:48:46,358 --> 00:48:49,078
passing any lab there will be nothing

1352
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:51,159
that's showing up on the parts per

1353
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:53,240
million or parts per billion in their

1354
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:55,399
given you know fields of where the the

1355
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:57,519
ranges are for safety or not so it's

1356
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:00,000
like after 5 days at least with our

1357
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:01,960
nutrients the way we do it we're safe so

1358
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,760
but I've gone two weeks just to see and

1359
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,798
there are a few genetics that won't fade

1360
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,040
but I I would say nine out of 10

1361
00:49:06,798 --> 00:49:10,480
genetics will show you a fade meaning

1362
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:13,199
that you'll start to see the plant from

1363
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,039
the tips like yellow out and you'll see

1364
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:17,279
the Green in the plant the chlorophyll

1365
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:18,440
start to deplete out of the plant and

1366
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,119
and it'll just start to have this

1367
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,838
beautiful fade some are more beautiful

1368
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:23,720
some are kind of ugly but you'll just

1369
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:25,358
have a fade happen and that's when you

1370
00:49:23,719 --> 00:49:26,919
know like yeah the plant's now basically

1371
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:28,199
starting to eat itself because there's

1372
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,960
nothing left there's no nutrients

1373
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:31,960
anywhere for it to absorb and then you

1374
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:34,039
could safely pull it understood yeah

1375
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,559
flushing is a super hot topic a lot of

1376
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:37,000
people like to talk about flushing and

1377
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:38,400
some people flush some people don't

1378
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,719
flush I'd love to know in the comment

1379
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,599
section below for those folks that are

1380
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:43,719
tuning into this on YouTube in

1381
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,880
particular comment below and let us know

1382
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:48,118
if you flush if so how do you go about

1383
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,480
it if you don't flush why don't you

1384
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:53,079
flush let us know let's spark some uh

1385
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,199
debate friendly debate in the comment

1386
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:57,240
section here I got a few more questions

1387
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:00,078
for you before I let you go I want to

1388
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:01,879
know about common mistakes that are made

1389
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,480
when growing in Rockwell and how they

1390
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:08,318
can be avoided break it down for us for

1391
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:11,960
one underwatering um again and

1392
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:15,000
overwatering people there's people that

1393
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:17,358
won't understand that Hydro does not

1394
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,559
retain not Hydro that rock wool does not

1395
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:23,039
retain water like that you know and

1396
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,400
they'll maybe go into it with an IDE

1397
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:26,199
maybe you're somebody like all right

1398
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,240
I'll paint two scenarios you're already

1399
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:29,558
a grower

1400
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:31,598
that you may want to switch to Hydra I

1401
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:34,200
specifically Rock wo if you come from

1402
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,838
soil or cocoa where water will retain

1403
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:38,399
for a little bit then naturally you're

1404
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:40,759
going to assume that water will retain

1405
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,680
in the hydro or specifically rock wall

1406
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,760
and it's not going to you will have to

1407
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:47,000
water every day so underwatering for

1408
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,240
sure is is a killer right away because

1409
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,400
there's no buffer if you if you forget

1410
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:53,879
or skip a pot good luck that next day

1411
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,720
that plant's dead like especially the

1412
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:58,039
later in life they are maybe if they're

1413
00:50:55,719 --> 00:51:00,118
clones possibly if they're blocks you

1414
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:01,599
can go back and try to save a plant but

1415
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:03,960
no once they're in pots if you miss a

1416
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,760
date they're dead so yeah underwatering

1417
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:08,599
is big and overwatering because most

1418
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,280
people that grow in Hydro traditionally

1419
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:12,280
speaking in my experience of what I've

1420
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,880
seen around Gardens nobody is handw

1421
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,160
watering Hydro they're all hooking up

1422
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:19,280
drift systems of some sort you know or

1423
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:21,679
drain to waste or or something you know

1424
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,480
so because of that overwatering too you

1425
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:25,199
know it's a super bad thing with hydro

1426
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,318
and people do it because the first thing

1427
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:27,838
people think to do when they set up a

1428
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:29,920
hydro system is how can I set up

1429
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:32,279
irrigation and if if you could rewire

1430
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,318
your mind and not think irrigation just

1431
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:36,519
because it's hydro and instead think

1432
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:39,079
well no let me still try to apply

1433
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:40,759
classic like growing principles I.E

1434
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:42,960
potting that's another thing that a lot

1435
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,160
of people don't do in Hydro I pot so

1436
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,358
that I can develop a root mass you know

1437
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:48,798
so it's like little things like that

1438
00:51:46,358 --> 00:51:50,920
where if you just kind of don't think

1439
00:51:48,798 --> 00:51:52,440
hydro and just think growing the same

1440
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,599
way that if you've grown before you will

1441
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:57,039
continue to grow don't change it you

1442
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:59,280
know and if you're new to it then also

1443
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:01,000
don't run to a drip system because you

1444
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,480
should learn your plants and the best

1445
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,199
way to learn your plants is to see them

1446
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,719
every day and the best way to see them

1447
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:08,358
every day is to have no choice but to

1448
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:10,039
walk up to that pot and water it so it's

1449
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:13,199
like you know there's just so many Pros

1450
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:15,519
to it and um you know other other cons

1451
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:18,598
would be understanding that you have no

1452
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:20,880
buffer with ph that's that's a big big

1453
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:24,480
thing you know in the beginning if you

1454
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:26,519
want to monitor your ppms and your EC do

1455
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,039
it I'm not somebody that says don't do

1456
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:29,519
do it shame on you there's a reason

1457
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:30,798
those numbers exist there's a reason

1458
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:32,798
that they're correlated to certain

1459
00:52:30,798 --> 00:52:35,119
things you know and if you want to take

1460
00:52:32,798 --> 00:52:37,759
a more scientific approach as you learn

1461
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,519
to grow that's okay because growing in

1462
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,680
Hydro generally speaking is a much more

1463
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:43,920
scientific methodology of growing than

1464
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:45,039
soil so you're already doing that if

1465
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,680
you're choosing to take the steps to

1466
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:50,079
grow in Hydro specifically rock wall so

1467
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:52,000
understanding that pH is is not your

1468
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,519
friend if you mess it up it's there is

1469
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,199
no buffer same with your your your

1470
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:59,838
overall EC um yeah basically anything

1471
00:52:58,199 --> 00:53:01,719
again if you're coming from a world

1472
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:03,440
where you are an experienced grower

1473
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:04,719
going trying to transition into

1474
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,798
something that maybe is a little easier

1475
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:09,598
on your back or something like that yeah

1476
00:53:06,798 --> 00:53:11,280
just just all the buffers that you have

1477
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,200
in what you do currently they're not

1478
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,440
going to apply in Hydro specifically in

1479
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:17,879
Rockwell at all get rid of them realize

1480
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,079
that you got to be on your um and then

1481
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:23,039
outside of that if you're new to it alog

1482
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:25,400
together I honestly tell people to stray

1483
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:28,279
away from it I don't necessarily think

1484
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:30,358
beginner Growers should do maybe they

1485
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:33,160
can do Hydro but they shouldn't

1486
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:36,798
necessarily grow how I grow because it

1487
00:53:33,159 --> 00:53:38,598
is very very dependent on you

1488
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:40,440
understanding how to read your plants

1489
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:42,318
and knowing when you're messing

1490
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,920
something up or just more importantly

1491
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:45,920
even down to the fundamentals of

1492
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,000
understanding what you're doing to the

1493
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,880
plant what what what does the pH mean

1494
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,559
what is too acidic or too alkaline even

1495
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:55,119
mean in in relation to the plant you

1496
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,680
know and so yeah there's a lot more

1497
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,838
in-depth understanding that you you have

1498
00:53:56,679 --> 00:54:00,719
to have to successfully do this unless

1499
00:53:58,838 --> 00:54:01,920
you were to like follow my recipe it's

1500
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:03,598
like yeah cool if I just handed you my

1501
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,519
recipe told you to buy my lights my

1502
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:06,960
medium my everything and just do this

1503
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:09,639
you're going to be fine but if you're

1504
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,358
just starting out and you hear this this

1505
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:12,920
this podcast and you're like oh I kind

1506
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:14,838
of want to try that then yeah just

1507
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,838
respect the fact that there is no buffer

1508
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:19,119
you will have to have a natural better

1509
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:21,759
understanding and a much sharper eye and

1510
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:24,240
a much much greater attention to detail

1511
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,359
of the plant so that you can see those

1512
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:28,719
little things that are onsets to you

1513
00:54:26,358 --> 00:54:31,039
Ming something up lots of tips there man

1514
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:33,000
this has been very insightful for me I

1515
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:35,759
mean I am a soil grower as much as you

1516
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,480
hate soil I got to admit I'm a SL grower

1517
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,160
but hearing about the differences it's

1518
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,159
very interesting to me I have used

1519
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:44,759
Rockwall cubes just to start seeds

1520
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:47,759
clones and so on and so forth but I've

1521
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,960
never done a whole grow with Rockwall

1522
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,599
I've seen your grows and they're

1523
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,280
beautiful but I've never done it myself

1524
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:54,599
so it's really cool to sit down with you

1525
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,839
today and hear about how you do it let's

1526
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:57,440
wrap things up here can you tell the

1527
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:59,199
listeners how they can find you and what

1528
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,760
you have upcoming in the future well

1529
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:03,279

man I I as somebody that's respected by

1531
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,119
a lot of people in the community the

1532
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,880
fact that you appreciate what I'm doing

1533
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:10,119
and that that you look at my Gardens and

1534
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,720
you you don't have knocks on them I

1535
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:13,798
appreciate it bro so thank you for

1536
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:15,358
having me on here and just thank you for

1537
00:55:13,798 --> 00:55:17,599
for just considering me an equal bro I

1538
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:19,519
respect what you do for real and as far

1539
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,359
as getting in touch with me and whatnot

1540
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:22,880
we don't have I'm saying I'm now

1541
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:24,639
starting to say this on every podcast

1542
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,519
because I've been finding out that

1543
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:28,558
people are like creating telegrams and

1544
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:30,519
saying they're me and doing a bunch of

1545
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:33,400
really [ __ ] up and taking money from

1546
00:55:30,519 --> 00:55:35,519
people and and whatnot and it's just we

1547
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:37,880
have no telegrams and and I'm not just

1548
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:40,318
saying this is not a ploy I'm serious we

1549
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:42,318
have no telegrams we have no Snapchats

1550
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:45,558
we have no nothing there is no way you

1551
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:48,318
can contact me unless you go to my Swank

1552
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:50,160
genetics Instagram or Swank tools

1553
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:53,159
Instagram or the Swank collection

1554
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:56,558
Instagram and if you even try to ask me

1555
00:55:53,159 --> 00:55:58,038
for product I'm just going to block you

1556
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,640
and there's so many people that can

1557
00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:00,680
attest to that for the last six years

1558
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:02,759
that have been trying to get in touch

1559
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:05,239
with me that I don't respond so yeah if

1560
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,799
you want Garden talk if you want to just

1561
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:08,919
you know chop it up about plants if I

1562
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:10,880
can help you in any way like that's what

1563
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,760
I want to do there's not enough of that

1564
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,838
and there's way too much gatekeeping in

1565
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,240
this community and way too much people

1566
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:19,440
that I have a problem with because all

1567
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:21,399
they want to do is act like their Tech

1568
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,679
is something special and it's not this

1569
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:25,480
is a plant let's all grow it so hit me

1570
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:26,759
up for reasons like that don't hit me up

1571
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,679
because you think I'm going try

1572
