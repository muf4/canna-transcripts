1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,990
what's up everybody feel that don't know

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:05,818
me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,929
you watch a mattress channel got a topic

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,120
video for you today

5
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:10,859
this one was requested by a viewer he

6
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,599
wants me to talk about par so in this

7
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:14,428
video I'm gonna talk about par I'll talk

8
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,559
about what the optimal power levels are

9
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,829
for growing plants and also talk about

10
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:22,500
PPF and ppfd which are measurements of

11
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:23,729
par so first off what is par par stands

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,698
for a photosynthetically active

13
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,710
radiation it's the energy that your

14
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,960
plants use in order to grow the light

15
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,789
emitted from the grill light are photons

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,739
think of them as little balls of energy

17
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:36,238
falling down onto your plant then of

18
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:38,159
course your plant takes those photons

19
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,078
and uses them for the photosynthesis

20
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,639
process so how much power does your

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,689
plants need there's a couple of

22
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,640
different measurements that you can look

23
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:46,829
at PPF is the first thing that you can

24
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,230
look at PP f stands for photosynthetic

25
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,840
photon flux basically what that is is

26
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:53,339
the total light output that it fix your

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,170
emits when growers are shopping for

28
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,760
grill lights and I have to get people

29
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,559
hit me up asking me which grow lights to

30
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:01,589
buy one of the things I recommend them

31
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,089
to look at is the PPF now there is such

32
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,948
thing as giving your plants too much

33
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,210
light and of course you don't want to be

34
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:08,250
in a situation when you're not giving

35
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:09,719
your plants enough light so making sure

36
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,810
the grill lights you're looking to buy

37
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,640
has enough PPF for that grow space is

38
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,978
important in my opinion so what are the

39
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,868
optimal PPF levels for growing plants

40
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:21,000
well it really varies depending on what

41
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:22,709
plant you're looking to grow the chart

42
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,228
I'm about to show you right now are the

43
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:26,579
optimal levels of for growing m.j plants

44
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:28,798
now if you're growing some other type of

45
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,950
plants such as like leafy greens lettuce

46
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,618
bok choy spinach things like that

47
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,180
you won't need as intense PPF levels

48
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,819
that I'm about to show so on the screen

49
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,670
right now I'm showing the PPF levels

50
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:44,429
which are optimal for MJ plants now I

51
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,990
got this list from Eric from LED grow

52
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,479
light depot this is actually part of

53
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:49,890
their LED buyers checklist and it's one

54
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:51,840
of the top things that are mentioned on

55
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,840
the checklist so as you can see here if

56
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,899
you're in a 5 foot by 5 foot area around

57
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,450
1,500 micro moles per second PPF is

58
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,659
sufficient for that grow space around

59
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:07,228
1100 to 1500 micro moles per second PPF

60
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,780
for a full 45 4-foot area around 600 to

61
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:11,310
800 50 micro moles per second PPF

62
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,860
is going to be sufficient for a 3 foot

63
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,680
by 3 foot area and around 275

64
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,260
- 375 micro moles per second PPF is

65
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,540
going to be good for a 2 foot by 2 foot

66
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:24,299
area these PPF numbers are just a

67
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:26,310
general guideline somebody may reply in

68
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,890
the comment section and say that they go

69
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,390
after different PPF numbers so just keep

70
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:31,889
that in mind so that's one of the things

71
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:34,379
you can look at when you're shopping for

72
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:35,969
an LED grow light now unfortunately not

73
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:38,519
all grow light listings are going to

74
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:41,430
have a PPS number some manufacturers

75
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:44,430
just don't post a PPF number if they do

76
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,290
bonus you have something to go by if not

77
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,750
then you're kind of out a lot there I

78
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:51,060
noticed that on LED grow light Depot

79
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,879
website most of the listings seem to

80
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,140
have a PPF number which is great LED

81
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,389
grow light Depot is one of the companies

82
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:59,339
that I recommend I actually have a link

83
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:00,479
down in the description section below

84
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,459
and they have some of the top lights

85
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,929
some of the best lights for growing MJ

86
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,209
plants now if you're trying to buy a

87
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,730
light off of Amazon most of those lights

88
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,739
unfortunately aren't gonna list PPF data

89
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:12,810
so for those listings that don't show

90
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,159
PPF data something else you can look at

91
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,920
is ppfd

92
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,560
instead a ppfd stands for photosynthetic

93
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,750
photon flux density and basically what

94
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,269
that is is a spot check it's gonna tell

95
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,860
you in a particular spot what is the

96
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:27,659
power output on the screen right now

97
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,940
show you what the optimal ppfd

98
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:31,620
measurements are for m.j plants and this

99
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:33,900
is going by the light that is actually

100
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,150
hitting your plants so the optimal

101
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,120
levels for seedlings clones and other

102
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,489
plants are between 200 and 400 ppfd and

103
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,219
the vegetation stage it's often one to

104
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:47,939
hit your plants with 400 to 600 ppfd and

105
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:50,129
the flowering stage 600 to 900 ppfd is

106
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:52,109
optimal now these numbers are without

107
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,509
supplementing co2 if you're

108
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,400
supplementing co2 in your grow room you

109
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:58,709
can increase these numbers you can go

110
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,260
for higher part numbers just like the

111
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,819
PPF numbers that I showed you these ppfd

112
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:05,039
numbers are just general guidelines

113
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,900
somebody might comment on this video and

114
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,239
say that they go after different ppfd

115
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,739
numbers so just keep that in mind now

116
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,939
there are a ton of other things that we

117
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,650
can talk about when we're talking about

118
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:16,290
lighting I do just want to keep this

119
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,910
video to par PPF ppfd

120
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,799
if there any other topics that you want

121
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,910
me to cover that relate to lighting let

122
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,259
me know in the comment section below

123
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,479
just to give you a quick update on

124
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:25,589
what's upcoming on this channel the next

125
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,000
video I'm gonna actually hit you with a

126
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:29,159
part test Ida

127
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,170
were recommend a particular grow light

128
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,000
that he wanted to see a part test done

129
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,770
on so I reached out to that company and

130
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,269
actually got them to Sevilla light so

131
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:37,829
that'll be coming up next and in the

132
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:39,269
video after that will be another Q&amp;A

133
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:41,219
video so if you haven't already hit that
