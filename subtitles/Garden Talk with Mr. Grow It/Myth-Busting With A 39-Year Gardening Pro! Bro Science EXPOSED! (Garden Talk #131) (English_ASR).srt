Nevada you had a talk there and I was

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,039
blown away the amount of knowledge that

76
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:58,359

77
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:00,120
been gardening medicinal plants for 39

78
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,000
years now and the amount amount of

79
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,280
knowledge that you have I can only

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,519

00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:16,639
myth busting type thing and it just

86
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,039
brought out so many good points and I

87
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,919
thought doing something similar to that

88
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:21,878

89
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,359

I've learned a lot along the way um I've

113
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:27,599
been around plants my whole life my

114
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,439
mom's a botanist her little sister ran

um my my parents had a friend uh Stuart

119
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:44,360
who threw a night blooming series party

120
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,959
every year so I've always had cool Plant

121
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,400
people around me I grew up in the Smoky

122
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:52,319
Mountains uh just outside of Knoxville

123
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:54,079
Tennessee and so it's until I came to

124
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,599
Washington State I would have said it's

125
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,439
the most Lush place on the planet I

126
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,560
would say Washington is now that I'm

127
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:05,439
here but just growing up in a place that

128
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,839
had ferns as big as me you know stuff

129
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,680
that made you you you know you wouldn't

130
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,719
have been surprised if a dinosaur walked

131
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,400
out of those woods and just those plants

132
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,960
just I don't know there's something

133
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:21,839
about the uh plants that just captured

134
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:23,758
my imagination as a kid um there's

135
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,560
something really special about the

136
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:30,199
custodial responsibility of caretaking

137
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,478
for uh for life you know you've got this

138
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,000
this plant and uh regardless of its you

139
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:39,639
know you know I've got a Bonia addiction

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
you know um I I've got uh you know for

141
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:44,680
the people that can see I've got this my

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,680
my my little pet Monera elbow monstera

143
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:51,280
behind me I I uh I love to grow Cactus

144
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,280
and succulents um I'm not the biggest

145
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:56,519
flower guy I I like you know really

146
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:59,879
simple flowers like amb buonas and stuff

147
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:03,439
like that but um yeah I I just love

148
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:06,120
plants and growing satisfies I have a

149
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:10,478
very curious brain and I love math and I

150
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:13,240
love chemistry and um I'm fortunate to

151
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:17,079
have figured that out as a as a really

152
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,560
young person that that that was a a nice

153
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:21,159
there's something that it does really

154
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,199
nice for my brain uh to work on math

155
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,240
problems and um when I figured out that

156
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:28,759
chemistry grew plants that I I was on to

157
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,680
something and I really fell in love with

158
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,319
the whole process and so I'm kind of a

159
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:37,879
mathletic nerd that my mom calls me

160
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:39,759
mathletic but um I I I love the art side

161
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:40,918
of growing as well you know there's

162
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,439
definitely a science but there's

163
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:47,240
definitely an art when we talk about

164
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:50,319
watering and um just just observation of

165
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,160
plants um yeah it's very humbling to

166
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,000
grow plants it's it's um it's it's

167
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,479
exercise and patience it's one of my

168
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,399
favorite forced meditations and um yeah

169
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,639
I just I I feel very fortunate to have

170
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:06,000
plants in my life and uh just just the

171
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,840
active growing is really important just

172
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,439
for me mentally just just to be happy I

173
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:13,918
I love to grow plants oh we shared that

174
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:17,279
same passion so when did you get

175
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:22,000
involved with kiss Organics um so I had

176
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:23,359
a facility I had a a a hemp facility in

177
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,199
Charleston South

178
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,879
Carolina and founded that with a couple

179
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,720
of other guys I'd known for a really

180
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:34,400
long time one of them for almost 20

181
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,120
years and we founded this facility and

182
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,598
we found ourselves having to do some

183
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,879
pivots really fast because in South

184
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:43,959
Carolina we could produce flour but we

185
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,919
couldn't they changed the law after we

186
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:47,519
after we built the after we built the

187
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,918
baseball field you know build it and

188
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,519
they will come we build it and then they

189
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:55,959
changed the law to where we could not

190
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:59,478
sell finished flowers in the state and

191
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:01,198
So that obviously required a pivot you

192
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:03,758
you know as far as the business model

193
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,000
and so we moved to a nursery

194
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,439
space um and so we were working with a

195
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,519
lot of

196
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:15,158
HBCU it was a minority uh owned company

197
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:17,839
um you know I was I was the only white

198
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:21,240
person involved with with the founding

199
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:23,598
of the company and so we got uh involved

200
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,000
with a bunch of HBCU historically black

201
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:26,839
colleges and universities in the

202
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,959
Southeast and so we started doing the

203
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:32,079
propagation for them and so they doing

204
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:33,918
you know now that you know prohibition

205
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,440
is kind of slipping off there you know

206
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,399
universities wanted to get into the

207
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,080
research game and there was a lot of

208
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,879
federal money and uh especially like

209
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,320
during covid and um so we started

210
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:49,480
working with these folks

211
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:53,278
and when that was no longer sustainable

212
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,839
and that that farm shut down uh a really

213
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:58,200
good friend of mine and Tad's a mutual

214
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,279
friend of ours Justin McGill moo Farms

215
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,278

really amazing grower the you know I I

218
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,639
think he has his environmentals dialed

219
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:15,079
in better than anybody I know um just

220
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:19,360
just top shelf grower but we're all

221
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:22,639
buddies um I didn't know Tad I well I I

222
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,639
knew Tad um I guess professionally I'd

223
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,919
reached out to Tad a couple of times

224
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,519
just because of my farm and he was

225
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:31,719
always really great about picking up the

226
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:35,360
phone he always made himself accessible

227
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:39,440
and um Justin and I just became good

228
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:43,079
friends um through other channels and he

229
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,560
told Tad that I was looking for a job

230
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:48,159
and Tad said what's Brandon do and

231
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,239
Justin said he does soil reports and so

232
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,799
I did a little try out soil report for

233
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,399
Justin and Tad Tad liked the cut of my

234
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:58,719
jib and here we are a couple years later

235
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,958
and um you know I I I'm really proud to

236
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,600
be on the kid

237
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:08,039
team uh I I I found Tad uh through the

238
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,200
soil food web folks you know Elaine

239
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:14,639
Ingam and you know Leon hussy Tad's dad

240
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,240
he was one of elain's advisers on

241
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,879
compost in the you know beginning days

242
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,240
and so I've got you know I've got

243
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,240
manuscripts of Jeff lenell's here at the

244
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,278
house because Tad's parents used to live

245
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,839
in this house uh with Tad's dad's notes

246
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:30,879
in them and so there's just a lot of

247
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:35,079
history with kiss um with Organics and

248
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:37,679
and compost and compost teas but I heard

249
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:40,359
Tad do a a

250
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,479
webinar conversation W with a bunch of

251
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:46,120
folks or he gave a talk and he said

252
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,159
actionable data and I said I got to find

253
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,360
this guy you know he was he was the

254
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:53,559
first person that was talking about

255
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,278
metrics and targets and you know I've

256
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:58,799
I've really tried you know I've got 19

257
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:02,120
years of salt and 20 years of organic

258
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:05,838
and I spent at least 10 years just

259
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:08,078
throwing every every penny I had and

260
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,519
everything I you know every amendment I

261
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:13,519
could at the wall trying to see what

262
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:16,278
would stick and then really just kind of

263
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,440
circled back and started trying to apply

264
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:23,039
what I knew about chemical fertilizers

265
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,560
and driving growth with Organics through

266
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,799
a more targeted method and so when I

267
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,759
when I found Tad I was like this this

268
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:32,078
guy's speaking my language I've got to I

269
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,360
got to find this and so I I feel really

270
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:36,879
lucky to be there um I I feel like I'm

271
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,159
an integral part of the kiss team I do

272

302
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,599
and he's provided a lot of space for me

303
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,560
to be wrong and um you know this is the

304
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,639
first time you know I'm an older I'm an

305
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:59,439
older person I'll leave it at that but

306
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:03,039
uh I've I've been working since since I

307
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,199
was 15 I've had a lot of different jobs

308
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:09,599
this cultivation is the only thing I've

309
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:12,759
done the whole time um

310
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,759
but I it's this is the first time I've

311
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:18,159
ever had a job where it's okay for me to

312
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:20,439
mess up as long as I don't do it again

313
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,799
and I learn something from it and so if

314
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,959
I can mess up and learn something that

315
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,639
helps other

316
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:28,359
Growers I'm fully supported in that and

317
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:34,159
so that's a really that's a really

318
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:35,919
amazing space to work in um you know I

319
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,719
when we were doing some some of the work

320
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:41,319
at our hemp facility in South Carolina

321
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,079
we were working with some really huge

322
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,560
companies uh we were doing some some

323
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,958
really interesting

324
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:51,000
research you could only take it so far

325
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:52,919
though cuz you know there were some some

326
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,919
targets that people were hoping you

327
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,240
would hit you know and so it wasn't

328
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:58,799
driven

329
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,278
scientifically you know as much as you

330
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,159
know they were really hoping this was

331
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:04,799
going to pan out because there'd be a

332
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,799
financial reward and so I'm in a

333
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,559
situation where I don't have to provide

334
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:12,078
any kind of you know economic impetus to

335
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:14,838
do an experiment it just has to help

336
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:17,159
another grower down the road so really

337
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,680
lucky yeah I think that whole mindset

338
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:21,319
continuous Improvement and learning from

339
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,120
your mistakes I think that's a a

340
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,800
fantastic way to go about it and that's

341
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,039
the way I go about it as well okay let's

342
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:29,919
get into some of these questions that we

343
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,360
have here for you so some of these

344
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:35,679
questions that we have on the list here

345
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,639
are controversial they are uh things

346
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:42,159
that we used to kind of think we're

347
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,839
right but may or may not be right so

348
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:47,240
let's just go one by one here I want to

349
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,440
start with clones taking clones now I

350
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,120
remember back when I first started

351
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,680
growing back in 2010 I think 2011 is

352
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,879
when I actually started reading Jorge

353
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,078
cant book The Grower's Bible so big

354
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:00,039
shout out to Jorge and one of the things

355
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:01,439
in his book he mentioned when you take

356
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:03,439
clones you should to be taking them from

357
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,639
the bottom part of the plant because

358
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,680
it'll give you a higher chance of

359
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,159
rooting due to the hormones now is that

360
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,239
the case I I I know that we've learned

361
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:15,439
quite a bit since that book was released

362
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,799
in 2006 break it down for us does taking

363
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,240
clones from the bottom part of the plant

364
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,639
have a higher chance of rooting due to

365
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:25,799
the hormones so the the first thing I

366
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:28,639
want to say the disclaimer here is you

367
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,639
know even diffusion is a theory it's a

368
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,039
theory

369
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:34,959
we don't know that you know um there

370
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,679
there was a and I apologize this is a

371
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,318
real quick segue but there was a TED

372
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:40,879
Talk I saw where a guy got up and said

373
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:42,838
everybody raise your hand if you know

374
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,159
something and everybody in the room room

375
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,560
raised their hand and he picked on

376
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,838
somebody in the front room we'll just

377
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:49,239
call him Dave and he was like okay so

378
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,120
what do you know and he's like I know my

379
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,519
name's Dave and he was like okay how do

380
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,839
you know that and he's like well it's on

381
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,159
my driver's license my social security

382
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,040
card my birth certificate it's what my

383
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,639
parents call me it's what everybody my

384
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:06,958
wife calls me and he's like okay well

385
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:09,440
he's got reliable Witnesses he's got

386
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,799
documentation we can be pretty confident

387
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,279
that he's Dave and he's like what else

388
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,719
do you know and he's like well I know

389
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:16,600
the the Earth travels around the Sun and

390
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,040
he's like does everybody agree that the

391
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,120
Earth travels around the Sun and

392
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:22,159
everybody did and he said but how do you

393
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,278
know that have you ever done the

394
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:29,639
experiment yourself do you know it or

395
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:31,198
are you just confident and so

396
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,959
with all these myth things that we're

397
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:37,120
going to touch on today I I want people

398
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:40,518
the the take the big takeaway is use

399
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:44,360
critical thinking keep an open mind

400
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:46,600
covariance covariance and covariance you

401
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,519
know there's so many other these are

402
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,159
open systems so even when we're trying

403
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,759
to control for

404
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:56,519
one toggle switch to flip there's other

405
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:58,600
things that are getting flipped nothing

406
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,839
happens in a vacuum in those rooms and

407
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,120
so

408
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,160
um rather than people arguing let's move

409
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,038
the conversations forward let's be

410
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,519
productive Let's help each other as you

411
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:12,558
know I I've been growing this amazing

412
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:15,798
plant for 39 years and for 38 I haven't

413
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:18,199
been able to talk about it and so for me

414
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:20,359
the fact that we can share we should all

415
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,480
just be you know we we should be so

416
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:25,198
excited to help each other and share you

417
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,439
know um humans like to be on teams it's

418
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,360
just part of our DNA but but in this

419
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,440
this could be one big team and it would

420
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:35,159
be really awesome so to answer the

421
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,640
question about the the propagation and I

422
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:42,960
feel like you know I was doing 20 to

423
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:44,640
40,000 cuts at a time for those HBCU so

424
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,798
I've definitely had statistically

425
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,080
relevant sample size and I feel very um

426
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:53,440
you know it's something I know because

427
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:56,359
I've done it I've done the experiment

428
00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:00,159
I've done 880,000 Cuts in a year you

429
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:02,759
know and so

430
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:05,760
taking clones from the top and the

431
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:08,319
bottom of the plant does not matter the

432
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:10,640
the hormones don't load differently as

433
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:13,079
far as far as the rooting hormones in

434
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,000
the plant um you don't get better

435
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:17,319
success using the top or the bottom of

436
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,640
the plant so you can take clones from

437
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:23,639
and I have from every part of the plant

438
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,440
um this is a great example of people

439
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:30,840
having accurate data that's not good

440
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,558
data and what happens is this this what

441
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:35,240
the white paper that people site for

442
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:37,678
this that you want to take it from a

443
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,480
certain part of the plant is accurate

444
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,159
data but it's not for this plant it's

445
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,720
for a different plant and so with that

446
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:48,600
plant yes you do get better success you

447
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,159
know taking your clones from one area of

448
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:52,798
the plant versus another because you do

449
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:57,120
get uh a different hormone load this

450
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:59,599
plant it's not true and so um that's

451
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,279
that's one that people can you know

452
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:04,038
confidently you know do their

453
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,918
propagation from top bottom of the plant

454
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:08,359
I think it's more important to you know

455
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:11,360
the things that are important are

456
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:13,439
rotating those moms every 6 months

457
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:17,599
making sure those moms are are healthy

458
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,759
and I think that um you know uh IPM you

459
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,918
know getting getting something in there

460
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,720
so that you don't get a week eight

461
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,200
fusarium explosion making sure that

462
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,679
you're testing root stock for

463
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,200
hplvd with you know sufficiently old

464
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,640
enough you know root stock uh that

465
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,519
stuff's way more important um but as far

466
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,919
as propagation you can confidently take

467
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:41,279
clones from anywhere on the plant um the

468
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,640
the the big thing would just be to

469
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,279
manage the health of that canopy you

470
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,000
know you don't want to overt trim a

471
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,918
plant or you know cut someplace where

472
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,880
there's not a you know a node for growth

473
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,559
or something like that but okay so you

474
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,200
speak about roots and I want to actually

475
00:19:55,558 --> 00:20:00,200
dive into that next white fuzzy Roots

476
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,960
this is something that you had talked

477
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,360
about during your talk at the soil

478
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,159
Summit white fuzzy Roots we usually

479
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:09,158
determine that as being Health right

480
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,039
healthy Roots when they're white fuzzy

481
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:14,320
although that actually isn't the case or

482
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:16,400
may not be the case talk to us about

483
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,519
that yeah so this is just a kind of like

484
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,080
a fun little anecdotal one and it

485
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:24,558
doesn't there's not really anything to

486
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:26,798
be done about it but when you see you

487
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:29,200
know everybody everybody who takes

488
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:32,240
clones it's there's something magical

489
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,038
when you see those bright white Roots

490
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,960
finally break out of your substrate or

491
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:40,599
your cubes or whatever it is your you're

492
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:45,079
doing your propagation and sand whatever

493
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:49,000
um something that uh we know from Flor

494
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:51,879
culture world is that when you've got

495
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,640
you know a little white rootlet po

496
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,400
popping out of the um side of your pod

497
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,640
and then all of a sudden you get all

498
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,798
these like little furry

499
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,080
um they're just more root hairs coming

500
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:06,440
off of that same root that that's that's

501
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,359
a good healthy root and it doesn't mean

502
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,240
that it's not healthy I'm not saying

503
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:13,079
that that Root's not healthy but what

504
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,120
that root is doing is that root is

505
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:17,319
adding you know instead of having like

506
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:20,119
this root now it's got this root it's

507
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:22,639
added all this surface area and so what

508
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:25,278
that is is showing you that the not that

509
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,000
the Root's not healthy but the plant is

510
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:29,200
seeking specifically phosphorus and I

511
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,119
think I

512
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,519
but it is that plant is is that's a

513
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:37,759
morphological response to that plant

514
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:41,400
realizing it doesn't have enough of a

515
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,839
specific nutrient and so there's nothing

516
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,038
wrong with the root there's nothing to

517
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:47,959
be worried about there but it just means

518
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:50,480
it's time to get those pot potted up and

519
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,600
so that's just a an interesting one

520
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,798
where you know we just apply critical

521
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:58,079
thinking you know we love this plant so

522
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:00,319
much it's such a special plant and it's

523
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:02,759
incred special and important to me in so

524
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:06,038
many different ways but we have to

525
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:08,759
remember that the plant it's got its own

526
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:11,440
biological mission that has nothing to

527
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:13,679
do with Chris nothing to do with Brandon

528
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,480
it wants to reproduce and have a you

529
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,720
know another generation and so the plant

530
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,558
is going to do what the plant needs to

531
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,720
do to make that happen some of that ends

532
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,678
up being beneficial for us but that's

533
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:31,000
just secondary and so something like

534
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:34,519
that um the root putting on more surface

535
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,599
area is just a really nice place where

536
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,960
people can kind of think about the what

537
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:41,719
the plant needs and what the plant's

538
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,120
doing and so yeah there's nothing wrong

539
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,679
I'm not saying if you walked into

540
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,639
somebody's clone propagation room if

541
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,679
they've got fuzzy Roots I'm not I'm not

542
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,038
knocking that but it what it's telling

543
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,200
you is it's time to go ahead and

544
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:55,519
probably get those either get him some

545
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,880
nutrients or get him potted up and again

546
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:02,558
covariant you know it could be a

547
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:04,720
combination of nutrient and VPD but all

548
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,879
the all the white papers all the

549
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,159
research show that that is the plant

550
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,120
looking for looking to mine phosphorus

551
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,679
that's really interesting now another

552
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:17,839
thing that people deem as being a good

553
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,360
thing which may actually indicate the

554
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,959
plant needs something is leaves preying

555
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,839
to the light I know this is a Hot Topic

556
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:29,519
that uh Tad hussy had actually created a

557
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:31,759
Instagram video on it just blew up

558
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,720
I wanted to get your thoughts on it what

559
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:35,599
do you think about the leaves praying to

560
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,798
the light is that a good thing or could

561
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,278
there potentially be something wrong

562
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:41,720
with the plant so praying leaves is one

563
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:43,480
that will really people feel very very

564
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,159
strongly about this and I would

565
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,839
challenge people to challenge their

566
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,559
biases you know there's absolutely no

567
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,079
reason to run off into the sunset and

568
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:53,359
marry your bias it just it doesn't you

569
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:56,038
know there's a great interview with

570
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:58,519
Muhammad Ali where a guy is kind of

571
00:23:56,038 --> 00:24:01,440
challenging him on something he had said

572
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:03,759
as a young person 30 years before that

573
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,558
and rather than you know dignify the

574
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:09,440
question Al just responded by a you know

575
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:12,079
I I think a man that hasn't grown in 30

576
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,679
years that would be a that would be a

577
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,678
waste of a life wouldn't it something

578
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,480
like that but basically was saying allow

579
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:21,159
me to grow allow me to be a different

580
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:24,360
person than I was 30 years ago um and

581
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:26,320
so we should be able to evolve in our

582
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:28,959
our understanding of plants and this

583
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:32,038
goes again this is the most important

584
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,399
one for covariant there are so many

585
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:36,599
factors that that affect Leaf angle and

586
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:37,879
that's what we're talking about we're

587
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:41,558
talking about Leaf angle we're talking

588
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:44,799
about plants preying hard and so uh

589
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:48,158
water uh accumulation is one one reason

590
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:52,839
for leaf angle nutrient loads in the

591
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:54,960
plants CO2 levels uh light both the

592
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:57,359
amount of light and the

593
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,919
Spectrum um so right there you have

594
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:02,158
covariant just in the the same

595
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:05,600
measurement

596
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:08,799
um there there's so many different

597
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,000
things going on with Leaf angle and you

598
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,519
know and like and if you go through and

599
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,919
read all the white papers like it's

600
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:14,480
really funny because you'll have these

601
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:16,720
really intelligent scientists because

602
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,159
I'm an NPK guy you know I don't study

603
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,880
Leaf angle so I go find somebody that's

604
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,600
you know devoted their life to studying

605
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,840
Leaf angle and it's really funny because

606
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:27,759
those guys will go through all these

607
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:31,278
different co-variants and then they'll

608
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:33,480
say it's so complicated that it's not

609
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:34,679
really even worth studying you know so

610
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,038
this is something they spent their whole

611
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:40,880
life studying and um part of it is that

612
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:44,599
all these research that we're looking at

613
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:48,720
for leaf angle um and this being an

614
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:53,678
optimal Leaf angle is monocot that's

615
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:55,839
it's grasses and cereals um and so if

616
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,399
you and I are growing wheat man it would

617
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:01,240
be great to get plants with a you you

618
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:02,798
know a genetically predisposed Leaf

619
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,200
angle because that's part of it too is

620
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:09,558
genetics it's another covariant

621
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:12,000
um uh Leaf's ability to cap capture

622
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:14,558
light and so you know like if if you've

623
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,119
got too much light it would make sense

624
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:19,119
that your Leaf angle would turn up and

625
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:22,959
so it's going to catch less light but we

626
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:24,079
see praying hard and we see flat leaves

627
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,720
with the same

628
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:30,038
ppfd so is it just the light load

629
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:33,640
probably not not is it maybe the light

630
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:36,398
load and the fact that CO2 is low and so

631
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:39,759
you get this rigid turer to the leaf and

632
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:42,398
so that forces the stomata to be open we

633
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:44,759
don't know you know and so that's the

634
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:47,639
answer to this one is that we don't

635
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:51,278
definitively know nobody knows

636
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:53,679
definitively um the researchers are all

637
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:55,640
open to that and so if people who you

638
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,640
know who and I'm not saying that you

639
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,600
have to have a doctorate to speak on

640
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:03,000
something but if people have spent an

641
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:05,678
extra six years of school just to just

642
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,798
to go down that rabbit hole for you you

643
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,759
know it it's you know and that might be

644
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:12,480
a good segue to to talk about white ash

645
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:14,640
you know but there are there is somebody

646
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,038
out there who spent their life studying

647
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,440
that and so you know if I've got a

648
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:22,440
pathology issue I'm going to reach out

649
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,440
to uh Chris Hayes and Michael

650
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,038
brownbridge at bioworks it's Cornell a

651
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,880
department it's hard to beat you know if

652
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:30,960
I've got a pest problem reaching out to

653
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,559
Suzanne way W Evans she's the gold

654
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,278
standard she's she's had her own company

655
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,158
not just been an entomologist but she's

656
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:41,240
had her own company for 30 years she's

657
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,200
seen it all you know and so um I always

658
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,839
just try to reach out to the people who

659
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,159
are you know up the food chain for me in

660
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:51,278
whatever particular area and I don't go

661
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:54,039
to forums a lot I go to traditional a

662
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:57,240
you know uh it's not like soybean and

663
00:27:54,038 --> 00:28:00,240
corn and tobacco haven't you know

664
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:03,000
they've got hundreds years of research

665
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,000
so we don't have to reinvent the wheel

666
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,079
with this plant we have some peculiar

667
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,319
things that we have to do as far as you

668
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:11,398
know protecting those flowers from

669
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:14,960
moisture and that kind of thing but as

670
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:16,759
far as driving evapo transpiration

671
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,600
driving

672
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:21,839
morphology uh generative or or

673
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,278
vegetative steering we know how to do

674
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:26,599
that you

675
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:31,640
know so as far as the leaf angle thing

676
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:35,839
goes um in my opinion it doesn't really

677
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,640
matter in my opinion um it it's

678
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,038
something that we can't def nobody can

679
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,759
definitively say there's nobody that has

680
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:44,519
got the research to definitively say

681
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,558
this is replicable I can do this

682
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,240
parameter matched with this parameter

683
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:51,079
and every single time I get this praying

684
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,558
Le so until we have that nobody can say

685
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:58,359
definitively it does seem to be tied to

686
00:28:54,558 --> 00:29:02,278
co-variants um it seems to be difficult

687
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:06,158
to get to to happen moving one toggle

688
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:09,319
and then um it does seem to be a symptom

689
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:13,159
of some sort of stress because we don't

690
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:16,678
see these plants doing that in a in a

691
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:18,840
monocrop field in nature we don't see it

692
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:20,720
typically happening day in and day out

693
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:24,079
in a Big monocrop

694
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,200
Greenhouse um or in a grow room and so

695
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:28,158
we

696
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,240
see these you know we see these

697
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,320
different types of environments hitting

698
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,480
similar metrics it's just not replicable

699
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:40,079
and so um it does seem to be a

700
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:43,558
stress uh symptom but it doesn't seem to

701
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:46,398
be anything that you know I would be

702
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:48,440
particularly concerned about you know I

703
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:50,439
would be more concerned if my Harvest

704
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,240
metrics were off I'd be more concerned

705
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,720
if my tpping expression or my triome

706
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,880
development wasn't where it was I'd be

707
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,798
more concerned if you know saw some sort

708
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,600
of visual deficiency or morphology

709
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:06,720
change um you know and so it's cool to

710
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:11,000
go down these rabbit holes but at the

711
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,319
end of the day you know um I I don't I

712
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,960
definitely don't think it's this one's

713
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:17,798
worth fighting about like this white ash

714
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,480
I might I might meet you outside about

715
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:22,200
white ash but as far as this one I just

716
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,599
don't see why people would want to fight

717
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,480
about it you know um white ash makes

718
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:29,959
sense to me why people would fight about

719
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,960
it because there's a there's a

720
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:36,079
unfortunately in the enduser market

721
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:37,759
there is an economic advantage to having

722
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:39,639
White Ash in the same way there's

723
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:42,720
economic advantage to having like a

724
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,559
single note really high THC which you

725
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,759
know as adults we all know that that

726
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:52,678
that there's a lot more

727
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:55,798
complex um experiences to be had as

728
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:59,159
opposed to just a single note THC

729
00:30:55,798 --> 00:31:00,679
experience and so um I understand why

730
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:03,840
people double down anytime there's a

731
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:05,639
monetized message you know it's it's

732
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:07,839
easy to double down because if you don't

733
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:10,359
it affects your pocket and so I I

734
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:12,199
appreciate that and so you know in that

735
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:13,439
same vein I like to tread lightly in

736
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,319
those areas I don't want to hurt

737
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,200
people's feelings or get people mad but

738
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,798
White

739
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,759
Ash has been studied for hundreds of

740
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:26,558
years you know by the tobacco industry

741
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:29,119
by by by Wildlife Management by your

742
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:31,038
local fire department um I reached out

743
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,119
to a pyrology because this is a question

744
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:36,319
I get all the time and I had a I had an

745
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:37,879
opinion about it but I'm I'm not a pyes

746
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:41,439
and you know and so I reached out to

747
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,960
somebody who is and he explained that

748
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,960
yeah the only reason you're getting

749
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:51,000
black ash is because carbon and it's not

750
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:53,759
fully combusting and that can there's

751
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,038
different things whether it's resin uh

752
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:58,359
primarily the moisture content of the

753
00:31:56,038 --> 00:32:01,798
flour those things are you know

754
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:07,000
the puff volume like so you know tobacco

755
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:09,000
knows that a the burn rate and the burn

756
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,960
temperature of a cigarette's very

757
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,720
complex just like growing a plant it's

758
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,480
an open system there's a lot of

759
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:19,038
different things that affect that and so

760
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,319
again is it

761
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:25,440
covariant uh not necessarily cuz I can

762
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:28,398
take the worst product you've ever seen

763
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:32,200
in your life and get it bone dry

764
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:34,359
and it'll burn white I can also give you

765
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,000
the best product you've ever seen in

766
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:37,918
your life that's got a little bit of

767
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,519
moisture left into it which is honestly

768
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,399
my preference CU I feel like it's a

769
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:46,798
little smoother just preference um and

770
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:47,959
you'll get salt and pepper and so should

771
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:51,638
we be

772
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:54,720
evaluating the quality or the value of

773
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:56,759
the of that flower based on White Ash to

774
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,519
me is kind of like determining the

775
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:02,638
qualitative you know know uh uh measure

776
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:06,519
of your dinner by looking in the toilet

777
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:09,798
it it it's kind of irrelevant to me and

778
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:14,240
and we know that you know from tobacco

779
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:17,798
yeah you can spray uh a cigarette with

780
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:21,599
pottassium acetate or uh magnesium

781
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:24,359
acetate and it will burn white it's not

782
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:26,918
because there's more potassium in that

783
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:30,398
tobacco plant it's because you've

784
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:33,120
sprayed a chem accelerant onto the

785
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:35,678
cigarette I don't want chemical

786
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:38,719
accelerants sprayed onto anything that

787
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:42,480
I'm using you know I don't want it on my

788
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:45,720
clothes I don't want it in my food um

789
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:49,440
and so you also you know uh when folks

790
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,960
say that it's too much or too little of

791
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,320
something um you know plants that aren't

792
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,759
flushed enough like that's not that's

793
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:58,240
not the answer for sure because all

794
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:00,720
those other minerals

795
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,679
they burn white when they burn fully

796
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,319
they burn white and so it's not too much

797
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:10,240
of something uh we know that

798
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:12,039
um and then you know as far as it not

799
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,959
being enough of

800
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:17,878
something

801
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,440
um you're not going to force a plant to

802
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:22,118
take up luxury amounts of let's say

803
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,559
magnesium or

804
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:27,358
manganes so that it gets white ash it

805
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:29,078
goes back to that biological U objective

806
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:31,598
of the plant conversation like the

807
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:33,639
plant's not trying to get white ash you

808
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,679
know so it's not going to take up extra

809
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:40,000
an extra amount of some element that you

810
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:41,720
could spray on to the to the plant and

811
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,599
then I will say and here's where it gets

812
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:47,918
a little interesting you know those a

813
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:50,639
little curveball because um I have

814
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:53,838
noticed and I've worked with a a grower

815
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,878
in Los Angeles for about a year and a

816
00:34:53,838 --> 00:35:00,358
half on this he he he wants white ash

817
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:03,159
because he can drop a better dollar for

818
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:06,119
for his his work and I appreciate that

819
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:10,519
and so one of the things that he was

820
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:12,519
having issues with aside from that was

821
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:15,320
high chlorides and so he was getting

822
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:17,239
lockouts and of Trace elements at the

823
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,599
top of his plants and I immediately was

824
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:21,959
like let's look at your

825
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:25,160
chlorides um sure enough they were high

826
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,079
we got his chlorides down and all of a

827
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:29,000
sudden he started getting white ash

828
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:33,560
consistent

829
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:36,920
chlorides do not fully combust at any

830
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:41,078
temperature and so the theory that I'm

831
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:44,039
working on here is that perhaps High

832
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:46,880
chlorides could could

833
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:48,639
be an elemental where you know where it

834
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,880
doesn't make sense for a lot of the

835
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:53,920
other elements as to why that would have

836
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,640
any impact chlorides actually does make

837
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,400
make sense that if you up taking a lot

838
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:01,879
of chloride into your plant you could

839
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,599
potentially end up with with a uh you

840
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,240
know a factor that would make it

841
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:09,599
impossible for you to have white ash and

842
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:10,799
so here it is something I thought I

843
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,039
understood

844
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,079
fully I understood it a little bit

845
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:17,279
differently you know I got past the

846
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:19,599
whole you know that first step and was

847
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,200
like okay we understand that now but

848
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:25,240
here's another curveball and so you know

849
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:27,759
it's so it's it's I can't help a grower

850
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:29,759
if I don't keep an open mind and so and

851
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,440
I saw that relationship and that was a

852
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,200
thing that he was

853
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:37,039
chasing and now we're able to repeat

854
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:41,000
this over and over again maybe we are on

855
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:42,838
to something here you know so one I I

856
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,119
don't want you know at the end of the

857
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:48,000
day I don't think again this is not

858
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:52,440
worth fighting about um if you're making

859
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:56,639
more money that way yes it is but um I I

860
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:59,119
I it's for me it's not how I would judge

861
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:02,400
somebody's I wouldn't judge a grower by

862
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:04,640
White Ash and I wouldn't judge a flower

863
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,519
by white ash ever but I do think the

864
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,519
chloride thing is interesting it's worth

865
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:10,280
investigating it is really interesting

866
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:12,480
I'm glad you got into the White Ash

867
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,920
thing CU that is a Hot Topic and the

868
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,159
leaves praying to the light you know the

869
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:19,079
leaf positioning is another interesting

870
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,239
thing which really makes me open up my

871
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:22,880
mind because I've always been told hey

872
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,118
if the leaves are praying to the light

873
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,920
that means you're doing things right

874
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,920
that means the plants are happy they

875
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,318
have everything they need in order to

876
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,920
grow well and uh hearing that hey that

877
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:34,800
actually might be a problem it's you got

878
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,318
to take a step back and say okay that's

879
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,400
it could actually be something a problem

880
00:37:37,318 --> 00:37:41,039
but like you mentioned it's probably

881
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,920
just not worth the energy to try to

882
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,838
really figure it out because there's

883
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:48,318
there's so many variables right so like

884
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:50,679
trying to adjust the leaves so they are

885
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:52,838
praying or not praying it's just you got

886
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:55,279
bigger things to worry about in The Grow

887
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:58,480
yeah I if I walk in my room and my

888
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:02,119
leaves aren't praying I no alarm Bells

889
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,559
go off at all you know um you know it

890
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:08,000
could be VPD it could be you know it

891
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:10,159
could be so many things and it could be

892
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,880
the inner relationships of all those

893
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:17,078
things and um you know it's it's it's

894
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,599
infinitely interesting that's one of the

895
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:22,440
reasons I love to grow plants is you'll

896
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,720
never Master it uh I'm never going to

897
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,000
understand this stuff if somehow I could

898
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:29,838
magically understand everything I needed

899
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,639
to know about NPK I'd still have to know

900
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:33,318
lights I'd still have to know water I'd

901
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:35,679
still have to know environmentals I'd

902
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:39,318
still have to know it's just never stops

903
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:42,159
you know um so it's great you know it's

904
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:43,759
it's infinite room to to learn and we

905
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:45,239
all learn better when we're not when

906
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,319
we're doing this when we're sharing

907
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:50,559
instead of you know if you plant a flag

908
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:52,639
then you got to be right you know I'm

909
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:55,318
not interested in being right I just am

910
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:57,000
interested in that Kaizen of gradual

911
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:58,719
Improvement you know but consistent

912
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,559
Improvement gradual but consistent

913
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:03,399
Improvement The Continuous learning is

914
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:04,920
is what makes it fun in my opinion

915
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,079
that's one reason that that really makes

916
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,880
it fun is being able to learn new things

917
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:11,920
and try new methods and stuff like that

918
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,358
so I want to move on from this and get

919
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,800
into Hollow stems next now this is

920
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:18,519
another thing that you had talked about

921
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:21,480
in your talk at the soil Summit Holo

922
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:23,639
stems some stems are Hollow some aren't

923
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,119
talk to us about Hollow stems yeah so

924
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:27,960
this is another one kind of like the

925
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,358
cloning one where

926
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,079
there's a white paper that I you know

927
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:35,159
people it it's funny I I answer the

928
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:37,200
phones that kiss I answer a lot of the

929
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:39,719
grower questions at kiss and so I'll get

930
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:43,399
an email on Monday morning that's

931
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:45,399
essentially um hey Hollow stems are this

932
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,000
want to fight about it kind of thing and

933
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,440
I'm like no I don't want to fight about

934
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,880
it but here's what I understand about it

935
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:57,000
and so what I asked for anytime you know

936
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:59,519
um I'm I'm on one side or the other of a

937
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,318
coners ation with somebody is I ask them

938
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:03,318
for the you know where' they get their

939
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:04,880
data where where did they you know what

940
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:07,000
are they basing this on is it

941
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,880
experiential and I'm not knocking

942
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,559
experiential you know a hundred years

943
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,280
ago we didn't have

944
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:17,880
necessarily um you

945
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,560
know a lot of scientists were hob that

946
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,599
was a hobby for them they might be a

947
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:23,639
mailman and they come home and look at

948
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,559
the stars at night and they figured

949
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:27,480
something out or they're uh you know

950
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:30,400
they have a a greenhouse that they you

951
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,519
know work on Orchids on the weekend and

952
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,720
you know and

953
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:36,119
so experience is how you get to the math

954
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:38,598
side where you can start to prove

955
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:41,160
something you know to yourself you know

956
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:46,079
how do I know this and you know and you

957
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:50,039
can replicate it um Hollow

958
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,560
stems in plants that

959
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:55,480
don't

960
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:59,559
normally uh exhibit a hollow stem uh it

961
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:04,079
can be a a deficiency or disease and um

962
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:08,400
it happens uh in brassas so uh broccoli

963
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:11,839
it's very common um and it's uh I think

964
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,639
it's calcium and Boron um I'm I'm kind

965
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:15,119
of blanking right now so don't quote me

966
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:18,639
on that but I think it's calcium and

967
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,200
boron in brasas that creates that but

968
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:26,318
the paper that people site

969
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:29,279
for this plant is based off of brassas

970
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:32,800
and so again it's accurate for that

971
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:37,880
plant but not for this plant and so um

972
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:42,240
this plant can exhibit either a piy

973
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:45,240
solid uh stem or a hollow stem most of

974
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:47,479
the time it's piy and so people get

975
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:48,799
really worried about Hollow stems they

976
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,240
also get really worried about Hollow

977
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,400
stems when they're doing

978
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:57,598
propagation um one clue when I was

979
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,559
younger uh about Hollow stems is you

980
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,039
know one I always had really good

981
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:04,920
propagation rates no matter what so that

982
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:06,719
was interesting to me I thought you know

983
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,400
um you know I knew a plant wasn't a

984
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,358
straw but it was still you know kind of

985
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,639
interesting that I was still getting

986
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:19,039
this good germ rates but um I was only

987
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:21,279
seeing it outside I rarely saw it indoor

988
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:23,480
you know I've had some people you know

989
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,280
really want to get to the bottom of it

990
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,599
and so with this plant it's temperature

991
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:31,319
regulation and so have having that

992
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:34,559
Hollow stem enables the plant to more

993
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:37,440
efficiently um you know so air changes

994
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:39,920
temperature much faster than water right

995
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,559
and so that's why I get these

996
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,480
incredible uh nice cool days out here in

997
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,359
the Puget Sound because I'm surrounded

998
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:51,240
by cool water and so when it's 100 in

999
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:54,960
Seattle it's maybe 78 80 degrees out

1000
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:57,838
here and um so if there's air in that

1001
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,280
stem that plant can very rap rid L

1002
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:02,480
change temperature compared to if there

1003
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:06,640
was holding a bunch of water in there

1004
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:09,960
with all this um pith and organic matter

1005
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:11,679
and so when I read that explanation that

1006
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,639
that seemed to make sense to me that's

1007
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:17,279
something that you know checked all the

1008
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:19,960
boxes um so that's my understanding of

1009
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,440
it and that's you know based off again

1010
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,720
I'm an mpk guy but that's based off of

1011
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:27,559
you know research done by some really

1012
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:30,679
smart people who are very qualified next

1013
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:34,519
up I would like to talk about hugle

1014
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:36,318
culture now this is something that I am

1015
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:38,639
going to actually utilize myself I

1016
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:41,960
haven't yet but basically what this is

1017
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:45,000
in layman terms is digging a hole or

1018
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,519
filling your raised beds with wood first

1019
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,119
then putting your soil over it and then

1020
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:49,838
of course planting your plants in that

1021
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:51,400
so I'm about to actually assemble

1022
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:53,239
several raised beds in my backyard they

1023
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,599
just moved into a new house nice and so

1024
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:58,959
I'm going to do raise beds and then also

1025
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:00,880
uh instead of just having it 100% soil

1026
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,760
in order to save some money especially

1027
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,838
not the taller raised beds right vill

1028
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,680
would wood first then put your soil over

1029
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:10,719
it common method there's pros but

1030
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:12,679
there's also cons to this method can you

1031
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:16,318
break down the pros and cons to this for

1032
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:18,558
us yeah I I'm a big fan of Hugo culture

1033
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,519
um I grew up in East Tennessee and you

1034
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,720
know every house is on an angle like

1035
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:24,679
this you know if you if you miss a

1036
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:27,239
basketball shot in East Tennessee it's

1037
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:30,199
going to be 45 minutes to get the ball

1038
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:32,318
back you know and so it's so like you

1039
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:34,598
should have swes that's like really

1040
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:37,719
important ter you know teres or

1041
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:41,039
something is a really important um

1042
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:42,480
physical aspect of growing with a you

1043
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:46,279
know a challenge like that when you've

1044
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,800
got an incline like that and so um hugle

1045
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,720
culture is great for that because it's

1046
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,160
the natural Swale hugle culture is great

1047
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:55,318
because all that wood provides as it

1048
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:58,639
breaks down will provide a nice solid

1049
00:44:55,318 --> 00:45:01,800
structure and so uh um you can basically

1050
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:04,639
just use open the top of that up and use

1051
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:07,640
it like a raised bed for you know

1052
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:09,558
forever um without having to build a bed

1053
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:13,679
you know and we worry a lot especially

1054
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:16,319
with this plant with the um laws around

1055
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:18,159
it as far as the testing is concerned

1056
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:20,519
for heavy metals and that kind of stuff

1057
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:22,480
like that that eliminates all those

1058
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:24,800
questions about can I use this cinder

1059
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,559
block can I use this wood that may or

1060
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,839
may not have been treated with you know

1061
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:33,359
uh lead arsonate or you know whatever I

1062
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:35,318
don't know so um Mercury or arsenic to

1063
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:38,838
preserve wood and things like that and

1064
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:41,719
so there's a bunch of advantages to it

1065
00:45:38,838 --> 00:45:44,199
um it's it's really great in that you're

1066
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:47,719
usually you know at least you're being

1067
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:50,480
encouraged to use uh materials gathered

1068
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:53,639
locally um keeping that carbon footprint

1069
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,838
down um preferably you know off of your

1070
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:59,480
property but you know we we do what we

1071
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:02,679
can uh downside of hugle

1072
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:05,079
culture is and really the only downside

1073
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:08,879
to it to me

1074
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:12,280
um is that a lot of Growers don't

1075
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:15,119
realize that the bacteria in the soil

1076
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:17,200
it's got its own biological Mission and

1077
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,800
one of the things it likes in order to

1078
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:22,679
complete that mission is a certain

1079
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:25,920
carbon to nitrogen ratio in the soil and

1080
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:30,078
so when you think carbon you think wood

1081
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:33,639
um as a source and so if youve got this

1082
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:35,920
big bag and you fill it up this pie with

1083
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:39,960
you know this full with wood and then

1084
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:44,519
you put your your nitrates Your Greens

1085
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:47,039
your compost whatever on top um soil

1086
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:49,239
even what you've done is you've you've

1087
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,558
messed up the carbon to nitrogen ratio

1088
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:55,039
and so instead of that preferred 18 to1

1089
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:57,440
or lower you've got this crazy high

1090
00:46:55,039 --> 00:47:00,759
carbon to nitrogen ratio and the

1091
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,679
bacteria in the soil insists on being 18

1092
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,880
to1 or lower it's not it's not a debate

1093
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,838
they're not going to talk to you about

1094
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,440
it you can't change their mind you know

1095
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:11,039
in the same way that like people worry

1096
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:14,000
about fungal or bacterially dominated

1097
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:16,039
tees um when I first got into the soil

1098
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,358
food web stuff I was really you know

1099
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:20,960
focused on that and then when I've

1100
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:25,598
realized oh you know again evolving

1101
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:27,720
learning more is no matter what I do to

1102
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,039
that tea

1103
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:32,480
I I could hit whatever ratio you know

1104
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:35,400
magically somebody wants let's say once

1105
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,480
it hits that soil there's certain

1106
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:41,559
equilibriums that the soil you know

1107
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:44,440
biology is going to create and so

1108
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:46,640
um if you if you load up a bunch of wood

1109
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:51,400
I just did it to myself this past year I

1110
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:55,239
put in a a 5 foot X 52t bed and one end

1111
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:57,318
of it uh Tad's dad came out here and and

1112
00:47:55,239 --> 00:48:01,838
did it uh did some digging with the

1113
00:47:57,318 --> 00:48:05,199
tractor for me and it was my mess up I

1114
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:08,358
put a bunch of wood chips in in front of

1115
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:11,399
the pile and so one end just it's like a

1116
00:48:08,358 --> 00:48:13,719
little 3ot section nothing grew in it

1117
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,880
last year because the the bio the

1118
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:18,480
bacteria is going to use your nitrates

1119
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:21,880
as an energy source this is the big

1120
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:24,119
takeaway is going to use the U the

1121
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,318
nitrates as an energy source to break

1122
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:28,800
down that carbon and so it will not

1123
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:30,599
release to your plants and so by me

1124
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:34,440
getting all those wood chips into that

1125
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:36,039
end of the pile I or the end of my bed

1126
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:40,119
nothing grew in that little 3-foot

1127
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:42,480
section you know so it's it's super easy

1128
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:45,640
to fix you you know you have to add

1129
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:48,719
nitrates throughout the the season just

1130
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:50,798
con consistently and constantly um or

1131
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:53,519
you can wait you can just you know you

1132
00:48:50,798 --> 00:48:55,599
can build your hugle culture mounds and

1133
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:58,039
you can give them a year and you can let

1134
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:01,400
the bacteria do what it needs to do and

1135
00:48:58,039 --> 00:49:03,480
then you can grow you know after that um

1136
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,838
and it's not homogeneous you know it's

1137
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:09,280
not like you've

1138
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:11,400
got wood soil wood soil wood soil

1139
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,000
throughout the whole thing it's not as

1140
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:20,280
it's not super homogenous and so this

1141
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:23,079
top layer will act as a u kind of a a

1142
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,680
separate bed to a certain extent but

1143
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:27,720
where it meets that wood layer there is

1144
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,199
going to be a lot of biology going on

1145
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:32,118
and it is going to mine bird nitrates in

1146
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:34,039
your soil to do that so I just hate to

1147
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:36,400
see people give up on Hugo culture cuz

1148
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:38,679
it is such a cool thing and they they'll

1149
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,960
call me and say hey I did this and it's

1150
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:44,039
not working my plants are all yellow and

1151
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,838
they're dying and and I and and just you

1152
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:48,199
know tell them to add nitrogen or wait

1153
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:50,719
till next year I'm really glad I learned

1154
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:53,358
that because if I didn't know that and I

1155
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:55,598
did Yugo culture and then saw a poor

1156
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:57,719
result then I would probably get pretty

1157
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:00,119
upset but knowing this information gives

1158
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:01,639
me a little bit more confidence in doing

1159
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:04,798
this approach appreciate you sharing

1160
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:07,279
that with us today okay so we actually

1161
00:50:04,798 --> 00:50:09,280

1162
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,760
