deep

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,080
i want to talk about how the podcast is

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,120
doing and what's up coming in the future

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,199
bricks in a nutshell is going to

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,718
improve your flavor it's going to

7
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,640

00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:18,879
it's going to improve your shelf life

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,839
and even have some ipm

10
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,239
benefits to it it's going to be lower at

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,079
night

12
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,919
because again it's sending some of those

13
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,759
sugars down to the roots for the

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,599
microbes for exudates so

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,320
you'll see that your brix levels will

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,280
drop at night growing methods do play a

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,159
role in this

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,480
it's found that organic growing tends to

19
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,319
be

20
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,558
a little bit more conducive to higher

21
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,878
brix levels it's a good

22
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,599
assistant to looking at the health of

23
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:47,839
your plant

24
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,840

all right so the very first episode of

80
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,200
this podcast if you listen to it on one

81
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,280
of the podcast platforms

82
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,719
then you heard my vision for the podcast

83
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,560
i did not say what the vision was for

84
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,639
the podcast in the first episode on

85
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,479
youtube so i want to reiterate my vision

86
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,119
for this podcast right now and i'm going

87
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,799
to read it

88
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,560
my vision for this podcast is to talk

89
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,120
with growers from all over the world

90
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,479
both beginners and experts and seek to

91
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,280
learn more about what they know about

92
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,399
gardening

93
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,000
i'm not going to judge people for the

94
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,640
way that they grow and this isn't a

95
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,318
debate

96
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,079
i'm simply seeking to learn more about

97
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:02,719
the guest and what they know about

98
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,560
gardening

99
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,479
and how they do things in their garden

100
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,318
my vision is for these conversations to

101
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,479
not only help expand my knowledge

102
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,839
but you the listeners knowledge too i

103
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,679
feel like that vision

104
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,360
we've done it so far here up to episode

105
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,800
25 but there's one thing i'd like to add

106
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,720
is that this podcast is for

107
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,640
all plants i don't want to narrow down

108
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,359
the scope to just that plant that we all

109
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,359
know and love

110
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,200
many grow techniques are the same or

111
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,640
very similar from plant to plant and i

112
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,639
hope that incorporating all plants into

113
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,878
this podcast will help inspire you to

114
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,958
grow other plants such as vegetables

115
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,798
fruits or even house plants i feel that

116
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,360
all plants should be treated the same

117
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,879
now

118
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,400
youtube doesn't agree with me on that

119
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:39,840
one i'm sure there's some people that

120
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,680
are listening that don't agree with me

121
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,519
on that one but i believe all plants

122
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,120
should be treated equally i understand

123
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,799
that laws need to be changed in the

124
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,799
future in order for that to happen

125
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,959
but i do see that happening sometime in

126
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,319
the future may not be in my lifetime may

127
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,158
not be in your lifetime

128
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,679
but sometime in the future since this

129
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,479
podcast is for all plants

130
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,319
it's a clean podcast youtube has rules

131
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,759
and guidelines that need to be followed

132
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,000
in order for the video to not get

133
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,318
suppressed no excessive swearing

134
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,199
no excessive use of certain words no

135
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,119
smoking

136
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,639
no showing certain plants if we can

137
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,920
follow those rules then the podcast will

138
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,679
stay in good standing

139
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,958
and we can reach more people it's also

140
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,799
kind of done as a big

141
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,160
f you to youtube we'll follow the rules

142
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,519
that you put in place

143
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,720
we're going to keep fighting the fight

144
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,160
thank you to everyone who is

145
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,320

that uh

221
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,038

growers indoors

226
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:46,959

00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,519
is

235
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,719
an introduction so can you tell us a

236
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,478
little bit about yourself and kind of

237
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,840
how you got into gardening

238
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:07,279
yeah my name is uh chad westport and uh

239
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:10,719
i've been gardening

240
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,000
for quite a few years now um this is

241
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,039
something that i've had a

242
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,800
passion for many

243
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:22,000
many years uh kind of my background

244
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,520
is a lot of traditional gardening

245
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,680
your vegetables outside um i've taken a

246
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,318
lot of this knowledge i've moved it into

247
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,280
kind of medicinal plants you can apply

248
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,400
that there

249
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,038
and to kind of further that i jumped out

250
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,159
of my

251
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,680
previous life in audio engineering i

252
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,639
went back to school

253
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,199
i did sustainable agriculture and farm

254
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,560
systems

255
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,919
program and that really taught me a lot

256
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,639
of knowledge

257
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,079
that i feel i can use going forward in

258
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,000
this new industry

259
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,000
and it's great because a lot of the

260
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,160
things just like bricks bricks is

261
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,120
you know a couple hundred years old

262
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,160
basically

263
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,000
um but there's a lot of things applied

264
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,319
in um traditional agriculture

265
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,519
that we can use here and so that's the

266
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,560
kind of my background

267
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:15,680
it's gone for a full full circle

268
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,478
sorry uh from starting out as just the

269
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,199
uh

270
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:21,038
experimental gardener to uh having fun

271
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,919
and knowing a little bit more with it

272
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,120
nice nice and i know i think i first

273
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,439
heard about you

274
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,800
was from your show so you have a show i

275
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:31,038
don't know how new it is i feel like

276
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,278
it's somewhat new this year i believe

277
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,799
but it's a home grow show that you have

278
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:35,599
uh and that's on the weekends is that

279
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,000
right

280
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,080
yeah it's it's on saturdays it's every

281
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,360
first and third saturday of the month

282
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,839
and what i really wanted to do there was

283
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,000
give everybody exposure to different

284
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,920
styles and different methods

285
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,600
i'm not going to be the person to just

286
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,079
to subscribe to

287
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,000
you have to do it this way i've seen it

288
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,759
done many different ways

289
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,360
and that's what i want to get out to

290
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,319
people because there are there's people

291
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,519
in different climates you know different

292
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,160
soil conditions

293
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,159
some people aren't even using soil and

294
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,360
you might find something that works

295
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,919
better for you

296
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,440
or you know you can see what's smart

297
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,879
about the next person and apply it to

298
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,839
your own style so

299
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,360
that is my goal with that show yes we

300
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,000
have such a similar mindset

301
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,278
i think i say in my videos all the time

302
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,240
about there's so many different ways to

303
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:25,600
do it

304
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,600
it really comes down to personal

305
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,839
preference a lot of the time

306
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,200
and yeah i mean oftentimes people say

307
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,600
hey that's the wrong way to do it

308
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,040
really it's just an alternate way to do

309
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,320
it you're right

310
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,838
so um but i will link chad's show down

311
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,519
in the description section below so you

312
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,120
guys can click on that and tune in

313
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,519
on saturdays so cool all right let's get

314
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,959
into the topic today which is

315
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:54,480
bricks so tell us what is bricks

316
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:57,599
and why is it important well bricks

317
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,759
in a nutshell um it's going to

318
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,200
improve your flavor it's going to

319
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,200
improve your nutrition

320
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,440
it's going to improve your shelf life

321
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,800
and even have some ipm

322
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,560
benefits to it so bricks

323
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:14,958
is commonly associated with sugar levels

324
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,399
in a plant and you hear a lot of it from

325
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,919
the wine industry you know you got to

326
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,600
check the grapes the nice grapes make

327
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:23,360
the nice sweet wines

328
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,159
um but it's more than just sugars

329
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,039
bricks is really a measure of sugars of

330
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,399
course

331
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:33,599
but also vitamins minerals proteins

332
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:37,759
and other solids inside of the plant

333
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,759
sugar being the most abundant obviously

334
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,600
but having good brix levels again

335
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,079
is going to lead to healthier crops

336
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,720
better crops harvested at the right time

337
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,359
and kind of for what we're talking about

338
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,200
uh

339
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,759
ipm a good or a plant with good brix

340
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,040
levels

341
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,200
is going to stand a better chance

342
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,039
against pests and so that's why it's

343
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,360
pretty important for what we're doing

344
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,319
gotcha now how do you how do you measure

345
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,879
bricks

346
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,839
okay so bricks is something where you're

347
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,799
gonna take like

348
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,240
the sap or the liquid from um sometimes

349
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,078
you can take it from the fruit uh

350
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,440
directly from like a grape say

351
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:18,399
or if there is no fruit you can use leaf

352
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,839
samples so you kind of crush up your

353
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,720
leaves and you get a little bit of the

354
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,959
sample

355
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,600
and you get that liquid and you put it

356
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:28,000
in what is called a refractometer

357
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,159
the refractometers are what you use to

358
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,320
measure the bricks levels

359
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,559
they come in all shapes and sizes and

360
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,480
price ranges you can go

361
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,799
anywhere from like twenty dollars to two

362
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,600
hundred dollars buying a meter

363
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,199
a lot of them you can get our handheld

364
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,560
which is nice because again if you're

365
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,879
going out into the field and you're

366
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,239
measuring bricks levels on crops

367
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,519
you have something that you can bring

368
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,680
with you you can do it right there on

369
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,399
the spot in the field

370
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,399
so if i almost say it's almost kind of

371
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,278
like a little telescope

372
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,839
with the uh recorder mouthpiece on one

373
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:01,759
side

374
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,240
how it's kind of like hollowed out and

375
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,759
that's where you put your liquid in

376
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,480
so you get your liquid you put it in the

377
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:12,000
refractometer and it shines a light

378
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:15,440
up through the liquid and based

379
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,078
on you know doing this a number of times

380
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,120
the way that the light refracts or bends

381
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:21,278
through the liquid

382
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,720
is how they're able to tell what your

383
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:25,600
brix levels are

384
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,200
gotcha i'm looking at a couple on amazon

385
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,920
right now i actually had a few

386
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,120
on my wish list been meaning to buy one

387
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,000
of these actually just haven't pulled

388
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,560
the trigger yet

389
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,559
one of them here is 17.99 it looks just

390
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,199
exactly like you had explained it

391
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:39,599
and then there's one another one which

392
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,079
is

393
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,920
a hundred and forty nine dollars and so

394
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,519
there's some definitely a big price

395
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,078
difference like you had mentioned

396
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,200
this 149 dollar one looks like it has

397
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,359
like a digital

398
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,000
readout on it so do you know anything

399
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,240
about like just the price difference

400
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,120
you know digital readout versus just the

401
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,360
regular one

402
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,120
is it worth it really for a home grower

403
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,240
to be spending 150

404
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,159
for a bricks refractometer i don't i

405
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,680
don't really think that you need to go

406
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:12,000
overboard with this it's a good

407
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,799
assistant to looking at the health of

408
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,519
your plant

409
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:17,199
it's not necessarily you know the doctor

410
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,078
that's looking

411
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,519
at everything combined so i i do say

412
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:22,239
it's important but i don't think you

413
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,480
need to go

414
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,959
overboard either kind of like you said

415
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,720
there are the digital displays which yes

416
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,759
they're going to be more accurate

417
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,079
um than than a moving dial

418
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,278
and and really the levels that we're

419
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,679
talking about

420
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,600
um i guess it depends on how much the

421
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,759
hands on the dial are spread out because

422
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,360
if it has like a plus or minus

423
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,360
of three uh for the margin of error

424
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,839
that three can actually make a big

425
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,680
difference kind of from the

426
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,240
not from the bottom of the scale but

427
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:57,519
from the top of the poor

428
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,879
section to where the optimal section is

429
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,560
is really about five points so

430
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,519
again it depends on what the plus or

431
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,078
minus is on that readout so spending a

432
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,198
little more

433
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,479
is beneficial for that aspect um another

434
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,799
thing that you'll find

435
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,079
too probably with the 150 dollar versus

436
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:18,078
the 17

437
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:20,559
is uh bricks was measured or calculated

438
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:23,039
to take place at 68 degrees

439
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,399
so and just how the refract the

440
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,639
refraction

441
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,440
of the light works is meant to be at 68

442
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,639
degrees

443
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,160
and a lot of these will take that into

444
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,360
account do the math and then show you

445
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,519
the accurate number

446
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,560
some of them won't there's a chart

447
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,399
online you can go

448
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,000
type in your error temperature and all

449
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,958
that and it you figure out pretty

450
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,440
quickly but that

451
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,319
also is probably a differentiator of

452
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,560
cost

453
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,639
okay and so when i'm taking measurements

454
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,518
and just back up i know you you briefly

455
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,278
explained it is

456
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,198
you're basically going to take off a

457
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:54,000
piece of the leaf now correct me if i'm

458
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,399
wrong it should be

459
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,839
one of the newer leafs on the plant and

460
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,039
then you're basically going to squeeze

461
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,240
it what would you use to like

462
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,958
squeeze it and get that sap or whatever

463
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,079
to drip

464
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,518
off some sometimes if you are breaking

465
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,638
um like the petioles

466
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,240
the stems going to the leaf you can get

467
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,639
some sap out of that

468
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,480
um also times there's you know depending

469
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,759
upon the sample size you need

470
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,920
uh pistol and mortar kind of crush

471
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,519
stuff up that way it takes a lot more so

472
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:24,479
you're doing a larger sample size in

473
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,198
that case

474
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,480
but yeah usually uh if the plant has

475
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,559
been hydrated

476
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,759
uh recently you're able to kind of crack

477
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,838
it off there

478
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,120
uh on the stem from the leaf and you can

479
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,160
get a good sample

480
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,120
okay and then as far as

481
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,958
the ideal brix level or bricks range

482
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,879
that you want to be in i've heard

483
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,638
uh one of the things i've learned from

484
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,480
harley smith shout out to him

485
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,120
i took his master growers course last

486
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,519
year and he had mentioned that

487
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,198
plants with a brix level over 12 pests

488
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:59,519
won't even recognize it

489
00:15:55,198 --> 00:16:01,919
so what is the ideal brix level or range

490
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,399
yeah you you've nailed it 12 is the

491
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,399
ideal level that's kind of the goal

492
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,320
i've heard you know medicinal plants

493
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,440
ranging up to 15

494
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,399
potentially 18. i haven't verified that

495
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,680
myself

496
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,120
but 12 really is the good goal and like

497
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,319
i said earlier you know

498
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,440
five points distinguishes from ideal to

499
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,240
the top of the bad points so seven when

500
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,839
you're at seven

501
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,440
and down that's when things aren't

502
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,079
looking too good

503
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,160
so staying at 12 is ideal and there was

504
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,319
a study that was done

505
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,439
where one field was treated and had high

506
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,600
bricks

507
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,360
it came in at 12 the field next to it

508
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,600
didn't and it had low bricks

509
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,879
and there were insect pressures that

510
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,879
came

511
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,039
leaf hoppers i believe it was and they

512
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,120
totally bypassed the field with the

513
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,439
higher bricks went to the other one

514
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,198
and so a study came out based on that

515
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,639
that if you have 12

516
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:57,838
you're basically invisible um that has

517
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,159
kind of that's been

518
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,720
not necessarily disputed but it's been

519
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:06,240
argued that it is

520
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,318
not a magic number but again

521
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,240
if you and and here's the kind of the

522
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:13,438
crux of it

523
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,519
insects and diseases like weaker plants

524
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,558
so if you have a field of healthy plants

525
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,519
next to a field

526
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:22,160
of unhealthy plants insect pressure is

527
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,599
going to go to that unhealthy field

528
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,439
and so that's kind of what happened

529
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,318
there it wasn't necessarily the bricks

530
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,000
itself

531
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,159
that made them leave it was just like

532
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,960
hey this is an easier target let's go

533
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,160
over here

534
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,480
so what can folks do to increase bricks

535
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,200
levels say they're in that danger zone

536
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,720
right

537
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,720
what are some of the things that they

538
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,679
can do in order to increase and get up

539
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,798
to that 12

540
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,960
or above four bricks level well

541
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,160
it all kind of starts in the beginning

542
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,200
with your original plan

543
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,400
growing methods do play a role

544
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,960
in this uh it's found that organic

545
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,120
growing

546
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,960
tends to be a little bit more conducive

547
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:02,079
to higher brix levels

548
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,160
and one of the key components in both

549
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:07,678
cases there is just the microbial

550
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,038
activity and a lot of times in the

551
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,480
synthetic

552
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:12,480
based diets

553
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,918
it doesn't give the the you know the

554
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,000
ideal

555
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,919
or the conducive environment for those

556
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,960
microbes to grow and thrive

557
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,440
and do what they need to do um so

558
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,319
by growing organically that is going to

559
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,798
help you because

560
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,359
you know the microbes are there the

561
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,440
fungi

562
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:35,918
is there the organic material is there

563
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,440
and that's that's gonna kind of help

564
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,640
everything really

565
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,919
um in a nutshell there's also lighting

566
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,559
um dli or you know the intensity of the

567
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,480
light

568
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:47,599
that's important too because we know

569
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,160
that you know

570
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:52,319
proper lighting drives photosynthesis

571
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,120
photosynthesis creates sugars in the

572
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:55,918
plants

573
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,319
and again sugars relates backs to bricks

574
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,559
so

575
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:59,918
by having good and proper lighting it's

576
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,319
more photosynthesis

577
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,840
it's more sugar for the plant and that

578
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,159
can get distributed

579
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,279
uh to different areas and for different

580
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,360
purposes

581
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,038
so yeah kind of kind of starts with the

582
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:15,119
the soil microbes

583
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:18,879
um calcium is another important one

584
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:21,119
and and i'm leaving cal mag off of that

585
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,880
magnesium does come into the equation

586
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,000
here but i'm just saying calcium at this

587
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,720
point

588
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,759
because calcium it helps build stronger

589
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,720
cell walls

590
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,640
in the plants and you know that

591
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,360
increases the movement in the xylem and

592
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,000
phloem

593
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,439
the more things coming up uh because

594
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,400
sugars and bricks

595
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,480
it's it's a two-way street you know the

596
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,759
sugars and stuff are coming up

597
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,839
uh through the root zone and from the

598
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,400
plants and the photosynthesis

599
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,038
but they're also going back down the

600
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,880
plant

601
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:57,679
at night um to feed the microbes

602
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,080
so kind of a symbiotic relationship

603
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,080
there

604
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,359
again that's that's you know it's kind

605
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:05,279
of important

606
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:08,558
um getting the right amount of

607
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:10,079
calcium in there is important

608
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,599
you don't want to overload it just

609
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,158
because hey it's good it builds

610
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:16,480
thick walls i'm going to have amazing

611
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,120
stocks on all my plants

612
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,000
there are antagonistic properties to it

613
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,000
you know if you have

614
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,519
too much calcium in there you're likely

615
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,880
to lock out

616
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,759
phosphorus or potassium and then that

617
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,880
creates

618
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:33,200
a different kind of problem because

619
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,640
diagnosing plants for me is always one

620
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,720
of the trickier things because

621
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,840
is it truly a deficiency you're seeing

622
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,880
or is it a

623
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:43,439
lockout situation due to

624
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,039
you know the ions the cations and ions

625
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,640
from other minerals

626
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:52,400
or just a ph problem so

627
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,600
yeah that that kind of gets uh

628
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,440
gets tricky when you're trying to

629
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:57,038
diagnose them so don't put on a whole

630
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,840
bunch of calcium just because i said it

631
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:59,519
was good

632
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,759
uh like everything there is always a

633
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,079
balance so you don't want to lock other

634
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,759
things

635
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:08,240
out and so you separated calcium and

636
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:08,798
magnesium and you know calm a lot of

637
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,759
people just

638
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:13,279
uh say cal mag and they think that's a

639
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:14,720
nutrient in itself

640
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,639
when really that's just the name of a

641
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,720
product right there's calcium in it

642
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,720
there's magnesium in it oftentimes it's

643
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,720
nitrogen in it as well

644
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,798
so talking about calcium in particular

645
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,120
do you have any recommendations for just

646
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:29,038
straight calcium that they can give to

647
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:32,319
their plants

648
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,038
um yeah i mean in kind of like an

649
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:36,399
organic

650
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:38,558
type method there's a lot of different

651
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,519
options you could use um gypsum is a

652
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:41,599
good one

653
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,319
uh gypsum is something that doesn't

654
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,639
really affect the soil ph

655
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:47,759
so that's always kind of nice and that

656
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,200
is something that you're probably going

657
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,240
to add in

658
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,120
while you're making your mix if i were

659
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,038
to

660
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:57,678
you know spot like a little deficiency

661
00:21:55,038 --> 00:22:01,200
or if i wanted to top dress something

662
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,679
in an organic method there is a wca

663
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,319
which is something i saw from chris

664
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,120
trump

665
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,839
uh i i don't know if it's jadam or or

666
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,519
which

667
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:12,240
farming method it came from but

668
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,480
essentially uh calcium bicarbonate

669
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,440
that is shells so there's you know

670
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,519
eggshells

671
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,038
oyster shells crab shells all those

672
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,158
different ones you can use

673
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:23,679
at home a lot of people have eggs so you

674
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,760
essentially

675
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,679
and i believe it's one part of eggshells

676
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:30,158
to 10 parts of white vinegar

677
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,000
you mix the two and i'm glossing over

678
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,159
this of course but you mix the two you

679
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,919
let it sit for about 10 days

680
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,200
it extracts the calcium from the shells

681
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,840
and then you can pour it on

682
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,759
and that's a good organic treatment that

683
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:43,678
you can use at home

684
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,038
and you know for for synthetic growers

685
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,360
there's always uh

686
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,319
there's a lot of bottled calcium out

687
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,158
there

688
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,480
and again even if you are doing

689
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,360
synthetic i wouldn't shy away from

690
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,759
you know calcium bicarbonate methods or

691
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,359
uh

692
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,158
gypsum either so always good now when

693
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,199
should

694
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,240
uh measurements be taken right so

695
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,080
you know i'm sure there'll be

696
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,839
homegrowers here that are going to go

697
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,038
and buy a brix refractometer and they're

698
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:11,359
going to be measuring

699
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,400
uh taking measurements you know should

700
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,399
they do it every day

701
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,440
should they do it every week should they

702
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,919
do it

703
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,038
at morning should they do it at night so

704
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,280
if you give us a little

705
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:23,759
a little background on when uh and how

706
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,440
often measurements should be taken

707
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,440
yeah that's that's a great question

708
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,480
because it does have an impact

709
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,440
on the readings you're going to get you

710
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,919
want to

711
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,279
to start out you want to do it at the

712
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,919
same time

713
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:38,879
every time you measure it it's going to

714
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,880
be lower

715
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,320
at night because again it's sending some

716
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,080
of those sugars down

717
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:45,519
to the roots for the microbes for

718
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:47,359
exudates so

719
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:48,879
you'll see that your brix levels will

720
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,879
drop at night

721
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,919
if you're outdoors know again with like

722
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,159
row crops

723
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:58,320
um if it's a cloudy day

724
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,440
you'll have lower brix levels again

725
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:02,558
light defects

726
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,278
can affect bricks but yeah

727
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:07,038
you can do it as often as you want to i

728
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,880
don't think you'll glean much if you do

729
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:12,319
it on a month-to-month basis

730
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,919
um not terrible lot changes on a

731
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:17,599
day-to-day basis

732
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:19,278
but weekly i think is a good idea

733
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,519
you could do it you know maybe every

734
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:23,919
four days if you're a data freak like me

735
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,000
and you like plotting charts and

736
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,159
doing all of that stuff but yeah

737
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,480
basically doing it once a week

738
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,520
i prefer to do it midday that's the best

739
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,759
time to do it and

740
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,759
like you kind of alluded to yes make

741
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:38,000
sure you're doing it at the same time

742
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,359
every time you do it otherwise it's just

743
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,679
going to be inaccurate

744
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:43,278
for your purposes good advice definitely

745
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,080
some good advice there

746
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,720
now you wrote a pretty extensive article

747
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:48,720
on

748
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,558
dude grow show website i'm looking at it

749
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,200
right now for those that are tuning in

750
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:53,918
on

751
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,960
apple podcast spotify you can just

752
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,640
search google

753
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,120
it's called high science what the brix

754
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,960
an explainer of bricks and soil health

755
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:03,918
so pretty long here you get into details

756
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,079
i know we went over

757
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,159
quite a bit here in this talk but

758
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,839
there's one more thing in here

759
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,840
you talked about how during

760
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,959
photosynthesis chlorophyll

761
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:16,879
manufactures sugars it also says that

762
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,640
humic and fulvic acids are a great way

763
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,760
to make iron in the soil more plant

764
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,000
available

765
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,879
can you talk to us about specifically

766
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,038
about

767
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,039
humic and fulvic acids and kind of how

768
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:28,558
this relates to bricks and how you know

769
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:29,359
it can increase uptake and so on and so

770
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,079
forth

771
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:33,199
yeah um so the humic and the fulvic

772
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:36,399
acids they act

773
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,200
within the soil as kind of like

774
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,120
chelators

775
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,960
they help basically i mentioned earlier

776
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:47,678
the ions cations and ions they

777
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,720
um from like calcium will have and part

778
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,038
of me for not being

779
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,440
overly scientific here but you know you

780
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:55,200
can all picture like the oxygen molecule

781
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,038
it has you know the bubble with a little

782
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,720
stem and another bubble

783
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:00,240
it's kind of the cations and ions the

784
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,360
positive and negative charges that we're

785
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,359
talking about

786
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:06,959
and sometimes nutrients will

787
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,038
see each other bind and then they'll

788
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,159
lock each other out so

789
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:14,798
the humex the phobics they kind of blind

790
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,559
everything to that so that also kind of

791
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,639
relates to amino acids i know you

792
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:19,599
mentioned that in the article here as

793
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,440
well can you talk to us a little bit

794
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:24,158
about amino acids

795
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,400
yeah amino acids are great amino acids

796
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,799
are essentially the building blocks of

797
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,880
kind of all life

798
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:35,679
and the amino acids uh create protein

799
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,278
and to create that within a plant system

800
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:41,360
or the plant structure

801
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:43,200
that takes sugars so if you're using

802
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:45,599
your sugar energy

803
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,038
and amino acids to build protein then

804
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,599
you have less sugar

805
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,440
in there for higher brix and other

806
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,759
things that you're going to want it for

807
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,278
so by adding these amino acids you're

808
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,480
really kind of

809
00:26:55,278 --> 00:27:02,159
not cheating the system but you're

810
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:05,120
you're taking away that draw of sugars

811
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,720
or in the energy form so by adding those

812
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,199
amino acids

813
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,839
you get the protein and similar to the

814
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,679
uh the humic and fulvic acids

815
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:17,839
um it can act as a chelator um

816
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,880
basically making more of the nutrients

817
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:21,278
available

818
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,278
in the soil to the plant and they're

819
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:24,159
able to move around more freely within

820
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:26,319
the plant

821
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,360
so that's again another very important

822
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,879
aspect

823
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,599
the calcium is kind of building the

824
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,360
walls the phosphorus is the truck

825
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:36,639
driving everything around

826
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:39,038
and the hum or humic fulvic acid

827
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,000
uh are the things that are helping blind

828
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:42,398
it to

829
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,119
freely get to where it needs to go

830
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:44,719
gotcha

831
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,798
okay so is there anything else in

832
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,200
regards to bricks that growers should

833
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,960
know

834
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,480
or maybe do you have any advice for

835
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,679
somebody who's kind of new to bricks

836
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,079
they're just starting measurements for

837
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,720
the first time what advice do you have

838
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:58,960
yeah i want to say that brix is a good

839
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,600
reinforcement of a lot of times what you

840
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,120
can see

841
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,119
with your eyes you know if your plants

842
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,278
are looking healthy and you check your

843
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,918
bricks and it comes back around that 12

844
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:08,000
level

845
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,000
that's great if you're looking at the

846
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,839
plants they're not looking

847
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,599
healthy you check the bricks it's at

848
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,678
that five or six range

849
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,759
you can almost infer from that that

850
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,880
you're having an issue with calcium

851
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:23,038
so that's an important thing to know and

852
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,200
to kind of help you

853
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:27,599
on the road to improving your brix

854
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,600
levels

855
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,440
it's not the you know it's not the

856
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,159
end-all be-all of

857
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,240
of what's in your soil it's not going to

858
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,679
isolate specifically

859
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,200
what nutrient is in what ratio something

860
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,720
uh like a sap analysis

861
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,679
test uh can do that for you but bricks

862
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,120
again you you want to know what your

863
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,600
brix levels are

864
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,398
because it can indicate the nutritional

865
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,759
levels

866
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:59,119
in your plant uh it's also going to

867
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:02,319
indicate you know how good your uh ipm

868
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:05,038
can be or you know avoidance of pests

869
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:07,038
so it's important to know it's it's

870
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,200

typically youtube sometimes doesn't like

926
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,520
this podcast so that's why there's a

927
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,440
delay in release

928
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:58,960
from time to time apple podcast if

929
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,278
