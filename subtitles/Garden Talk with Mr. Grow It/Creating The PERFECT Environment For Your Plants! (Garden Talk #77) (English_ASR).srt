1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,199
coming up on garden talk my favorite

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,919
thing

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:08,638
are wi-fi switches these little wi-fi

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,480
switches change the game for me because

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,959
you can put schedules on there feeding

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,960
schedules you can turn pumps on and off

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,440
you can turn lights on and off

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,199
the main goal is to get the leaf

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,880
temperature at a certain temp so

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,679
basically in veg i want my leaf

11
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,919
temperature to be at 83 and so i'll

12
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,518
adjust the ambient temperature to what

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,840
matches the leaf temperature we're

14
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,159
humans we forget no matter what you know

15
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,799
so anytime you can put a machine in

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,479
there doing something it's just one less

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,199
thing to worry about

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,599
four week veg was kind of my norm

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,840
now it's like two weeks and it's already

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,480
too much i mean they just grow so much

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,800
faster so much stronger

22
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,799
it's it's it's vital it's so important

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,280
what's up everybody if you that don't

97
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,158
you on we've been talking for the past

98
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,920
little over a year i think we were

99
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:45,919
supposed to have you on over a year ago

100
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,679
and uh now we're finally getting you on

101
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,000
so we're gonna be talking all about

102
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,400
environment right so talking about

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,959
creating the perfect environment for

104
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,039
your plants and uh it's easier said than

105
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,719
done right you know particularly growing

106
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,079
indoors that's what we're gonna focus on

107
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,479
outdoors you don't really have control

108
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,319
of the environment so indoors but first

109
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,840
before we get deep into environment

110
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,518
introduction can you tell us a little

111
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,759
bit about yourself and how you got into

112
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,799
gardening yeah uh so i've been growing

113
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:15,199
kind of on and off for about 16 years

114
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,358
i got really into it when

115
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,439
uh when i was young my my folks actually

116
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,358
used to have a garden in the backyard

117
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,360
and they used to grow uh just all kinds

118
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,240
of vegetables and stuff like that but

119
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,600
one time my grandpa i saw him

120
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:33,280
take a branch from a fig tree and

121
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,520
literally splice it into this pear tree

122
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,719
and it just and with some tape and it

123
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:41,039
just kind of it just blew my mind and it

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,440
just kind of fascinated me uh and then

125
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,040
once i got introduced to uh

126
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,000
medical plants

127
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,400
um

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,680
i got really into it and started trying

129
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,560
to figure out

130
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,400
how

131
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,959
it does what it does

132
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,719
and why it does what it does and i just

133
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,198
wanted to

134
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,479
just really dive into it and so at a

135
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,319
really young age when i was about 17

136
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,038
um i built like

137
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,639
a deep water culture system

138
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,199
and i was just growing with hydro i

139
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,038
started with soil i had no idea what i

140
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,639
was doing by the way so

141
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,759
i mean it was

142
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,560
before youtube before mr grow it you

143
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,400
know

144
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,560
and so uh

145
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,918
so i learned a lot about

146
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,759
what not to do and so i mean that was

147
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,279
sometimes that's better than learning

148
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,560
what to do you know

149
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,319
uh

150
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,280
and so then um

151
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,959
i i studied architecture uh i have

152
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,959
engineering background

153
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:43,038
and with that i'm able to to think of it

154
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,879
to you know to approach it in an

155
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:49,279
engineering like standpoint

156
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,439
i'm really into

157
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,119
building the right environment i think

158
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,959
that's

159
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,918
that's that's key

160
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,279
um you can have you know two different

161
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:02,159
type of plants

162
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,758
and or the same the same type of plant

163
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,600
in two different environments and they

164
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,360
would you know they'll grow completely

165
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,759
different

166
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,038
um and so yeah i i

167
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,280
went to dubai about 12 years ago

168
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,959
or say so i kind of stopped uh growing

169
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,519
for a while

170
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,638
but when things started becoming legal i

171
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,159
uh

172
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,519
i got back into it and started

173
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,479
researching and i felt ready to go and

174
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,399
came out here to good old oklahoma

175
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,318
uh to you know

176
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,719
get in the industry and this was about

177
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,000
almost two years ago um since then

178
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,400
i've been

179
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,120
designing grow facilities i've been

180
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:46,079
working as a consultant in um

181
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,319
in farms and uh big indoor facilities as

182
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,318
well

183
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,160
and just really now i'm getting into

184
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,879
packaging so i'm doing a lot of

185
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,319
packaging stuff stickers and things like

186
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:57,360
that as well

187
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,160
um

188
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,439
and yeah and that's kind of

189
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,360
you know

190
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,279
what i've been doing

191
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,439
in this industry that's awesome yeah but

192
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,799
when we first connected before we

193
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,959
started recording you had mentioned that

194
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,038
you've been gardening for 16 years off

195
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:15,038
and on so you've got a quite a bit of

196
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,560
experience there and the fact that

197
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:17,439
you've actually worked all your way up

198
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,598
into

199
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,000
working with commercial facilities

200
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:24,319
and doing the environment for those

201
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,240
facilities pretty impressive not many

202
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,520
people that are better than you to talk

203
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,478
about this huh especially with their

204
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,799
engineering background i know

205
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,360
yeah it goes hand in hand i didn't think

206
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,400
when i was uh you know getting my degree

207
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,639
that i'd be using it mostly for this

208
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,839
and it's been you know

209
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,840
uh

210
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,478
really helpful actually so before we get

211
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,159
too deep what's your style of gardening

212
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,318
i like to ask this kind of before we get

213
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,639
deep into the topic you know are you

214
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,560
indoors mostly outdoors

215
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,439
what type of medium are you typically in

216
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,720
are you organic grower synthetic what's

217
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,038
your style

218
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,400
so i don't really have a style person

219
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,598
i'm still kind of trying to figure that

220
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:08,560
out still i'm still r d um

221
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:10,800
there's still so much more to learn

222
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,598
and so i don't really i guess have a

223
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,639
style i grow in in cocoa mostly

224
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:19,279
um so i guess that would kind of be it

225
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:23,360
um at the farm we we're doing uh living

226
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:24,839
soil beds as well as using athena uh

227
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,120
salts and synthetics in another

228
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,119
greenhouse um

229
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,560
so i'm trying to pretty much learn as

230
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,759
much as i can about everything we're

231
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,200
doing autoflower outdoors now

232
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,639
um

233
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,640
and that this that's the first time i'm

234
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,799
doing that so i'm really excited to see

235
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,519
how that comes out

236
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,278
indoor for sure is the best

237
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,278
i mean

238
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,200
for all kinds of reasons

239
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,120
and

240
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,360
greenhouses are just

241
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,200
insane it's just the being out here in

242
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,600
oklahoma with the weather

243
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,440
that it's just so bipolar one day it's

244
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,080
hot one day it's cold one day it's humid

245
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,560
one day it's like no humidity at all and

246
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,360
so it's just um

247
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,639
trying to keep up with the environment

248
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,720
um

249
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,480
and yeah but i started with deep water

250
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,278
culture that's what i've been doing

251
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,839
since i was young i loved just hydro it

252
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:19,039
was uh it just made a lot a lot of sense

253
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,040
and

254
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,439
uh now with with

255
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,799
commercial size facilities and stuff

256
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,120
like that

257
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,319
you know i think coco

258
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,639
is pretty good and i'm getting into

259
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,560
rockwool now with just rockwell cubes so

260
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,080
i'm excited about that too

261
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,000
so you definitely tried out a big

262
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,240
handful of things in there and you got

263
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,399
experience doing several different ways

264
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,440
which is pretty cool grow room let's get

265
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,120
into that describe your grow room setup

266
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,680
right so say you walk into your grow

267
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,519
room maybe you know how big is the grow

268
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,278
room how many plants you're running name

269
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,560
off some of the equipment you run so on

270
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:55,919
and so forth

271
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,479
um so i got a

272
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,439
like my home grow i got a like a 20 by

273
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,920
10.

274
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,399
i'm running 12 uh six

275
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,958
six mature plants and six immature

276
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,320
plants that i stress train a lot i do it

277
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,838
completely different than i would in a

278
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,519
commercial grow

279
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,120
in the sense that i'm just topping and

280
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,799
filming and doing all these things that

281
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,639
i wouldn't normally do

282
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,439
per se as much of

283
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:21,278
uh in in a commercial setting and so

284
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,000
uh you know just trying to maximize the

285
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,919
yield and more colas and and things like

286
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,278
that uh i

287
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,799
i do everything drip system with coco

288
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:34,078
let it run down

289
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:36,479
uh a table that's about 10 feet

290
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,799
and it drains out into a gutter that

291
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,000
goes into a condensation pump that kicks

292
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,838
it out

293
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,320
um

294
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,519
i love it because it's so easy to

295
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,879
control like it's just it stays

296
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,560
consistent

297
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:53,039
and i got

298
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,639
ac ducts coming in i got three of them

299
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,838
coming in

300
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,159
um

301
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,399
uh think grow leds

302
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,159
are the lights that i use

303
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,879
they're amazing

304
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,278
they have really good dli control

305
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:09,838
with a troll master

306
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:12,259
i'm using fluoroflex

307
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,440
drippers

308
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:16,958
[Music]

309
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,440
i even have a di tank and an ro tank

310
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,278
as well so i'm using ro water and i'm

311
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,399
running athena

312
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,519
uh

313
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,480
i started using athena and it was just

314
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,159
it just makes things so much easier and

315
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,000
when i'm trying to juggle so many things

316
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,799
at once it's easy to just come in and

317
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
just

318
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:38,159
mix it up real quick and go

319
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,559
i have

320
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,759
two 55 gallon drums one collects the ro

321
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,719
and uh

322
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:49,200
and then i have a mix tank also that has

323
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,600
a pump that i have uh like a timer on

324
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,278
and so the timer kicks it on and

325
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,720
and feeds about four or five times a day

326
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,639
um

327
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,839
and yeah

328
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,320
i got some fans for circulation

329
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,240
uh co2 is huge

330
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,959
that is like

331
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,879
the number one thing

332
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,879
uh

333
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,399
well there is no number one thing i i

334
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,600
don't even like saying that's the number

335
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,078
one thing because they're all like

336
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,720
equally as important what about grow

337
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,638
room monitor what do you use as like a

338
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,600
monitor to monitor like your temperature

339
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:29,200
humidity vpd co2 all that stuff

340
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,600
so i use for co2 i have an autopilot

341
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,160
controller regulator

342
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,440
i find that it works great

343
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,919
with a titan

344
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,240
regulator on it

345
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:43,120
for for my lights and stuff like that i

346
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,000
have a troll master

347
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,120
for the irrigation i have uh also a

348
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,480
troll master the aqua x controller

349
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,120
and

350
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,399
i have ink birds that

351
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,560
uh turn the humidifiers on

352
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,320
um i have a little dehu in there that's

353
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:04,399
uh pretty much constantly running so i'm

354
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:07,760
constantly dehumidifying and humidifying

355
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,679
kinda at the same time it just it stays

356
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,159
pretty consistent

357
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,919
um

358
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,879
[Music]

359
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,479
and i have i use like sensor push uh

360
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,879
little uh uh

361
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,639
sensors

362
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:24,480
uh my favorite thing are wifi switches

363
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,278
now this thing these little wi-fi

364
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,120
switches change the game for me because

365
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:31,600
you can put schedules on there feeding

366
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,320
schedules you can turn pumps on and off

367
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,480
you can turn lights on and off um and

368
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,839
i'm basically able to control it from

369
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,079
from anywhere

370
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,680
uh just on my phone so i can fill up the

371
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:45,679
tank the only thing i can't do is just

372
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:47,519
mix the tank i haven't gotten there yet

373
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,278
i don't think i will it's just all i

374
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,039
have to do is mix the tank i mean it's

375
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:53,278
not

376
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,319
i don't have to make it that that easy i

377
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,078
guess

378
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,639
um

379
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:01,359
and yeah i think that's

380
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,480
all the controllers

381
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,278
um pulses

382
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,720
i use the troll master also for my the

383
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:10,799
par meter

384
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,639
and that's that's constantly connected

385
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,639
to the troll master

386
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,120
um and i have uh

387
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,320
also a moisture moisture meter in the

388
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,000
cocoa

389
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,440
that gives me my moisture content

390
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,799
um i think and that's about i think

391
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,040
that's about it

392
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:29,679
okay so very automated getting down to

393
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,759
the nitty-gritty of things temperature

394
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,519
what do you typically aim for for

395
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,278
temperature and how do you control the

396
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,959
temperature

397
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,198
all right so

398
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,759
with temperature depending on whether

399
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:44,319
i'm using hps's or leds

400
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:49,039
it's a whole different philosophy

401
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:52,560
so when it's in hps i do it about in veg

402
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:53,519
of about you know 82 to 85. the main

403
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,359
goal

404
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,159
is to get the leaf temperature at a

405
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,839
certain at a certain uh temp so

406
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:03,039
basically in veg i want my leaf

407
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,279
temperature to be at 83 and so all i'll

408
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,639
adjust the ambient temperature to what

409
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,198
matches the leaf temperature because

410
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,440
that's kind of what i'm going for

411
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:13,679
uh and then and so in veg i want the

412
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,600
leaf temperature to be around 83 and

413
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:20,559
flower around 78.

414
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,320
that's in leds and so with leds i run

415
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,958
the rooms really hot

416
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,959
to get that leaf temperature 83. with

417
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,919
hps you don't have to do it as much

418
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:32,638
because hps's have that have that heat

419
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:35,439
and so with leds i run the rooms at like

420
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,519
88 89

421
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,399
i mean it's it's it's pretty hot but

422
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,639
because i also have co2 in there they're

423
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,799
able to take it like like it's nothing

424
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,480
and they actually you know

425
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,719
love it like that

426
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,240
um

427
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,240
i was all about vpd

428
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,959
um until leds came around and that kind

429
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,120
of

430
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,239
uh you know changed things up a little

431
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,839
bit

432
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,399
um of course

433
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,440
i always try to

434
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,759
get the right you know vpd but with uh

435
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,320
with the room being so hot

436
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,639
you would have to turn the humidity

437
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,079
above 80 sometimes and i don't like to

438
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,399
go above 80 humidity ever just because

439
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:23,359
you know mold can start growing in in

440
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,000
humidities like that so i always keep

441
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,839
keep the humidity low

442
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,958
um

443
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,040
but yeah

444
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,039
that's that's usually how it goes um

445
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,799
it's not too cold i don't really usually

446
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,720
i don't usually like you know flower

447
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,479
with it freezing cold or anything until

448
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,240
the very end i'll drop it down to maybe

449
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,240
72

450
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,560
uh and that's you know

451
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,320
those are the temps i usually like so

452
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,479
when your temperature you said you were

453
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,320
in a real high temps do you have to run

454
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,600
cooling at all are you doing like a

455
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,000
standalone ac or are you doing uh a

456
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,519
central ac in your home or like what are

457
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,439
you doing for cooling

458
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,359
i have central ac that i like i actually

459
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,160
i went up in the attic and

460
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,159
and ducted some ac's

461
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,679
just straight from the ceiling into the

462
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,600
into the tent

463
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,519
and uh and that's been working i mean

464
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,678
pretty great it doesn't matter how i'm

465
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,400
feeling in the house as long as as long

466
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,679
as they're happy

467
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,000
um

468
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,798
and so that's how i'm cooling it

469
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,319
i have a fan that will kick on and and

470
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,879
blow air

471
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:35,678
just into the tent and let some hot air

472
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,440
go out from the from the top

473
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,960
that's kind of how i how i exhaust it

474
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,558
um

475
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,759
i don't like to do that too much i just

476
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:48,319
try to keep the co2 in there

477
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,960
there's there's all kinds of

478
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,319
you know ifs and then butts that you

479
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,720
know

480
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,200
uh change things around

481
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,720
but yeah do you ever get to a point like

482
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,720
sometimes in the winter time for example

483
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,319
where i live it gets cold and i need to

484
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,400
actually add heat even with the grow

485
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,558
lights i'm adding heat so i have a small

486
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,038
heater the space heaters the tower type

487
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,798
heaters do you utilize heat at all do

488
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:14,640
you need to or no

489
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:16,639
uh not really uh usually

490
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,640
it's always fighting

491
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,840
it's always fighting the heat

492
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,640
you know

493
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,879
um now that i've been running my rooms

494
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,360
pretty hot the lights seem to be

495
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,880
sufficient enough uh to provide all that

496
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,479
heat

497
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,400
um

498
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,400
yeah they get they get pretty hot those

499
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,798
think grows in in a small tent you know

500
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,120
but um basically just to control it i

501
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,798
would you know put the lights down

502
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,119
and uh and just turn

503
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:48,798
uh the power down so you get the same

504
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:50,798
ppf's but just use less power and less

505
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:52,639
heat i do the same exact thing yeah in

506
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:54,319
order to control the heat just dip the

507
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,600
lights bring it closer so you're still

508
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,678
getting the same amount of photons at

509
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:59,279
the canopy but you're not generating as

510
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,880
much heat it definitely definitely helps

511
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,359
especially if you have heat problems

512
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,880
yeah exactly and another thing i'm doing

513
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,199
which um

514
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,600
not many people are doing and some

515
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,038
people are calling me crazy

516
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:15,359
but um i have like this dli control

517
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:17,359
and i have it set also to when it goes

518
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,798
to a certain temperature

519
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:20,558
uh that it like

520
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:21,440
it the power goes

521
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:23,359
it

522
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,919
shoots a lot of photons

523
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:29,119
at like 5000 ppf's and then goes back

524
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,320
down to zero and then back 5000 and back

525
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:31,359
to zero

526
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,879
and

527
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,199
it kind of acts

528
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,440
like kind of like clouds like if you're

529
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,679
outside in the sun and you have a par

530
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,960
meter it's never just going to be a

531
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,240
solid number

532
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,038
it's always going to be going up and

533
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,599
down

534
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:48,879
and so i have that going on and it i

535
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:51,519
average out to about 1200 sometimes 1400

536
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,400
ppf's in a day

537
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:57,200
and and that's what i'm shooting for is

538
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,840
is that dli that daily light integral is

539
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,519
how much photons they collect

540
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,720
throughout that day

541
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,798
um

542
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,679
and it doesn't matter how

543
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:09,918
how they're getting those photons

544
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,000
as long as they're not getting too much

545
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,840
and that's been working great and

546
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,640
i like it because some you know when it

547
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:19,359
shoots at a higher ppf it'll get some of

548
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,480
the lower uh you know bud spots and

549
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,918
things like that

550
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,960
as well

551
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,640
um

552
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,558
and it's kind of been working pretty

553
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,960
good i leave the red light on the whole

554
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,960
time like during flower and so what

555
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,240
you'll see is the lights

556
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,159
uh going from white to red white to red

557
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,558
okay so there's temperature that's how

558
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,039
you do the lighting you touched upon

559
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,480
humidity a little bit and i'd like to

560
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:43,440
get a little bit deeper into it you

561
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,599
mentioned that you're running a

562
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,360
dehumidifier and that you're also

563
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:48,879
running a humidifier and they're both

564
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,439
kind of running and kind of balancing

565
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,400
out as they need to on your inkberg

566
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,080
controller two questions what brands are

567
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,519
you using i think a lot of audience

568
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,199
would want to know that i get the

569
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,200
question all the time what dehumidifiers

570
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,840
are good what humidifiers are good so

571
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,840
what brands are you using and then also

572
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,119
are you aiming for different humidities

573
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,639
throughout the different stages of

574
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:12,798
growth some people do that yeah so uh

575
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,720
i have a little um

576
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,720
like a clone tent

577
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,640
that's like two by four

578
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,079
and uh

579
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,559
the clones start there i have a

580
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,720
humidifier in there um

581
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:26,558
you know that's just like at a hundred

582
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,038
percent when i start and then i drop it

583
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,599
down to about 80. when they go into veg

584
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,279
it's around it's around 80

585
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:36,000
uh the humidity

586
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:39,359
and then when i'm in flower i drop it

587
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,359
down to about 65

588
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,640
and that's kind of been

589
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,519
you know my my sweet spot

590
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,520
uh

591
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,240
and that's just kind of it just kind of

592
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,240
stays there at that 65 range

593
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,240
and uh yeah

594
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,558
and now this is just

595
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,720
like this tent this tent setup now

596
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:59,918
whenever we're talking about greenhouse

597
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,000
or

598
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,640
outdoor or anything like that yeah

599
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,640
there's not much you can do but with

600
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,400
with something like that you're not

601
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,480
trying to fight

602
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,559
the environment you just got to kind of

603
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,798
work with what you have so

604
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,720
if it's really really hot

605
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,079
you know turn up the humidity so that

606
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,038
bpd

607
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:22,240
uh you know gets in that that sweet spot

608
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,079
uh

609
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,038
i've been saying vpd a lot i know we're

610
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:29,038
probably going to talk about it uh

611
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:30,798
but i might as we we can you know yeah

612
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,879
let's talk about it get into it so talk

613
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,639
to us about vpd directly related to

614
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,159
temperature and humidity

615
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,400
first of all i do have a lot of

616
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,400
beginners watching this so can you

617
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,720
explain what is vpd

618
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,759
and do you aim to keep your environment

619
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,400
within that optimal vpd range yeah so

620
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:50,079
vpd is vapor pressure deficit and

621
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,440
basically it's the difference between

622
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,119
the moisture

623
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,279
in the air and the moisture of the

624
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,319
leaves and

625
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,879
the

626
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,119
the closer you are to that sweet vpd

627
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,679
range that you would see on a

628
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:06,399
on a vpd chart

629
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,600
the better the plants are at transpiring

630
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,519
and that breathing and taking up co2 and

631
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,719
being able to release that humidity at

632
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:18,000
night and whenever your vpd's off

633
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,960
then uh you know your stomatas

634
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,960
that breathe in the co2 and take it up

635
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,960
like stay kind of closed and it's hard

636
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,000
for them to breathe it in

637
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,919
and it causes a lot of different issues

638
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,200
and so the closer you are to keeping

639
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,038
that bpd in the sweet range

640
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,679
the better the plants are at you know

641
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:40,960
uptaking nutrients uptake uh

642
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:44,080
breathing and and exhaling and producing

643
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,000
oxygen and sugars and so that vpd is is

644
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,399
really important i focus a lot more on

645
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,079
that in greenhouse settings

646
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,960
uh and in big indoors that have hps's

647
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,278
um

648
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,880
with leds i'm still

649
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:58,798
you know

650
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,080
it's not the same

651
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:03,918
as hps's because

652
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:06,240
if i'm running the rooms really hot i'd

653
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,640
have to make the vpd in in the 90s

654
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,519
sometimes the humidity i mean and that

655
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,720
kind of doesn't make sense to do so with

656
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,798
leds

657
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,558
uh it's a little different

658
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,158
um

659
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:20,720
and the reason the reason it's different

660
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,480
with leds in the heat it's like if

661
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,400
you're thinking about like

662
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,839
let's say it's cold outside but the sun

663
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,000
is still out you know that sun is still

664
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,240
blasting heat and if it hits your skin

665
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,159
you still feel it burn your skin and

666
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,359
that's kind of the same way with with

667
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,640
plants

668
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:40,240
so even if the ambient temperature is

669
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,080
is low

670
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,038
and that sun is out those leaves are

671
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:47,519
still getting hot and so with leds we

672
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:49,200
try to get that same feeling you know so

673
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,720
we want them to have that same feeling

674
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,000
so that's why we run the rooms really

675
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,240
hot and

676
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,599
the leaves get really hot and they think

677
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,359
that the sun is hitting them

678
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:02,079
and

679
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:05,119
and yeah and so all that

680
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:08,000
all all those are connected so

681
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:10,158
uh you know the best thing to do is to

682
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,278
have everything balanced i actually do

683
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:16,480
chase after vpd myself and uh i live in

684
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,519
a very dry climate so i'm always adding

685
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,839
humidity i don't even have a

686
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,639
dehumidifier so i have a humidifier i

687
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:25,199
use the volt smart humidifier i actually

688
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,880
have like three of them top fill it's a

689
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,480
smart one where it hooks up to your

690
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,240
phone so you get alerts when the

691
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,159
humidifier is out when it needs to be

692
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,400
cleaned so on and so forth so i love

693
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,880
that humidifier first off but i'm always

694
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,120
adding in humidity as long as i'm adding

695
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,480
in humidity staying within that vpd

696
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,278
range it really becomes somewhat easy to

697
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,120
do

698
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:47,759
now i know different climates the

699
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:50,399
difficulty level is going to vary

700
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,839
but uh for me i kind of get lucked out a

701
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,519
little bit be living in the climate i

702
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,599
live in now because adding in the

703
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,359
humidity i'm able to have a high temp as

704
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,359
well because i'm in i'm in the desert

705
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:01,839
it's hot here so all i really need to do

706
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:04,000
is just add in some cooling increase the

707
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:06,639
humidity and it usually falls in with

708
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,038
that vpd range so yeah vpd is super

709
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,720
important something i personally chase

710
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,919
after i know a lot of people chase after

711
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,558
it and uh just to clarify when you look

712
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,559
at those vpd charts there is a dark

713
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,079
green section which is the optimal range

714
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:22,158
there's a light green section and then

715
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,918
there's what the yellow section or some

716
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,760
of the charts that's like red to where

717
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,840
it's really out of range it's not

718
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:29,599
optimal at all it's the plant's

719
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,158
struggling at that point so if you're in

720
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:33,678
that light green range you're still okay

721
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,520
you know now a lot of people aim to be

722
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,559
in that optimal range which is very

723
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:38,319
narrow

724
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:40,960
but uh your plant will still be okay

725
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:43,119
it'll still grow so i know a lot of

726
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,880
people panic that they're not in that

727
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,879
dark green range it's like wait take a

728
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,000
step back it's okay

729
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,200
you're gonna be all right even when

730
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,200
you're in that light green range so i

731
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,440
figured i'd mention that one yeah see i

732
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,360
get ocd about things and like i want

733
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,080
them to be like perfect i want those

734
00:26:55,359 --> 00:27:01,038
numbers that i'm looking for to be there

735
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:03,119
you know and it's like i'll keep going

736
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:06,640
until until i figure i'll add stuff and

737
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:08,639
take stuff away until it becomes closest

738
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,840
that i can get it you know and i won't

739
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,559
be happy until until it is you know

740
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:17,038
um but yeah it's it's uh

741
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,960
it's super important uh

742
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:21,519
in plant health and honestly like i

743
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,840
think if your vpd's off completely the

744
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:25,599
whole time i mean

745
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,519
well first of all it'll never be as good

746
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:28,639
as it can be

747
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,519
you know

748
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,520
and it's hard to

749
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,440
it's hard to it's hard to grow like that

750
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:38,480
and think like that

751
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,240
you know when you know it can be better

752
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,679
and just not do something about it like

753
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,599
there's

754
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,880
you know there's no way there's some

755
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:47,278
people out there that just want to get a

756
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,360
harvest you know and so like they maybe

757
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,038
they don't have money for humidifier

758
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:53,038
they don't have money for a dehumidifier

759
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,200
so they just roll with the punches as

760
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:58,558
best they can you know but the overall

761
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,038
final quality might not be as good as if

762
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:03,278
you were in the vpd range good example

763
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:04,879
is me living in a very dry climate i've

764
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:06,079
gone through growth where the humidity's

765
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,200
been 20

766
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:08,960
30

767
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,519
which is way out of the rain it's way

768
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,278
too low and when you have a

769
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,278
when it's very dry like that it

770
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:17,839
increases transpiration in the plant so

771
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,440
like you know in the high heat it's more

772
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:21,439
prone to foxtelling as well so i've just

773
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,798
had like very

774
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,720
airy buds fox telly buds from running of

775
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,079
low humidity and i found when i do

776
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,798
increase that humidity and stay within

777
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,879
the vpd range bud quality is more dense

778
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:35,759
better bag appeal during late flower you

779
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,600
can drop the temps bring out some colors

780
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,759
so on and so forth so

781
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:41,759
yeah there's definitely um you know we

782
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,278
can continue to talk about vpd on and on

783
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,440
the importance of it but

784
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:48,319
it does stand true staying within those

785
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,480
that vpd range you do get better quality

786
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:51,678
and higher biomass

787
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,519
100

788
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,919
100

789
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,000
it's it's it's very it's very important

790
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,080
for sure because if your plants aren't

791
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,640
transpiring properly you're just going

792
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:04,000
to get some random issues and you're not

793
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,320
going to know

794
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,398
you know you can't really do much about

795
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:10,398
it unless you fix you know the

796
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:12,959
environment

797
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:15,119
and so yeah i mean that's it you got

798
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,159
lucky because it's way easier to add

799
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:20,319
humidity than it is to take out humidity

800
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:24,320
and so so that's a lot that's a lot

801
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:26,639
nicer i use like an ideal air humidifier

802
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,558
which are insanely expensive

803
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,278
you know for what they are i mean

804
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:34,240
yeah they're great but but 300 400

805
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:36,480
dollars for you know humidifier is

806
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,960
wow it's kind of crazy but

807
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,839
and the way i have it connected is i

808
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:45,038
have a stealth ro system

809
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:47,678
one that's like about 150 gallons i

810
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:51,278
think uh per hour

811
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,240
or per day actually 150 per day

812
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:53,278
uh

813
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,038
and that's

814
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:57,038
that's hooked up and it splits off into

815
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:59,839
my ro so it's constantly filling up my

816
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:02,319
ro and then it's also hooked into all my

817
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:05,119
humidifiers and it's constantly filling

818
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:07,519
those up and all the humidifiers have uh

819
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:10,239
float valves and so they just shut off

820
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:13,038
when they get full and i never have to

821
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,240
you know pour water into humidifiers

822
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:17,759
which

823
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,599
you know is a game changer as well

824
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,839
because uh yeah if you if you have low

825
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:23,678
humidity you're just gonna be you know

826
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:25,119
just filling up

827
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,360
water all the time

828
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:29,599
and so that's one thing that

829
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:32,240
i mean you can hook up just a water hose

830
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:34,319
to it pretty much a water line

831
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,000
and it'll clean the water and fill

832
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:37,519
everything up at the same time i have to

833
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,919
look into that yeah i'm filling up my

834
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:41,839
humidifier once a day i think it's like

835
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,600
a gallon and a half capacity so it's

836
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,599
larger than most of the humidifiers on

837
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:46,639
the market but yeah if i could put a

838
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,719
float valve in there and have it

839
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,159
automatically fill that'd be great so

840
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,600
i'll have to look into that one it'll

841
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,679
save you so much time and then if you

842
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,759
forget to put water in there you know

843
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,240
we're humans we forget no matter what

844
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:00,798
you know so anytime you can put

845
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,319
a machine in there doing something

846
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:05,038
there's just

847
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,798
one less thing to worry about right

848
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:10,079
so let's move on to

849
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:12,319
co2 i have some experience with co2 i've

850
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,879
tried things such as the tmp natural

851
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:17,119
canisters which can get very expensive

852
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,399
currently i'm doing the mushroom bags

853
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:22,000
the co2

854
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:24,000
365 exhale bags those ones are you know

855
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
better value i guess you could say for

856
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,679
uh for implementing co2 in there i

857
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,798
haven't yet run the tanks and stuff and

858
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,038
i know you have a lot more experience

859
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:32,558
when it comes to co2 so i've got to ask

860
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:34,720
what do you typically aim for when it

861
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:36,558
comes to co2 and how do you control the

862
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,600
co2

863
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:39,759
so

864
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:43,119
i use a uh

865
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:45,119
a tank like a normal or like a 50 pound

866
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:48,000
tank

867
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:49,359
and i have a titan regulator on it

868
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,240
and

869
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:55,199
i have a you know the tube going into

870
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,599
the tent where there's a fan

871
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,558
and i have that regulator and so i have

872
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:02,079
the sensor i put on the other end of the

873
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,398
uh

874
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,558
of the tent on the on the bottom

875
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:08,319
and then i have the i have it coming in

876
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,839
from the top and i have the air

877
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:12,158
circulating

878
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:14,639
uh forward and then it goes back around

879
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:17,679
and comes back up like that and my goal

880
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,320
is to get that co2 to go and come back

881
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,919
and go on up underneath the plants where

882
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:24,720
they can breathe under under their

883
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,960
leaves in the with their stomatas and so

884
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,880
uh

885
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,200
that sensor in that regulator i mean it

886
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,679
just does it all and so like during veg

887
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,640
i'll aim it around i keep it around like

888
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,559
like my

889
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,960
my lights actually like when i'm at like

890
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:42,398
900 ppfs and veg

891
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:46,159
my co2 is usually around 900 also when i

892
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:49,038
go up to 1200 uh with my ppfs my co2 i

893
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,640
bring that up to 1200.

894
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:52,079
that's that's kind of how i've been

895
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,120
doing it

896
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:54,879
um

897
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:57,678
you know with in

898
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,960
with co2 you know naturally in the air

899
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,240
there's about

900
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,558
you know

901
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,640
350 to 400 pps uh ppms of uh

902
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,839
co2 in the air

903
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,759
we breathe out about

904
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:15,519
900 and so

905
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:17,919
running it in at 1200 is like

906
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,599
it's like giving them you know it's what

907
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,679
they breathe in so

908
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:23,599
they just they they take it all in and

909
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,360
they just

910
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,278
it's like a superpower it's like giving

911
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:30,319
them it's like mario eating a mushroom

912
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:32,240
or something you know it's like

913
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,398
it's like they just love it they just

914
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,200
love it i can't do anything without co2

915
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:40,798
now so my life really right now is just

916
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,399
filling up co2 every week

917
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:45,119
it's just uh

918
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:48,158
going back and forth to the growth store

919
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:50,639
with tanks of co2 yeah the plants grow

920
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,320
so much more rapidly with co2 i mean

921
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,799
there are studies out there one in

922
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:56,480
particular which i heard from dr bruce

923
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:57,918
bugbee from utah state university

924
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,000
actually attended his

925
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,240
certificate program that he has one of

926
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,079
the studies he had mentioned is that

927
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,000
1400 ppm of co2 led to a 30 increase in

928
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:09,358
biomass now of course all the other

929
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,358
parameter you know all the other

930
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:12,960
variables like temperature humidity all

931
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:15,759
that stuff has to be dialed in nutrition

932
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,918
and so on and so forth but 30 increase

933
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,280
in biomass that's massive

934
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:23,838
massive just from adding co2 in so yeah

935
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,399
a lot of people really rely on co2 yeah

936
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:28,398
30 increase it's it's it's actually it's

937
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,000
crazy man like and

938
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:31,279
i never used to do it back in the day

939
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,480
obviously

940
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,599
um and i used to veg for four weeks you

941
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,918
know four week veg was kind of my norm

942
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,359
now it's like two weeks and it's already

943
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,398
too much

944
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:45,039
you know

945
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:47,199
i mean they just grow so much faster

946
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,398
so much stronger

947
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,199
um

948
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,559
it's it's it's vital it's so important

949
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,559
you know it's just as important as

950
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,960
having a good light well but the thing

951
00:34:54,559 --> 00:35:00,239
is with co2 now once you once you raise

952
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,079
your you know co2 levels you have to

953
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,838
raise everything else so that everything

954
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,720
stays balanced and you keep that same

955
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:08,960
ratio your ppfs need to go up um your

956
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:13,838
humidity and temperatures need to go up

957
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:15,358
you're you're feeding i feed at 3.0 ec

958
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:16,960
um

959
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:18,239
when i'm do when i'm using salt when i'm

960
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,679
using athena

961
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:24,239
and uh and they just take it like i mean

962
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:25,598
3.0 you see i mean that's

963
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,519
that's crazy if you would have came up

964
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,480
to me you know years ago and said you

965
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:33,199
know

966
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,199
maybe feeding you know 1500 ppms and

967
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:38,319
i do that from clone like from clone

968
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,199
they're getting fed 3.0 ec

969
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:45,119
and they're being pushed and pushed

970
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:48,159
and that co2 just lets them just take it

971
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,000
in and produce so much sugars

972
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,319
that's awesome yeah the result you can

973
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,880
get off that is just is crazy to me i'm

974
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,400
trying to add co2 right now in the

975
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,079
greenhouse

976
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,880
but the thing with the greenhouse is we

977
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,359
have uh an open roof greenhouse it's

978
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,119
it's a light depth and everything

979
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:08,639
um

980
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:11,358
uh automated it's it's great but

981
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:13,920
if i could raise the co2 levels it'll

982
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:16,078
just it'll be a game changer and i know

983
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,039
it's crazy because you know

984
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,119
it's open air and co2 will just leave

985
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:22,960
and you know you're crazy and

986
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,320
don't even try

987
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,679
but

988
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,838
you know i could

989
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:29,759
run which is what i'm about to start

990
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:32,320
doing is running uh

991
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,119
like a rain bird tube that has holes in

992
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,519
it

993
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,119
and running the co2 just through the

994
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:39,440
plants

995
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,960
and then i have like uh

996
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:45,119
like a de-stratifying those fans that

997
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,838
lift the air up and bring it back down

998
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,519
in like this motion

999
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:51,599
um

1000
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:53,759
and i'm gonna add misters because we

1001
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,760
also have low low humidity most of the

1002
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,760
time so i have misters at the top i'll

1003
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,280
have co2

1004
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,920
here

1005
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,400
you know and then co2 weighs more than

1006
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,480
oxygen so the co2 will sink while the

1007
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,160
oxygen goes out

1008
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,159
and i'm just going to see if that works

1009
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,920
or not you know what i mean

1010
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:14,000
i have to you don't have to always take

1011
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,639
people's words all the time the best

1012
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,760
thing i think to do is to to try it

1013
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:20,799
yourself

1014
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,280
and and fail and that's how you learn

1015
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,480
you know i've i've failed

1016
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,320
so many times and that's why i know the

1017
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,358
things that i know i know what to look

1018
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,160
for

1019
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:33,838
because i've seen it before from failing

1020
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:36,000
and

1021
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:37,920
and so we'll see what we'll see how it

1022
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,679
works hopefully that

1023
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,358
hopefully those misters kind of that

1024
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:44,000
water kind of keeps

1025
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:45,440
you know the co2 kind of

1026
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,880
low

1027
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,519
um

1028
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,000
hopefully i'm not just wasting co2 but

1029
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:54,079
the only way to do it is to just try and

1030
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,039
see what it does you know yeah it sounds

1031
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,960
fun gotta have fun with it right and uh

1032
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,279
you don't know unless you try like you

1033
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,599
said and i'm interested to see what you

1034
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,480
get for a result on that one but uh

1035
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,559
adding co2 in you could do that but if

1036
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,240
you don't have proper air circulation

1037
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:11,920
that's what we're going to get into next

1038
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:14,559
then your plant's not fully utilizing

1039
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,559
that co2 so getting into air circulation

1040
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:19,199
indoors how many fans do you typically

1041
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:20,559
run in your indoor environment what type

1042
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:23,679
of fans and where are the fans

1043
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:25,358
positioned okay so

1044
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:27,039
this is always

1045
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:28,000
always kind of different

1046
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,320
right

1047
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,159
so a lot of facilities

1048
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,800
you know will have like uh let's say if

1049
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:37,440
it's a 50 light facility and they have

1050
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,800
like a 20 ton ac unit

1051
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,119
um

1052
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,119
and it's and it's uh then the return air

1053
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,599
is is coming in this way wherever the

1054
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,960
return air is coming in is where i want

1055
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,480
to put

1056
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,800
the the

1057
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,719
the intakes so the intakes will be at

1058
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,680
the top always

1059
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:57,919
and the returns will be at the bottom

1060
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:59,919
so that

1061
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,000
you know the air it goes forward and

1062
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,200
then comes back so i'll place the fans

1063
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,039
to where it's it's pushing air in that

1064
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:08,879
direction and then have fans on the

1065
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:11,119
bottom fans at the top

1066
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,320
i don't put fans on the side

1067
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,079
uh

1068
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,320
because i just like i said i just try to

1069
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,599
keep it going like that

1070
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,800
uh

1071
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,960
exhausts

1072
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,839
will take the hot air out

1073
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,639
um

1074
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:27,199
and returns will keep the cool air

1075
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:30,078
coming down

1076
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:31,838
uh yeah air circulation is huge you

1077
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,240
don't want to overdo it

1078
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:37,519
you know so the best thing to do is to

1079
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:40,000
have a like a measuring tool i don't do

1080
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:41,759
anything without measuring tools

1081
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,679
you know so like

1082
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,599
if you say it's too windy

1083
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:48,399
what's the speed you know what i mean

1084
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,760
like what what is the speed is it

1085
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,639
you know

1086
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,520
one foot per second five feet per second

1087
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:56,078
like

1088
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:58,320
three to five is usually what i go for

1089
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,200
because you want the you want the leaves

1090
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,200
to

1091
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:02,239
just wave instead of the whole plant

1092
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,879
just

1093
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:06,959
you know going in the wind

1094
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,880
i think a lot of people overdo it a lot

1095
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,119
of facilities i go to they kind of they

1096
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:15,039
put those rotating fans

1097
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:18,160
and i do not like those rotating fans

1098
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:20,400
um especially on the sides

1099
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,879
when you have airflow going like this

1100
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,000
and then you have fans on this side

1101
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,880
and it's just overkill

1102
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,280
um

1103
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,599
you don't want stagnant air of course

1104
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,920
but the only way to really tell is to

1105
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,480
get a wind like a wind meter

1106
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,240
and just check every spot and if there's

1107
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,760
a spot that's not getting any air that's

1108
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:41,439
where i'll put an extra fan and i'll

1109
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,640
just put one of those hurricane fans

1110
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,400
that are you know 12 inch ones

1111
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:48,639
um

1112
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,838
i use all kinds of fans my favorite ones

1113
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:53,519
are the the d stratifier

1114
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:54,639
fans the ones that you know that have

1115
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,679
the

1116
00:40:54,639 --> 00:41:00,239
uh the bowl at the top that suck in

1117
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:02,879
aaron and bring it back down

1118
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:07,439
uh i think those are great i use those

1119
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,480
in indoor and in greenhouse

1120
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,200
um

1121
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,679
but yeah it's air circulation is huge i

1122
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:15,838
mean you want to mimic what's going on

1123
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,838
outside you know you want you there's a

1124
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:18,799
wind but you want like a cool breeze you

1125
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:20,559
don't want

1126
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,400
a tornado

1127
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,400
you know

1128
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,720
you don't want to get wind burn

1129
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,039
by blowing you know too much air on your

1130
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:29,039
plants

1131
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,880
and yeah

1132
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,639
three to five feet per second

1133
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,559
yeah wind burn is a thing and you can

1134
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:39,118
definitely do some damage to your plants

1135
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:40,960
and and stunt the growth of your plants

1136
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,720
i actually have one of those 12-inch

1137
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,720
hurricanes that you mentioned and when i

1138
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:47,358
was growing in an open room the bedroom

1139
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:50,159
i have a i think it's like a nine by

1140
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:52,559
12 room you know i was doing open room i

1141
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:54,318
had that i was utilizing that and

1142
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,078
actually had that in a grow temp before

1143
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:57,679
and it's a little bit of an overkill

1144
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,079
when it comes to the grow tent now when

1145
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:02,239
i'm in my grow tents i actually have the

1146
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,880
ac infinity clip-on fans so those are

1147
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:06,318
finally released thankfully i run one up

1148
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,640
top and then run on the one on the

1149
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:10,239
bottom as well so i've got air flow

1150
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,719
underneath the plants like through the

1151
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,639
bottom parts and then one above the

1152
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:16,719
plants and it's just a small sway right

1153
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:17,838
there they're pl the plants are dancing

1154
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:19,679
a little bit

1155
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:21,440
and then um and then ventilation i've

1156
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:22,799
got the we talk about air exchange

1157
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,720
that's kind of what we're talking about

1158
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,000
we're going to get into next at the ac

1159
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:30,318
infiniti cloud line t6 and that's all

1160
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,838
automated so when uh you know i have it

1161
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:33,838
come on intermittently as the

1162
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:36,719
temperature reaches i usually set it to

1163
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,639
80 82 at the most fahrenheit it'll kick

1164
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:40,639
on start exhausting some of that hot air

1165
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,480
or if the humidity gets up to a certain

1166
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:45,679
set point it'll start exhausting some of

1167
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,318
that air but yeah the ac infiniti inline

1168
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:50,239
fan paired with the ac infiniti clip-on

1169
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:52,000
oscillating fans that has been working

1170
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,919
wonders for me and in just my group

1171
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,838
tents so i think i'd mention that one

1172
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,639
what do you do for air exchange you're

1173
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:00,719
using co2 are you exchanging the air at

1174
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:02,960
all or are you just not exchanging the

1175
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:06,879
air because you're adding co2 okay so

1176
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,480
i'm super weird about air exchange okay

1177
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,400
when i think of air exchange i'm

1178
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,079
thinking okay so

1179
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,920
i need some fresh air right everybody's

1180
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,839
like you know your plants need fresh air

1181
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,240
your plants need fresh air

1182
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,838
what is it about that fresh air that the

1183
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,239
plants need

1184
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:24,078
you know like what is it like

1185
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:26,639
okay we're bringing in oxygen we're

1186
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:28,318
bringing in co2

1187
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:30,318
okay so the plants

1188
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:32,719
they breathe out oxygen

1189
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:34,000
so they there's plenty of oxygen

1190
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:36,480
you know

1191
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,519
um as far as co2 if you're putting in

1192
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,400
co2 that's fresh co2

1193
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:44,318
you know they're breathing in fresh co2

1194
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,680
and in my mind i'm like why do i need

1195
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:47,358
fresh air

1196
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:49,358
when i have fresh co2 and they're

1197
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:52,559
breathing out oxygen

1198
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:56,159
you know what i mean the only thing is

1199
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:58,639
if there's mold or pathogens in the air

1200
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:01,440
that's the only thing that i could think

1201
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:05,598
of that would make me want to clean the

1202
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:09,519
air and so i have a carbon filter that

1203
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:11,200
that i put in there and that's just uh

1204
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:12,159
it's not connected to the outside it

1205
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:14,318
just

1206
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,679
circulates the air inside

1207
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,800
inside the tent

1208
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:19,039
and so it's

1209
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,318
in my mind it's constantly cleaning the

1210
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:22,880
air

1211
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:24,559
i mean i i'm hoping that that's what's

1212
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,599
happening you know because

1213
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:28,880
i don't want to lose that co2

1214
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,960
and

1215
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,480
i don't need fresh air because

1216
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,800
i mean there's

1217
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,440
fresh air man's fresh co2

1218
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,880
and there's fresh oxygen

1219
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,400
i don't know what else i would need from

1220
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,039
that fresh air so i'm kind of weird

1221
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,800
about that so with air exchanges i don't

1222
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:46,960
really

1223
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,519
i don't really try to do air exchanges

1224
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,039
unless i don't have co2

1225
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:52,719
you know so in like a greenhouse or

1226
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:54,719
something like that you'd want to put an

1227
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:56,639
air exchange so that you bring in fresh

1228
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:59,199
co2 because they actually breathe in

1229
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:00,879
that co2 and that's what's depleting and

1230
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:02,639
that's what you need to add in there

1231
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,640
when you want to bring in fresh air i

1232
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:07,759
mean that's just what i think i mean i

1233
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:09,838
could i could be completely wrong but

1234
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,119
that's just how i how i see it

1235
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:13,279
and so

1236
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,880
air circulation to me is more important

1237
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,440
than

1238
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,640
an air exchange

1239
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,519
um

1240
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:24,559
i only exchange the air by taking it out

1241
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:26,719
if it gets too hot really you know

1242
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:29,838
uh other than that

1243
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:32,399
here's some fresh co2 gotcha yeah air

1244
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:34,159
scrubbing i think is what people refer

1245
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,920
to it as when you have like the inline

1246
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:38,399
fan and the carbon filter just in the

1247
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,680
open room and you're scrubbing there or

1248
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,838
cleaning the air i think that's what you

1249
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:44,000
were talking about right yeah okay so we

1250
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:45,519
covered quite a bit when it comes to

1251
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,519
environment

1252
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:49,759
one other thing i wanted to ask you is

1253
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:52,960
logging or tracking the environment's

1254
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,480
conditions are you doing any of that

1255
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,159
you know some people go old school and

1256
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,838
they're using on a piece of paper while

1257
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:59,440
the people they've got it on their phone

1258
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,039
in some way are you tracking the

1259
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,318
environment's condition logging in some

1260
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:05,119
way and kind of looking back at the data

1261
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:07,358
and utilizing it all or what um i do

1262
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,280
that in the commercial facilities you

1263
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:12,000
know we have logs for for everything

1264
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,440
there and we collect that data so that

1265
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,239
you know when we do have a really great

1266
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,079
harvest and even we have a really a bad

1267
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:18,959
harvest we can always go back and look

1268
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,720
and see

1269
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,440
you know what our temps were what our

1270
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,679
humidity is and we have something to to

1271
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,400
adjust and work off of so keeping logs

1272
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:29,679
is

1273
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,680
is really great uh when it comes to to

1274
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:34,000
that now at home i don't i don't really

1275
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,358
keep any logs i just try to keep it

1276
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,358
simple and it's usually always the same

1277
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:40,719
attempt so if i were to keep a log it

1278
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:42,239
would just

1279
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,000
it would just be the same thing over and

1280
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:45,358
over

1281
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,358
um

1282
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:49,519
but yeah keeping logs is is very

1283
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:51,598
important you got to track your how much

1284
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:53,920
how much water you're using

1285
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:57,359
uh what how what's your ec levels in the

1286
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:00,159
morning uh you know what the ph is

1287
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:03,279
and you got to adjust uh you know

1288
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:05,358
obviously all that and uh

1289
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,000
and yeah keeping it keeping track i what

1290
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:10,719
i like to do is i keep track of

1291
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,800
uh like timing schedules

1292
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:14,639
so like i can always i have an excel

1293
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,240
sheet where i can always just go and see

1294
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:17,519
whatever day it is and it'll tell me

1295
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:20,078
exactly what

1296
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,199
what day and what week i'm at and what i

1297
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,400
need to do

1298
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:24,960
you know if

1299
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,039
you know what ipms are there

1300
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,079
uh if i need to defoliate or anything

1301
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:30,800
like that

1302
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:32,960
and i'll add uh i'll add stuff that i

1303
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,119
that i do

1304
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,599
that's different instead of just logging

1305
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:40,318
in environment when it's at you know at

1306
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:43,680
home so you know if i change feeding or

1307
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:45,440
if i change ec levels or if i'm flushing

1308
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:46,399
or stuff like that like i'll put a note

1309
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,920
on there

1310
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,318
so that on my next run i can see

1311
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,800
oh around this time i did this you know

1312
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:56,960
did i do i need to do that again or you

1313
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,440
know

1314
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,199
so yeah keeping logs is

1315
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,880
it helps you out you know so it's

1316
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:04,558
beneficial to you

1317
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,280
it's not the funnest thing in the world

1318
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,200
but

1319
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,640
it's not the worst thing either for the

1320
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:10,799
environment's conditions i use the

1321
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:13,440
sensor push monitor like you mentioned

1322
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,359
you use in the beginning of this episode

1323
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,358
and uh i have the bluetooth monitor and

1324
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:19,679
i also have the wi-fi gateway so i'm

1325
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:20,719
able to actually see it wi-fi wherever

1326
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:23,759
you know i'm able to look at the

1327
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:25,358
temperature humidity and also vpd

1328
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,280
so i can actually look back at this

1329
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:30,480
historical data already you can see past

1330
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,440
hour the past day the past week the past

1331
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,440
year

1332
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,200
so uh that's the way i kind of have

1333
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,599
things logged is just through my phone

1334
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:39,118
just through that app love that app love

1335
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,760
the sensor push can't talk about it

1336
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:44,160
enough i've been using it for

1337
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,480
five six years now and uh it hasn't

1338
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:47,519
failed me so i have sensor pushes

1339
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,440
everywhere

1340
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:51,759
i have sent your pushes in greenhouses

1341
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,200
in every corner and and drying

1342
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,400
containers and

1343
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:56,318
and

1344
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,880
you know bedrooms and

1345
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:01,039
literally everywhere and one just in my

1346
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:04,640
house just so i know what's going on

1347
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:06,558
with my own environment

1348
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:07,920
and yeah the historical data and you can

1349
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,319
go back and see

1350
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,720
a lot of times a lot of times people

1351
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:14,558
miss what goes on at night

1352
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:16,558
that's just as important as what's going

1353
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,040
on during the day

1354
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:20,800
a lot of people don't really

1355
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,800
care especially if if their plants are

1356
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,039
doing okay

1357
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,519
a lot of people won't go back and and

1358
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:28,639
look and see what happened at night you

1359
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:31,119
know

1360
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:33,920
and a lot of times you know

1361
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:36,160
if it's way too humid at night

1362
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,480
then the plants can't really transpire

1363
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:40,399
as much because it gives it that sticky

1364
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,519
feeling everything's all wet it can't

1365
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,720
really

1366
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:46,639
uh release the moisture like it wants to

1367
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:47,759
uh and things like that so it's good to

1368
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:50,159
go back

1369
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,839
and look at the the data

1370
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:54,159
and see you know what's going on at

1371
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:55,920
night as well absolutely that's

1372
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:58,078
definitely a great call out so towards

1373
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,800
the end of the episode i like to ask a

1374
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,800
question specifically for beginners what

1375
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,280
advice do you have for those new to

1376
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,039
gardening that struggle to keep their

1377
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,000
environment's conditions in the ideal

1378
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:09,920
ranges

1379
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,960
a lot of research a lot of watching

1380
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:15,519
videos a lot of reading and the most

1381
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,760
important thing is measuring tools

1382
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:20,239
you gotta have measuring tools for

1383
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,000
everything or else you don't we're not

1384
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:24,879
we're not sensors you know we can't i

1385
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,719
don't have ecs built into my eyes

1386
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,800
you know i can't just look at something

1387
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:31,519
and tell you what it is we're not we're

1388
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,960
not made like that and so we have you

1389
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:35,519
have to have sensors you have to have

1390
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,400
measuring tools that's the best way to

1391
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:38,159
start

1392
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,559
because once you and then you can start

1393
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:43,199
reading watching videos getting those

1394
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:45,519
parameters and then

1395
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:48,239
adding adding things

1396
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:50,480
to to get you to that parameter

1397
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:53,039
um

1398
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,719
now i i don't know any like the specific

1399
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:57,279
problems but obviously you know if it's

1400
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:59,039
if it's hot you want to add ac and you

1401
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,400
know stuff like that and

1402
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:02,960
uh

1403
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,358
but if you have a measuring tool and you

1404
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:08,079
know what's going on it's much easier to

1405
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:08,880
fix than if you're just guessing you

1406
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,240
know

1407
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,920
like some people will be like oh it's

1408
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:13,838
too hot in here i'll come and check it

1409
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,680
and be like it needs to be even hotter

1410
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:16,880
and they think i'm crazy

1411
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:19,039
um

1412
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,079
or if it's too windy how windy is it

1413
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:21,039
show me

1414
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,800
you know

1415
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:25,599
or oh the lights are really bright well

1416
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,880
what's the ppf's you know

1417
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:29,599
um

1418
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:32,400
and so measuring tools for a beginner

1419
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:34,240
are as just as important as you know

1420
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,519
an expert or someone who's been doing it

1421
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:36,959
a long time

1422
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:39,440
measuring tools

1423
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,519
and research i don't ever stop

1424
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,639
researching i don't ever stop reading

1425
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:46,960
i'm always trying to find

1426
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:49,358
new ways of doing things in creative

1427
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,519
weird ways and

1428
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:53,598
if somebody hasn't done it that doesn't

1429
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:55,119
mean i'm not going to

1430
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,359
uh

1431
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:59,358
i'm going to try it and let you know if

1432
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:00,799
you know if it worked or not you know

1433
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:02,400
what i mean

1434
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,280
and so yeah that's

1435
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,639
and never give up and you're not gonna

1436
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,400
it's not gonna be amazing in the

1437
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:09,279
beginning

1438
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,400
um

1439
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,319
but it can i mean if you just

1440
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,000
get everything to those parameters it

1441
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:18,318
should just do its thing you know what i

1442
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,960
mean

1443
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:22,239
but yeah i think that's my advice is

1444
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,760
a lot of people

1445
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,879
start and

1446
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,079
don't know

1447
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,519
uh

1448
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,519
you know how to read

1449
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:32,239
the measurements and stuff so i would

1450
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:34,079
say really get familiar with with

1451
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:37,679
learning the measurements

1452
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:39,599
and learning uh you know

1453
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:41,838
all the different

1454
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,800
you know names for things or you know

1455
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:47,279
what ppf is and how you measure light

1456
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,119
and how you adjust it and what dli is

1457
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,000
and all these things

1458
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:54,720
are are so important and will help no

1459
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,838
matter what well said i completely agree

1460
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:57,679
with you

1461
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:59,679
so wrapping things up how can the

1462
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:02,960
listeners find you and what do you have

1463
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:05,279
upcoming in the future my instagram uh

1464

facilities i do architectural drawings

1469
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:18,400
and

1470
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,200
things like that

1471
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:24,240
i'm designing a grow out in cali right

1472
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:25,759
now a dispensary out in louisiana that's

1473
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:28,719
coming up

1474
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:31,839
and then i have some here and then i'm

1475
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:33,679
at native provisions okay

1476
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:35,519
and on instagram as well native

1477
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:36,879
provisions is the pharma map it's a

1478
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:38,318
hundred acres

1479
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,640
we're doing

1480
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:43,039
all kinds of things you know we have a

1481
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:45,679
greenhouse outdoor aquaponics where

1482
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:47,199
we're raising fish you know and

1483
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:48,639
and that's a whole nother thing right

1484
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:49,919
there

1485
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:50,879
um

1486
