1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,759
a new study done on the drying process

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,200
reveals that the 6060 method actually

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,320
results in less Tarpin compared to a

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,599
different drying method the 6060 method

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,080
for those of you that don't know is

6
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:16,920
simply drying in a space that is 60° F

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,399
in a relative humidity of 60% drying in

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,920
these conditions result in the plants

9
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,879
not drying too fast and also not drying

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,118
too slow the final product has enough

11
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,919
moisture in it so it's not too dry and

12
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:30,000
harsh when consumed the 6060 method is

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,000
widely spoken about across the community

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,640
it's deemed as the best conditions to

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,439
dry in and these conditions are also

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,679
used in many commercial facilities as

17
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:40,718
well but what is the science behind the

18
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:43,238
660 method if any and what does this new

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,600
study reveal hey everybody welcome back

20
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:47,280
to my channel for those of you that

21
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,000
don't know me my name is Chris aka Mr

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,800
Grow and you're tuned in to my garden

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,960
talk Channel got a juicy one for you

24
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,119
today this one is going to raise some

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,120
eyebrows this one is going to cause some

26
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,759
people to feel anger this one is also

27
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,000
going to cause people actually change

28
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,799
the way they go about the drying process

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
process let's start with the science of

30
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,518
the 6060 method back when I first heard

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,359
about drying in those specific

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,960
conditions I did a deep dive to try to

33
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,879
find studies to back its legitimacy and

34
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:13,438
there wasn't any studies available at

35
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:15,879
all in fact still L this day I don't

36
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,758
think there are any studies on the 6060

37
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:20,000
dry method if I'm mistaken please post a

38
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,439
link down in the comment section below

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'd love to read it but as of this

40
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:26,239
recording in late 2023 there are no

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,319
studies on the 6060 method although

42
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,118
there isn't any science behind the 6060

43
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,919
method that doesn't mean that it doesn't

44
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,280
work well I personally used the 6060 dry

45
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,439
method for several harvests for the past

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,000
5 plus years and the final product was

47
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,078
great so I'm certainly not saying that

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,040
it is a bad way to go about it by any

49
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:45,199
means but finding out that a study has

50
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,600
been done on the 6060 method comparing

51
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,240
it to a different drying method and that

52
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,640
different drying method showed better

53
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:53,519
results had to share it the title says

54
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,799
Vapor troll technology is proven to

55
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,920
retain higher turpine levels the VAP

56
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,439
Patrol technology is in the canol cool

57
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,960
cure some of you have seen the videos

58
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,959
that I've made made on that system in

59
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,038
the past it goes on to say independent

60
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,158
research conducted by the CRC in

61
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:10,360
cooperation with the hemp mine canol

62
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:13,480
samples were held at 60° F dry bulb and

63
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:17,800
a 54° f dupoint Legacy samples were held

64
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:19,518
at 60° F dry bulb and 60% RH using

65
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,439
traditional HVAC equipment with

66
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:23,239
dehumidifiers in order to combat

67
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,598
negative side effects from mishandling

68
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,640
at a testic facility samples were

69
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,000
extracted immediately after post Harvest

70
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,159
treatment additionally water content was

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,598
measured to correct for water dilution

72
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,280
by the way I'll have a link to the study

73
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,959
down in the YouTube description section

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,840
below it also shows this chart that

75
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,280
breaks it down by different tpin and

76
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:46,080
shows the total Tarpin the samples held

77
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,318
in the krol at 68° F 54 dupoint had 16%

78
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,280
higher tpin than the samples strive with

79
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,318
the 6060 method that's actually all that

80
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,000
they show on this page right now I'd

81
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,039
like to see more information on this

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,680
study such as how long were the samples

83
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:59,878
dried for I have to assume that more

84
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,280
details will come out on this eventually

85
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:03,000
and that this is just the initial

86
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,560
announcement taking a deeper look into

87
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,199
the CRC who conducted the research I see

88
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,439
some credible people here Dr James F Dr

89
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:13,919
Alison Justice Ashley Manning who's the

90
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:16,079
COO Dr mayab Shields Dr Marcus rogin

91
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,479
Selena LeBlanc and Michael alen are

92
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,319
listed as the leaders and I'm very sorry

93
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,798
if I pronounced any of those names wrong

94
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:28,079
I do a fantastic job at butchering names

95
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:30,879
bake yes sir my name is

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,920
Blake so does this new information now

97
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,639
deem the 6060 method Pro science Pro

98
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,399
science after learning about this

99
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:39,238
information will you be changing your

100
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,000
drying conditions let me know down in

101
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,840
the comment section below before we end

102
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,519
