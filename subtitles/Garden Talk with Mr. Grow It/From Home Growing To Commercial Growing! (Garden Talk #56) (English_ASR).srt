00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,160
coming up on garden talk

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,399
stable businesses they're looking for

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,638
people with actual experience and

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,559
education at a collegiate level

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,039
obviously you have full control it's

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:15,279
done by yourself you can kind of make

7
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,599
your your standard operating procedures

8
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,239
to match your time schedule and what

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,880
you're doing when you have you know 20

10
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:25,038
30 50 lights in a room it makes a big

11
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,679
difference compared to two lights in a

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,840
homegrown wet trimmed product looks

13
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,678
really great for photography so if you

14
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:33,600
like to take pictures of it to show off

15
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,519
for your instagram what trimming's kind

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,439
of a fun way to go in horticulture

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,960
there's usually more than one way to get

18
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,119
to your end product there's a lot of

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,200
different methodologies to grow your end

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,038
product and just because you're good at

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,559
doing it one way or near homegrown does

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,120
not mean you can come into someone

23
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:52,000
else's horticulture facility and change

24

102
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,040
years now you were on my twitch live

103

and we had a really great conversation

105
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,959
about a bunch of different topics and i

106
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,280
think it'd be good to have you on here

107
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,959
garden talk so we can speak specifically

108
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,039
about gardening you know one of your one

109
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,239
of your specialties for sure yep so what

110
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:06,560
i want to get into on this episode is

111
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,158
home growing to commercial growing

112
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,479
so there are so many people out there

113
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,158
that are home growers right now that

114
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,238
their dream is to eventually work on a

115
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,159
commercial facility right so you know

116
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,079
whether they live in a legal state and

117
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,519
there are already facilities open and

118
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,639
they want to get their foot in the door

119
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,720
there or maybe they're in a non-legal

120
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,000
state that's going to turn to be legal

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,840
and they want to be all prepared and

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,680
ready to go for when it does become

123
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,439
legal so they can get into the industry

124
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,519
on that avenue and you've done that

125
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,040
you've gone from home growing to

126
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,959
commercial growing so i thought you'd be

127
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,319
a great person to have on this show

128
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,680
today for the record you were the one

129
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,918
that came up with the

130
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,280
topic for this one so props to you for

131
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,918
that one

132
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:48,000
thanks yeah i uh you know some of my

133
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,319
background i started off more or less as

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,439
a home grower i won multiple cups home

135
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,079
growing

136
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:56,560
and uh you know i really

137
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,959
care and try to try to stay with the

138
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,959
home growing community as as it relates

139
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:04,560
to obviously many different plants and

140
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:06,079
gardening but particularly hemp so i i

141
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,240
did a lot of that for many years and

142
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,918
then i've also managed facilities i've

143
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,600
managed uh you know both facilities and

144
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:16,319
i've helped consult for different

145
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,320
facilities and my next project actually

146
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,199
is a large hemp grow in tennessee that

147
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,439
is all complete indoor facility

148
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,520
managed commercial projects as well as

149
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,800
homegrown projects at a very high level

150
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,478
and i think i think it would be a good

151
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,720
topic we could get into and talk about

152
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,800
some of the differences between how you

153
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,800
would manage a home growing how you

154
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,280
would either be an employee and or

155
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,918
manage a commercial grow and what things

156
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,119
you need to look for in that so

157
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,198
that's going to be good it's going to be

158
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,560
really good before we get too deep into

159
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,240
it though you gave us a little bit of an

160
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,000
introduction can you do a full-blown

161
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,759
introduction there's a lot of things to

162
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,959
be said of course for sure but tell us a

163
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,560
little bit about yourself and kind of

164
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,959
how you got into gardening

165
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,319
yes i uh well i got into gardening when

166
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,560

home growing with intents and closets

181
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,199
and various things along those lines so

182
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,080
from there i progressed into helping

183
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,199
manage growth stores and horticulture

184
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,879
stores so i've sold a lot of

185
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,120
horticulture equipment made a lot of

186
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,199
deals and and contacts with various

187
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,079
different horticulture companies

188
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,759
and

189
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,800
progressed from there to actually

190
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,800
managing a horticulture facilities

191
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,319
incredible so living the dream live in a

192
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,319
lot of people's dreams which is uh

193
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,759
working in that commercial environment

194
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,598
so what

195
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,360
you know kind of taking a step back and

196
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,279
and talking about qualifications right

197
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,639
not anybody can just walk in off the

198
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:06,399
street and apply to some of these places

199
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,560
you have to have qualifications right in

200
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:11,359
order to begin so what qualifications

201
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,120
should folks have before applying to a

202
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,280
commercial facility

203
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,120
well it honestly all depends on what

204
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,799
you're trying to get into some of the

205
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,439
entry level positions you really don't

206
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,520
need a whole lot of of qualifications if

207
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,360
you just want to be a basic trimmer for

208
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,240
instance a lot of times they will hire

209
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,720
you on with absolutely zero experience

210
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,560
because it's kind of tedious work and

211
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,599
it's entry level to get you in the

212
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,918
business

213
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,079
um other entry level positions might be

214
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,680
like a basic garden helper where you're

215
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,519
just going through and plucking leaves

216
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,120
and doing that sort of thing you know

217
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,000
you're not usually in charge of any

218
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,680
watering or in charge of too much as far

219
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,918
as you know the irrigation or

220
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,598
fertigation of your crops and some of

221
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,918
those again you can get in with just

222
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,240
basic cultivation knowledge basic plant

223
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:57,918
knowledge a good work history in other

224
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,360
fields obviously no matter what you're

225
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,198
getting hired for someone's going to

226
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,598
want to make sure you show up to work on

227
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,199
time you're credible you get along with

228
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,279
your employees you know all those things

229
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,478
that are that are general amongst any

230
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,318
job field

231
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,478
and that's more or less how you get into

232
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,800
it a lot for the entry-level positions

233
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,959
it doesn't have as much to do with

234
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,960
having a ton of experience it has to do

235
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,638
with being a good employee that they're

236
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,079
able to train to do the function they

237
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,840
need

238
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,000
now as you get up from there there's

239
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,159
also a lot of mid-level jobs you know

240
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,439
like specialty horticulture jobs like a

241
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,278
propagator or a room supervisor and some

242
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,200
other things like that those type of

243
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,559
jobs usually you want to have some a

244
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,479
little more advanced knowledge of

245
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,158
horticulture

246
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,240
you're also going to want usually one or

247
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:43,599
two years experience either as a mid or

248
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,440
entry level

249
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,959
employee already in these type of

250
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,640
facilities so that way they know you

251
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,518
have some experience in what you're

252
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,600
doing

253
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,200
and once you get to that point it's

254
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,120
important that you at least have some

255
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,480
employee management experience too if

256
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,000
you're managing a room and have

257
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,920
employees underneath you they want to

258
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,600
make sure you're you're a good fit to

259
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,319
deal with other employees so a lot of

260
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,639
that is more hr related and a lot less

261
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,240
horticulture related stuff but you got

262
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:09,360
to have those skills in order to

263
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,000
progress

264
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,000
into higher level positions within these

265
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,039
horticultural facilities

266
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,720
um

267
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,039
progressing up from that you can get

268
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,278
jobs like lead cultivator and you know

269
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,039
lead grower master grower it goes by

270
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:24,720
various different names depending on the

271
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,480
facility but a lot of times in those

272
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,480
they really do ask that you have five

273
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,120
plus years experience within a

274
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,120
horticulture facility you also by this

275
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,320
point should have some secondary school

276
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,560
or college experience in horticulture

277
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,879
agriculture or botany somewhere within a

278
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,759
related field so they know you're also

279
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:46,159
classically trained with science on how

280
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,679
plants work and that's that's usually

281
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,559
pretty important by the time you get to

282
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:52,000
that uh that higher end of things and

283
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,919
obviously you're going to need multiple

284
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,360
years of employee management at that

285
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,838
point you know because you're going to

286
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,080
have teams underneath you not only just

287
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,640
employees but also supervisors and you

288
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,720
need to take care of your entire team so

289
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,799
again once you the higher you go up in

290
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,360
these ranks um employee management

291
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,359
becomes very important as well as

292
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,159
obviously as a lead cultivator you need

293
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,560
both

294
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:17,199
advanced to expert level experience and

295
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,679
knowledge in horticulture itself

296
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,360
so that's what that is and then the the

297
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,958
last kind of section i got here is

298
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,519
support jobs a lot of the larger

299
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,599
cultivation facilities don't only have

300
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,839
cultivation based jobs there's also a

301
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,680
front desk slash intake clerks a lot of

302
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,440
times that help you know take the phone

303
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,599
calls for the facilities take in the

304
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,920
orders that that the cultivator orders

305
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,040
in for supplies and you know various

306
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,120
different things like that there's

307
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,120
commercial sales managers which are

308
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,278
another more high-end job where they're

309
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,879
actually in charge of selling the

310
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,439
products that your clothes business

311
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,838
relationships and obviously there's also

312
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,000
data specialists sometimes there's uh

313
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,760
like in the medical field there's metric

314
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,559
system in many different states that's

315
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,159
required and you need a data track of

316
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,559
everything and they usually work very

317
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,559
close along with the commercial

318
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,479
cultivator in order to make sure

319
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,879
everything stays on track and everything

320
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,839
is up to regulation based on the state

321
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,078
you're in

322
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,399
so and those jobs can vary on what you

323
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,239
need to get into those positions a lot

324
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,159
of times you know front desk clerk you

325
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,360
usually need other front desk experience

326
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,039
and that sort of thing if you're going

327
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,879
to be a data specialist i kind of want

00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,319
working for different sales because it's

335
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,439
a higher end position that usually pays

336
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,440
well so

337
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,320
that's that's kind of the four different

338
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,640
facility your entry level mid-level your

339
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,519
lead jobs you know production managers

340
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,639
and such and then your support

341
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,320
so

342
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,240
so lots of different areas that you can

343
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,839
kind of get into i think generally

344
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,240
speaking a lot of folks think that

345
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,399
master grower is kind of the end goal

346
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,759
and running a facility you know kind of

347
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,480
on the floor dealing with the plants

348
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,559
directly is one of the main options i

349
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,000
think a lot of people go for but yeah

350
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,359
definitely starting out from the bottom

351
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,839
and kind of working way up into one of

352
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,959
those positions is certainly a

353
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,320
possibility but i feel like going right

354
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,479
into one of those

355
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,480
high level positions that you mentioned

356
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,159
having an education you know they're

357
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,079
going to look for that right they want

358
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,319
you to have some sort of either

359
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:25,120
bachelor's degree or doctorate degree or

360
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,839
something um that relates specifically

361
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,519
to

362
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,399
cultivation yes and i don't mean to

363
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,159
interrupt but yes you are 100 right and

364
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,799
that's mainly the change in the job

365
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,958
market over the last 10 years as a lot

366
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,919
of states have gotten medical programs

367
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:42,559
and become more open to growing medical

368
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,958
plants they've they used to take on

369
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:47,199
cultivators from say the black market

370
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,439
that just knew what they were doing as

371
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,120
things progress more into

372
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,200
more into

373
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,440
stable businesses they're looking for

374
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,759
people with actual experience and

375
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,120
education at a collegiate level

376
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:03,120
that makes sense i remember back in 2016

377
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,159
when this state just went wreck we're in

378
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,360
nevada you were in there as well and

379
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:08,958
they just started bringing on

380
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,959
dispensaries right dispensaries just

381
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,958
launched in 2016 and cultivation

382
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,559
facilities were just opening up and i

383
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,000
applied back then because that's

384
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,679
something i wanted to do

385
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,679
and then it was so i couldn't even get a

386
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,278
response back it was like it was like

387
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,599
the market was flooded and what i was

388
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:25,600
told by insiders is that you have to

389
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,920
know somebody in order to really get

390
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,000
your your resume pushed up to the people

391
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,679
who are doing the the hiring aspect of

392
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,839
it and it can be difficult to find those

393
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,599
people you know so i you know i ended up

394
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,279
eventually giving up and just

395
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,278
just continuing on my home growing and

396
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,759
doing the media side of things but

397
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,919
how would you recommend folks actually

398
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,759
go about applying to these commercial

399
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,000
facilities so they don't run into these

400
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,919
dead ends well like you said it's it's a

401
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,839
or like we were briefly talking about

402
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,000
it's kind of a different setup now than

403
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,760
it was five to ten years ago five to ten

404
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
years ago you very much had to know

405
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,639
someone have the end get get your name

406
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,399
in someone's ear nowadays it's run a lot

407
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,000
more like most corporate businesses a

408
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,958
lot of times you can fill out online

409
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,039
applications for different positions

410
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,799
if you can't find an easy way to apply

411
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,639
for a facility that's near you and you

412
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,240
know what's there you know go look at

413
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,959
their website go look at their social

414
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,360
medias and ask them how you can how you

415
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,359
can apply for these positions try to be

416
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,320
outgoing with the fact that you do want

417
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,320
to work for them

418
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,278
yeah and like i said sometimes sometimes

419
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,839
it can be hard to find these particular

420
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:34,240
places so you might have to directly go

421
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,560
out and search you know for for their

422
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,480
direct websites they're not always on

423
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,799
indeed or some of these bigger job

424
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,039
engines now sometimes they are again

425
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:46,000
this is a larger commercial operations

426
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:48,639
nowadays and they do very much many of

427
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,559
them post indeed so it all depends on

428
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,278
the facility you're looking looking

429
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,278
towards it depends on on how they're

430
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,278
doing their hiring but a lot of times

431
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:59,919
nowadays this day and age you can find

432
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:01,519
online applications or or websites

433
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,679
linking to these different horticulture

434
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,278
companies that you can then apply for

435
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,359
okay that makes sense

436
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,360
let's get into the home growing versus

437
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,120
commercial growing side of things and i

438
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,759
want to go through some of the

439
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,000
individual processes or different stages

440
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,159
of growth and kind of what home growing

441
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
entails versus what being in a

442
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,240
commercial facility entails you know

443
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,399
let's be honest here home growing is

444
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,720
small side of things some of those

445
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,720
processes that are done just aren't able

446
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,360
to be scaled up to

447
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,199
a large amount of plants right so i

448
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,120
think there's some some big differences

449
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,799
throughout growing from from home to

450
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,560
commercial growing and you've worked in

451
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,719
the facilities before so you can

452
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:43,439
definitely give us some insight on the

453
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,879
differences so let's start with you know

454
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,399
starting from the beginning propagation

455
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,559
and seedlings

456
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,559
what differences would you say would

457
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,000
take place between home growing and

458
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,679
commercial growing when it comes to

459
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,039
propagation seedlings we can get into

460
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,039
that first of all we'll start on the

461
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,360
home growing side obviously you have

462
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,519
full control it's done by yourself you

463
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,320
can kind of make your your standard

464
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,879
operating procedures to match your time

465
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,560
schedule and what you're doing um also

466
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:11,120
like you said it's you have a lot more

467
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,239
availability to pop seeds on a lower

468
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,000
level when you're working on a

469
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,720
commercial system you want the

470
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,879
consistency of having consistent crops

471
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,199
and and consistent output of your

472
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,838
product and by popping seeds and having

473
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:27,039
different variables that may in the end

474
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:30,480
cost your company money so or cost your

475
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,838
company in less revenue you know it's

476
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,320
kind of looked at the same in the

477
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,240
economic world if you're not maximizing

478
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,639
your revenue you're losing money when

479
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,278
you look at it from an economics point

480
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,360
so a lot of times in facilities you have

481
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,919
much less variables which means much

482
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,199
less seed popping also when it gets to

483
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:48,559
cloning

484
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:50,078
sometimes you use slightly different

485
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:51,518
equipment because let's face it if you

486
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,278
have two lights or less you're not

487
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,399
usually going to need a full tray of 50

488
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,720
clones

489
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,039
so a lot of times as a home grower i'd

490
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,680
get inch and a half pre-wrapped rockwool

491
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:04,798
blocks break off what i need and clone 6

492
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,639
or 10 or 12 plants at a time whereas in

493
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,318
a commercial facility chances are you're

494
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,240
going to need hundreds if not thousands

495
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,318
of plants for your next cycle so

496
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,959
everything's done on rockwool sheets in

497
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,879
the 10 20 tray for the most part or you

498
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,519
know it's it's done a lot more

499
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,480
consistently over a larger scale it's

500
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:24,558
not made to match your size it's made to

501
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,439
it's made to match what you need going

502
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:29,200
next in the production line so again a

503
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,200
lot of times i'll use like inch and a

504
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,759
half or two inch you know 50 cell rock

505
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,919
wall sheets in a 10 20 tray as compared

506
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,640
to the individual wrapped cubes because

507
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,720
then i can just clone in groups of 50

508
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,679
and when i need a thousand clones i

509
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,360
might clone you know 1050 clones and

510
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,840
then take the best thousand and run

511
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,479
those for my next run as compared to at

512
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:53,119
a home grow if i need 12 clones i'm not

513
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,120
going to use a rockwool sheet i'm going

514
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,759
to just take those individual clones and

515
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,918
take what i need so some of the actual

516
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,400
procedure can slightly change and some

517
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,280
of the equipment can slightly change but

518
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,880
then on top of that also propagation in

519
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,200
a facility is usually done in a

520
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,039
propagation room or in the mother room

521
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,319
and you're able to maintain higher

522
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:13,440
humidities throughout the entire

523
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,678
environment

524
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,840
a lot of times in home grows people just

525
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,440
don't invest in their propagation area

526
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,439
the same they would in their flower

527
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,679
areas so it's usually you know an extra

528
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,759
closet space or i got an extra light

529
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,440
over here in the corner of my room and i

530
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:28,960
you got to spray your clones a lot more

531
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,640
to keep the humidity up on them if

532
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,720
you're in a dry area and that sort of

533
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,120
thing whereas in a facility your

534
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,120
humidity is on point because you bought

535
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:38,798
it so it's you know there's a little

536
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,959
less of the spraying of the clones a

537
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,558
little more consistent procedure let's

538
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,960
get deeper into the environment because

539
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:48,399
you mentioned that you know temperature

540
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,679
relative humidity co2 airflow air

541
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,280
exchange

542
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,120
all of the things all those things are

543
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,720
going to be somewhat similar but there's

544
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,479
a lot of differences in how they're

545
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,400
controlled from

546
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,880
home growing versus commercial growing

547
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,280
for example you know a dehumidifier is

548
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,960
gonna be a lot smaller in a home grow

549
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:06,480
you know and say a bedroom for example

550
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,000
with a couple tents it's gonna be a lot

551
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,599
smaller than it would be in a commercial

552
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,240
facility where they have this

553
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,159
massive room you know so i i imagine the

554
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,919
equipment to be a lot bigger maybe

555
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,519
multiple pieces of equipment controlling

556
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,960
things can you talk just about

557
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,798
environment differences between home

558
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,960
growing and commercial growing

559
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:23,839
yeah well of course like you said

560
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,079
there's definitely going to be

561
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:28,319
inconsistencies based on the size of the

562
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,678
equipment but a lot of your parameters

563
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,599
are still going to you're going to try

564
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,200
to keep the parameters somewhat the same

565
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,279
usually when you have that larger

566
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,080
equipment and you have a better sealed

567
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:40,558
position in a facility you have less

568
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:42,079
variation in what's going on so you can

569
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,599
be more consistent both with your

570
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,399
temperatures humidities that sort of

571
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,798
thing also with home grows many many

572
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,640
times you're not running co2 i know some

573
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:53,599
of you guys are but the majority of home

574
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,679
growers aren't running excessive co2 and

575
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:58,240
they're cycling air from their room out

576
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,480
of their room or for instance with tent

577
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,960
grows you you condition the room and

578
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,480
then cycle air through the tent whereas

579
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,000
in a facility it's more about

580
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,759
conditioning your growth space and

581
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,519
making sure it's consistent throughout

582
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:10,400
the entire growth space

583
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:11,200
so

584
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,159
um

585
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,319
yeah a lot bigger equipment um usually

586
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,320
almost always co2 injected on a

587
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,720
commercial level there's i haven't been

588
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,319
in indoor facilities without co2 because

589
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,720
it is that much of a benefit to your

590
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,158
production but as a home grower a tent

591
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,159
grower it's really hard to get those

592
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,440
elevated levels and that can sometimes

593
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:34,080
lead to you needing slightly less light

594
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,880
in running slightly less or less

595
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,798
strength fertilizer lower ec fertilizer

596
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,200
because you don't have the carbon to

597
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:43,440
increase that photosynthetic rate

598
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,880
whereas in a facility with the co2 you

599
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,960
would run things a little more to the

600
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,960
max to try to get your max production

601
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,038
out of it virtual air handlers have hepa

602
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,000
filtration and things built into them so

603
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:56,079
it can help clean the air column of

604
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,720
molds and mildews and things like that

605
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:01,519
whereas a lot of homegrown acs you know

606
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,120
the dual ducted acs and window acs and

607
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,599
even small mini splits you're not going

608
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,759
to have that type of filtration in there

609
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,079
so it's it's about controlling those

610
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,359
variables on a larger scale to make sure

611
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,678
you don't have

612
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:15,839
any loss of production whereas on a

613
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,559
small scale it's about doing things that

614
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:20,240
fit around your lifestyle so you you

615
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:21,519
know sometimes have to work around work

616
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,279
schedules and things like that and that

617
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:24,879
can change when you're timing your

618
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,480
lights of the day and

619
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,320
all sorts of things so your environment

620
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,400
can be a lot more variable in a home

621
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,839
grow i find then commercial

622
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,559
because there's money riding on the

623
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,639
commercial not just your personal but

624
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,359
there's money riding for investors that

625
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,799
do not take no returns as an option

626
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,119
so

627
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:45,839
everything has to be consistent and run

628
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:48,719
to the facility's sop when it comes into

629
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,558
that also cleanliness uh can be slightly

630
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,319
differently you know there's times when

631
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:53,279
be a little lazy in my home grows you

632
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,200
know i

633
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,200
like back to propagation i might cut

634
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,600
clones with the same scissors on all

635
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,360
four of my strains in my home grow if

636
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,798
you're in a large commercial facility

637
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:04,639
and you're cutting thousands of clones

638
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:06,879
you better keep some alcohol near you to

639
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,960
keep those scissors clean you don't want

640
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,280
to be transferring any contaminant that

641
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,120
might be on one plant to a thousand

642
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:16,480
plants that can make a huge issue so

643
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,439
you know that those are the type of

644
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,159
environmental ish differences between

645
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,919
the two and uh i guess the last thing is

646
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,320
is in commercial you're not wasting

647
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,000
space on conditioning it's not like i

648
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:30,240
said with tent grows where you condition

649
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,599
a room then cycle it through no if

650
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,200
you're conditioning a room you better

651
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,199
have plants in that room that's one of

652
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,080
your biggest expenses outside of labor

653
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,600
so

654
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,158
you better better make sure you're

655
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:42,000
pushing it as best as you can definitely

656
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,000
some good call outs there so

657
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,759
significant differences when it comes to

658
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,359
homegrowing versus commercial facility

659
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:49,038
for for those reasons you mentioned i

660
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,359
can't imagine any commercial facilities

661
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,640
using those tme naturals canisters

662
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:54,959
shaking them up and putting them all

663
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,960
around

664
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:59,200
per unit would be through the roof if

665
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,440
you're using a yeast and sugar-based co2

666
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,360
release um you yeah

667
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,038
in fact there's another difference for

668
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:08,000
you too a lot of homegirls that do run

669
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,839
co2 are usually 50 pound bottles of co2

670
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,919
and that sort of thing and once you

671
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,240
scale up into a commercial facility

672
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,720
that's 5 000 square foot or bigger a lot

673
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,599
of times they switch over to

674
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,319
um liquid co2 tanks and then inject in

675
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:25,279
that way so you can have you know large

676
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:27,678
500 gallon liquid co2 tanks

677
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,599
you know or compressed co2 tanks that

678
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,440
hold a lot more and then it's piped in

679
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:32,959
through your whole facility instead of

680
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,519
being a bottle in a corner being

681
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,200
released through a regulator so there's

682
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,960
you know quite like you said quite a bit

683
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,120
of differences on equipment and both

684
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,880
their size scaling capabilities yeah i

685
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,199
was going to ask about the the co2

686
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,679
change i'm glad you got into that now

687
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,679
air flow and air exchange is also kind

688
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,440
of the important piece kind of touched

689
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,759
on that a little bit on a home grow you

690
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,320
talk about air exchange you know having

691
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,440
a tent versus grow room they have fans

692
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:59,678
of the commercial facility there are

693
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,080
fans all around the facility right and

694
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,278
the air exchange is yes another thing

695
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,599
right having

696
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:06,960
air being exhausted sometimes i believe

697
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,918
correct me if i'm wrong from multiple

698
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,640
areas not just one area being exhausted

699
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,720
from how do typically they go about

700
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,440
you know air flow and air exchange in a

701
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,278
commercial facility well a lot of times

702
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,720
air exchange is actually less than a

703
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:25,038
non-co2 home grow because you're trying

704
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,679
to maintain keeping the co2 in your

705
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:29,599
environment now uh based on some

706
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,919
regulations at least i know for a fact

707
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,918
it is in nevada you need to have a co2

708
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,919
purge just in case something breaks and

709
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,759
it gets above certain levels it'll

710
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,840
automatically pump the co2 out of your

711
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,359
room as a safety regulation that's

712
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,038
something you would never have on a home

713
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,558
grow you would just look at your monitor

714
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:46,240
when you walk in if the number's too

715
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:47,678
high turn off your co2 and get the hell

716
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,798
out you know

717
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,400
whereas in a in a facility you need to

718
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:54,240
have these regulations in place to

719
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,880
protect your employees so a lot of times

720
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,880
you have you know co2 purging units

721
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,720
which are could be a fan on a co2

722
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,559
controller where if it gets above say

723
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,960
five or ten thousand ppms whatever your

724
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:07,200
state regulation is it'll automatically

725
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,278
dump all air out of your room from

726
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,679
within two feet of the ground

727
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:13,599
and that way it'll pull all the heavier

728
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,600
co2 from the bottom of the room out and

729
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,959
everything will start to in there and

730
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,798
and maintenance your equipment to make

731
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,880
sure that doesn't happen and again with

732
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:23,200
the home grow that's that's not

733
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,039
something you would have going on and

734
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,640
then also in the commercial facility

735
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:28,720
like i said you'd have less air exchange

736
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,559
so you're not wasting your co2 for the

737
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,720
most part there are some facilities set

738
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,399
up to do a night dump where they dump

739
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,159
all the air out of their environment at

740
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,080
night replace it at night and then when

741
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,440
the lights kick back on they'll

742
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:43,599
re-release more co2 but as for co2

743
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,679
efficiency and cost efficiency that's

744
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:48,798
usually not the best way to do it in my

745
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,480
opinion i would keep it more or less not

746
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,639
dumping co2 you can get a little bit

747
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,480
more oxygen exchange just from employees

748
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,240
coming in and out the doors and then

749
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,839
maintain as much co2 in the room as

750
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,159
possible with its sealed and less

751
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,759
exchange now air flow which is the

752
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,760
second thing you had kind of brought up

753
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,679
there is also a little different in a

754
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,359
facility because when you have such big

755
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,120
rooms you need to make sure the

756
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,558
temperature in this corner of the room

757
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,798
this corner of the room the middle of

758
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:14,399
the room the front is consistent within

759
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:16,240
a degree or two otherwise you're going

760
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,278
to have very inconsistent canopies

761
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,240
growth

762
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:22,640
uh growth situations and possibly

763
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,599
chances for contamination if humidity

764
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,759
you got pockets of humidity and such so

765
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:29,439
there's again a lot bigger equipment

766
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,839
used you know there's a company called

767
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,320
shaffer that makes fans that can launch

768
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,720
air in quite a quite a distance that's

769
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,319
really useful there's other other fan

770
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,400
technologies that actually mount on the

771
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,240
ceiling and pull air up and cycle it

772
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,240
through the room and that'll really help

773
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,079
with your consistency of making evenly

774
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,278
dispersed amongst your room when you

775
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:51,439
have you know 20 30 50 lights in a room

776
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:53,278
it makes a big difference compared to

777
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,200
two lights in a homegrown okay so

778
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,960
definitely some some major differences

779
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,440
there for sure let's get into the

780
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,159
vegetative stage uh for a little bit

781
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,558
here

782
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,320
lots of things that home growers do that

783
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:06,558
really aren't done in the commercial

784
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,480
facility side of things you know maybe

785
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,480
we should start with kind of watering

786
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,679
and feeding right when you're dealing

787
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,720
with

788
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,400
hundreds

789
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,839
thousands of plants i don't think a lot

790
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,600
of commercial facilities do hand

791
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:20,398
watering right they're on some sort of

792
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:22,798
automated machine fertilizer you know a

793
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:24,558
dosatron or something like that you talk

794
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:25,759
to us about the differences between you

795
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:27,519
know

796
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:29,599
fertilizing and watering

797
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,679
yeah of course and and there is quite a

798
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,199
few different companies that uh that

799
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,960
deal with different fertigation and

800
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,880
irrigation equipment but on a home

801
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,960
growth scale it's just not worth buying

802
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,520
this equipment like like you said

803
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,679
dosatron some dosatrons can be a couple

804
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,519
thousand dollars just for us a single

805
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,519
peristalic pump and a controller you

806
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,119
know and if you have a two light home

807
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,200
grow it's not necessarily worth your

808
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:53,439
investment to throw in that much money

809
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,759
or say like an argus fertigation system

810
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,919
can cost thirty fifty thousand dollars

811
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:59,919
or more that touch screen controls for

812
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,840
all you you're not going to need that at

813
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,720
a home grow you're just never gonna get

814
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:05,038
your

815
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,519
your value back from buying a 50 piece

816
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:09,519
of equipment whereas a facility that's

817
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,119
ten thousand square foot or more they

818
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,839
can probably get their money back on

819
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:15,278
that fifty thousand uh dollar investment

820
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:17,119
so you're right a lot of times home

821
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,798
grows

822
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,398
there's a lot of hand watering majority

823
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:22,398
of the time in veg in order to get

824
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:24,079
things to size just because it's it's

825
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,398
also harder to

826
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,398
put in irrigation when you're trying to

827
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,479
cycle things on a smaller level if

828
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:32,319
you've got two plants that are young and

829
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,759
veg two plants that are old and veg

830
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,000
they're gonna be drinking completely

831
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:39,278
differently and it's almost easier to

832
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,640
hand water at that point but if you have

833
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:44,480
500 plants on these five rows and 500

834
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,960
plants on these five rows you can set up

835
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,440
fertigation equipment to feed those 500

836
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,558
how you want feed those 500 how you want

837
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:55,360
and then you end up with uh

838
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:58,319
not a more consistent but a more

839
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,918
more efficient plan of feeding both in

840
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,439
labor cost because you got to remember

841
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,520
commercial facilities one of your

842
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,038
highest costs is labor costs if you're

843
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,359
hand watering you're going to need twice

844
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,200
as many employees as if you're using

845
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:10,000
irrigation equipment

846
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,000
so

847
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,240
that that is a huge difference in the

848
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,440
vegetative section another big uh

849
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,519
difference is the amount of

850
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,038
experimentation you can do and like i

851
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,398
mentioned earlier as a home grower you

852
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,158
can pop different seeds you can run

853
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,158
different strains you can do a lot of

854
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,559
different things to excite yourself

855
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,640
about your horticulture experience when

856
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:31,038
you're in a facility you need to follow

857
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,960
the slps whatever the lead grow or

858
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,519
whatever who's that ever in charge of

859
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,120
that they set up those sops for a reason

860
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,000
they know what they're doing most of the

861
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,959
time

862
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,798
most of the time but they uh

863
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,038
on top of that they they set it up in a

864
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:46,879
way so that way it works for their

865
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:47,759
production techniques

866
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,520
and

867
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,359
when in horticulture there's usually

868
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,639
more than one way to get to your end

869
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,199
product there's a lot of different

870
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,038
methodologies to grow your end product

871
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,960
and just because you're good at doing it

872
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:00,480
one way in your home grow does not mean

873
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,798
you can come into someone else's

874
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,200
horticulture facility and change what

875
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,879
they're doing that could very much

876
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,440
change the outcome and the time

877
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,159
schedules of what they have going on and

878
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,440
that is a very big no-no so once you get

879
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,120
into uh

880
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,880
facilities again you're using larger

881
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:19,119
irrigation systems

882
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,320
consistency is a key there you want to

883
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:24,239
consistently grow well oh my camera's

884
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:28,000
getting fuzzy there it goes

885
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,599
but uh you uh consistently want to stay

886
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,679
to these schedules because you're on

887
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:33,759
very strict time schedules on when you

888
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,759
need these plants ready for their next

889
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,919
stage of growth whereas at a home grower

890
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:39,759
if you want to let it grow a week longer

891
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,759
and let your plant and flower finish a

892
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,119
week later you can kind of get away with

893
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,278
that if you try to do that in a

894
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:47,199
commercial facility that week could be

895
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:50,159
thousands of dollars worth of production

896
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,319
cost for no harvest now problem to the

897
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,278
investors and the money people that are

898
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,798
paying your salary so

899
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:59,038
that's that's kind of the difference is

900
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:01,119
in the vegetative system um your time

901
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,519
schedule is super important you're not

902
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:05,359
experimenting you're doing what's needed

903
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,240
to get these plants to the next stage

904
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:11,038
based on the slps and you're usually

905
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,720
involving irrigation systems as compared

906
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:14,640
to hand watering once you scale up the

907
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,360
larger size facilities

908
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,880
i imagine plant training which is often

909
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:20,319
done in the vegetative stage is going to

910
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,399
be a lot different too right you

911
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:24,079
mentioned labor how labor can be

912
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:26,879
significantly more when it comes to hand

913
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:28,319
watering well if you're in a cultivation

914
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,159
facility and you want people to do

915
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:33,678
defoliation or lollipopping or you know

916
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,840
low stress training or any type of these

917
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,240
these hands-on training techniques it's

918
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:40,079
going to be more labor cost so i imagine

919
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,000
that they cut back a little bit there

920
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,759
compared to what home growers are doing

921
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,519
to their plants talk to us about the

922
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:47,038
differences with plant training of

923
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,720
course and uh

924
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,398
with that respect some of that plant

925
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,159
training is still done because it's very

926
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:53,839
important a lot of defoliation and

927
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,840
lollipop is still done on a commercial

928
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:58,158
scale because you need that air flow for

929
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,079
your ipm prevention to help prevent mold

930
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,159
growth and mildew growth and things like

931
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:04,240
that so a lot of those techniques are

932
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,840
still used and that's just a labor cost

933
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,919
you know management's going to have to

934
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:09,918
endure but you're also right about the

935
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,559
fact that there's a lot less lst there's

936
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,960
a lot less topping because and this is a

937
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:17,038
regulation issue most home grows for

938
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,440
medical plants anyways are regulated to

939
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:21,359
how many plants they can grow so if you

940
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,278
need x amount of product out of your

941
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,359
medical plant but you're only allowed

942
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,759
six flowering plants

943
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:30,319
you might want a much bigger plant that

944
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:32,319
takes more topping and training and lst

945
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,480
and a much longer veg time in order to

946
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:36,798
get your desired result whereas in a

947
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,558
facility we're really trying to minimize

948
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:40,639
the amount of veg time we have and if we

949
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:42,879
need to fill more plant canopy space we

950
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,038
will add more plants in

951
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,840
and it's actually less labor cost to put

952
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:49,440
more plants per area than it is to grow

953
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:51,439
a much bigger plant i know you have

954
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,519
another episode that was that was very

955
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,360
good about why you grow smaller plants

956
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,278
from a year so i'll go on this podcast

957
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:58,639
it's one of your more popular episodes

958
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:00,240
you guys should check that one out too

959
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,640
when you're done with this one

960
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,960
but um yeah that's that's very much why

961
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,679
the the production cost and the

962
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,759
regulations on home growers lead right

963
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,000
lead home growers to grow larger plants

964
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:14,240
in most areas

965
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,319
whereas commercially we fill it with

966
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,240
more plants that are

967
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,398
in the same size root zone same

968
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,640
consistent size canopies so that way we

969
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,798
can match it to our irrigation systems

970
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,320
and all our inputs and everything grows

971
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:27,839
evenly

972
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:29,839
um

973
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,278
yeah and

974
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,439
yeah i think that's all the notes i have

975
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:35,200
on that one that's there's that's the

976
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,200
main difference is those regulation

977
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,278
differences and and the fact that home

978
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,440
growers sometimes need to grow larger

979
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:43,519
plants

980
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,278
you touched upon ipm and i want to

981
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,440
circle back around to that and get a

982
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:48,640
little bit deeper into ipm because you

983
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,558
know it's a

984
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,399
much larger scale with commercial

985
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:55,278
facilities compared to homegrown right i

986
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:57,199
mean a typical home grower is going to

987
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:59,278
oftentimes just use a small 48 ounce

988
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,038
hand sprayer and spray their plants yes

989
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:02,960
you know with that or use a chappin a 2

990
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:05,278
gallon chap or something like that yep

991
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,798
and i have some of those myself

992
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:08,239
yeah when you're on the commercial

993
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:11,519
facility side of things when you're

994
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:13,598
dealing with more plants you know 50 100

995
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,199
plants thousands of plants often see

996
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,679
people go to like

997
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,719
the backpack style ones which spray

998
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,039
further

999
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,638
you know more of a mist compared to some

1000
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,239
of these hand sprayers can you talk to

1001
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,800
us about the differences with you know

1002
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,959
ipm and spraying and all that stuff yeah

1003
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,560
and like you said you briefly touched on

1004
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,639
it as with everything else your

1005
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:35,039
equipment scales up with the size you're

1006
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,039
growing in fact even if you look at a

1007
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,119
horticulture perspective from say large

1008
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:40,719
scale greenhouses production greenhouses

1009
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,879
for cut flowers and things like that

1010
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,878
they have giant booms that go through

1011
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:49,358
their whole greenhouse and and can

1012
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:51,440
fertigate and or spray pesticides just

1013
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,838
just to cover that much area without

1014
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,480
needing the labor costs involved and at

1015
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,599
small to mid scale commercial facilities

1016
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,519
like you said a lot of times you're

1017
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,280
using a five gallon backpack sprayer

1018
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:03,199
because otherwise if you're mixing up a

1019
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,519
gallon half gallon at a time you're

1020
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:08,159
going to be mixing all day and trying to

1021
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:10,960
spray as compared to getting your work

1022
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:13,440
done and continuing on to the next path

1023
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,280
uh the other thing i need to

1024
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,240
mention with that is as a home grower

1025
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,240
you're not limited in what you can use

1026
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,479
as long as you're growing safely you're

1027
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:23,919
using things that are not carcinogenic

1028
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,358
you're using things that have low

1029
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,200
toxicity and a low half-life so it can

1030
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,960
break down quickly you're pretty much

1031
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:33,439
open to use whatever you want on your

1032
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,679
home garden now the regulations for

1033
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,920
facilities are twofold there are

1034
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:39,679
agriculture regulations for pest

1035
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,440
management and pest application in

1036
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:44,078
almost every state and federally that

1037
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,000
you have to follow so a lot of your ipm

1038
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,599
specialists inside your facilities will

1039
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,519
actually need

1040
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,920
to be regulated by the state and they'll

1041
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:54,880
actually have to take classes and be

1042
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,440
certified in order to apply pesticides

1043
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,000
on top of that within the medical plant

1044
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,320
market there's also

1045
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,400
direct regulations by those states that

1046
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,720
have legalized the medical plan so

1047
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,880
almost every legal state has their own

1048
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:10,959
set of regulations on which pesticides

1049
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,240
you can use which pesticides you cannot

1050
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:17,440
use you know for instance there's a

1051
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:20,239
strong it's fairly toxic pesticide for

1052
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,400
killing water molds called metal axle in

1053
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:26,639
almost every medical state you cannot

1054
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:29,200
use that product in nevada you can so it

1055
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:30,879
has a long half-life it's toxic but it's

1056
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:32,879
not carcinogenic

1057
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,200
nevada you can other states you can't

1058
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,880
and as long as you use it based on what

1059
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,679
the label says so that way you're

1060
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,119
following the federal regulations

1061
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,118
then you can

1062
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,880
use it in a facility in nevada you use

1063
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,320
that same product on a facility in

1064
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,320
california

1065
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,800
so you got to know your state by state

1066
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,519
regulations as well as your federal

1067
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,359
regulations on who can apply pesticides

1068
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:57,440
and what type of certifications they

1069
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:59,119
need before they are allowed to do that

1070
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,639
legal so i gotta have a lot of knowledge

1071
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,559
in regards to that because i'm sure it

1072
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:05,519
gets pretty muddy going from state to

1073
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:06,960
state the impact it can be astronomical

1074
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:09,838
right if you're spraying the wrong thing

1075
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,358
on there you send that crop over testing

1076
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:12,960
all of a sudden it fails tests and your

1077
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:14,880
entire crop is wiped out and you can't

1078
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,199
put that product on the shelf

1079
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,320
yes and then you're gonna have some very

1080
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:22,559
mad investors very very mad investors a

1081
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,320
lot of times you if you lose more than

1082
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:26,000
two percent of your crop throughout the

1083
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,920
year your investors are not going to be

1084
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,400
too happy if you break the five percent

1085
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,000
mark failure rate like

1086
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,639
you they're probably looking for a

1087
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,119
different cultivator so there's a lot of

1088
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:38,639
line for sure flowering stage let's get

1089
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,480
into the differences between home

1090
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:43,118
growing and commercial growing within

1091
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,000
the flower stage yeah uh briefly this

1092
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,838
one is is kind of kind of repetitive of

1093
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,760
some of the other things again you you

1094
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:51,279
need to make as a home grower you make a

1095
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,960
cultivation plan that works for your

1096
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,560
schedule a lot of other times you have a

1097
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,720
job you have other things going on in

1098
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:58,799
your life you have a family you need to

1099
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:01,039
maintain that schedule

1100
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,800
a large facility on the other hand might

1101
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,279
just run two or three shifts of

1102
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,200
employees and it's not about oh the

1103
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,280
lights have to be on now because i can

1104
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:10,879
work on it it's we set up the lights

1105
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,680
based on what's most efficient for our

1106
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,000
facility and the employees work around

1107
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:18,239
that schedule so it's a little backwards

1108
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,239
to those regards

1109
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:22,319
also in a homegrow a lot of times you

1110
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,399
can run your plants as long as you need

1111
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,599
to get them to finish to cena since the

1112
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,079
way you want in a cultivation facility

1113
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,480
timing is everything if you are running

1114
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,160
a nine-week flower room when it's day 63

1115
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,079
you are harvesting whether that plant

1116
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:37,838
needs two or three more days or not

1117
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,680
that's just the way it is because within

1118
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:41,920
a day or two you have veg plants that

1119
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:43,679
have to be in that location and if you

1120
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,680
over veg your veg plants now they're

1121
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:48,159
sitting longer in veg and that's a waste

1122
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:50,719
of resources and money spent

1123
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:53,358
in the previous cycle so again timing is

1124
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:55,838
everything commercially whereas you can

1125
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:57,920
kind of work things around a little bit

1126
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,039
to your liking into your schedule as a

1127
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,358
home grower

1128
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:04,239
and then uh secondly um

1129
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:06,159
consistency consistency consistency

1130
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:07,759
follow the standard operating procedures

1131
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:10,078
the lead growers are put there for a

1132
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,440
reason they have again like i said

1133
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,000
earlier if

1134
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,159
the you need to follow the procedure

1135
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,719
they have to grow there's many different

1136
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:20,480
ways to grow a healthy plant they have a

1137
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:22,719
setup plan they were put in there for a

1138
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,119
reason so if you're a mid to entry level

1139
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:27,199
employee just follow what they're saying

1140
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,119
even if you have a different idea on how

1141
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:30,799
to do it bring that up in a question

1142
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,680
form to the lead grower bring that up

1143
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,839
later but do the work they tell you to

1144
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:38,000
at that time even if it's inconsistent

1145
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,320
with your own knowledge yeah there's so

1146
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,320
much on the line for sure throughout the

1147
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,800
the entire grow really you know it makes

1148
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,359
me wonder you had mentioned being on a

1149
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,000
set schedule and how they're harvesting

1150
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:51,759
flowers even when they might not they

1151
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,320
might need a little bit more time right

1152
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,880
so i imagine how many facilities are

1153
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,760
harvesting early to where like it's a

1154
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,358
potency isn't at its full potential and

1155
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,359
potentially you know clear trichomes for

1156
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:05,279
example where it's you know the effect

1157
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:06,880
doesn't last as long or it's a you know

1158
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,599
different effect and what the that

1159
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,960
cultivar truly brings out and to work

1160
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,760
around that a lot of times the

1161
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,838
facilities work plants that match their

1162
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,480
facility if you have a plant that needs

1163
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:20,480
10 weeks to flower and it seems to grow

1164
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,480
in someone else's facility great but in

1165
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,000
your facility seems a little bit slowed

1166
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,000
down and you have a nine week or eight

1167
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,239
week flower schedule you're cutting that

1168
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,480
plant out of the lineup after one run of

1169
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:32,479
it and switching to something that grows

1170
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,079
properly in your environment whereas a

1171
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,760
home grower like i said you might just

1172
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,160
give it the extra week because you like

1173
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,480
that effect you like that plant you're

1174
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:42,559
not doing that on a commercial level

1175
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,559
it's about making sure those ends meet

1176
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:46,559
for your investors

1177
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:48,639
so you have to make those tough

1178
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:50,719
decisions that are a little bit tougher

1179
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:52,639
in this regard in a cultivation facility

1180
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:54,559
than what they would be as a home grower

1181
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:56,400
now harvesting getting a little bit

1182
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,759
deeper into that you you know mentioned

1183
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,760
that they're on a strict schedule they

1184
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,680
need to do it at a certain time but how

1185
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,680
about the physical process of of

1186
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:05,118
harvesting it varies quite a bit from

1187
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:06,799
home grow to

1188
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,960
commercial facility can you speak on

1189
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,960
that a little bit yeah as as a home

1190
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,280
grower you more or less harvest and when

1191
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,720
it's the endocynosis like i said you can

1192
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,240
be growing different plants and you do

1193
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:18,838
it based on what you want we already

1194
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:21,279
kind of touched on that but

1195
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:22,880
uh um

1196
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,400
yeah you also have to match your dry

1197
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,640
space so a lot of home growers don't

1198
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,400
necessarily have dedicated dry rooms and

1199
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,318
dedicated gear rooms

1200
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,880
like what you would have in a facility

1201
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:34,880
so if your dry room is half full and

1202
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,358
these plants that you harvested a week

1203
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,960
ago still need a few more days to finish

1204
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:40,000
leave your other plant and flower a few

1205
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,318
days

1206
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,159
finish those ones trim them up then

1207
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:46,000
harvest just so you can cycle things

1208
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:47,920
through because again kind of like

1209
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,679
propagation usually your dry room and

1210
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,280
your propagation as a home grower are

1211
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:52,639
kind of your last thought you think

1212
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,880
about your flower room first your

1213
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:57,199
bedroom second everything else how can i

1214
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,200
kind of build it around in a cultivation

1215
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:01,679
facility there is rooms dedicated to

1216
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:04,000
drying on top of that as an indoor

1217
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:06,159
facility you also are going to pretty

1218
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,159
much always have humidifiers and

1219
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:10,399
dehumidifiers in that room because the

1220
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:12,318
first few days after you harvest and you

1221
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,400
have a room full of of medical plants

1222
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:16,000
it's going to release a lot of water and

1223
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,880
you're going to need a dehu to keep it

1224
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,440
down after three to five days or so the

1225
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,680
water really slows down a lot and in

1226
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,358
some situations you can end up a little

1227
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,279
too dry and you might actually need a

1228
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:29,759
humidifier in that room to keep you at

1229
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,760
that perfect consistency whereas a home

1230
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,440
grow you're more or less tailing it

1231
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,880
tailoring it around your climate when i

1232
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,760
lived in nevada i would need a

1233
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,920
humidifier if you live in florida you

1234
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,000
would need a dehumidifier but you

1235
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,639
probably won't need both you can get it

1236
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,199
close and do pretty decent um

1237
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:49,519
differences is a lot more control over

1238
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,838
what you're doing and then also in a

1239
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:53,679
facility your harvest is usually done by

1240
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:55,838
a harvest team so they're clearing a

1241
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,919
whole room at one time and filling their

1242
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:00,078
dry room whereas like i said in a home

1243
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,000
grow you kind of tailor it to based on

1244
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:04,160
how much room you have when your plants

1245
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,920
are ready and you kind of muck around

1246
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:07,279
your schedule in order to get the best

1247
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,280
product you want

1248
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,200
timing is money in a commercial facility

1249
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,079
and you cannot do that it's about having

1250
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:15,919
a team that can efficiently de-leaf and

1251
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,599
harvest these plants get them the way

1252
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,000
you can get out of cleaning that room so

1253
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,240
that way within 24 to 48 hours you have

1254
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
new plants in that room

1255
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,598
whenever i'm drying at home i always get

1256
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,119
like a little jealous i always think

1257
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,440
about like how it is a commercial

1258
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,838
facility and how much easier it probably

1259
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,159
is having a dedicated drying room with

1260
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:36,880
controls for temperature and humidity

1261
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:38,960
because i you know it it's not easy to

1262
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,400
to control that those aspects depending

1263
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,720
on you know the climate you live like

1264
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,119
you mentioned where where in nevada

1265
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:46,959
where i live it's very dry so i'm always

1266
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,680
having a humidifier and oftentimes i

1267
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,000
just dry in my grow tent and

1268
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,519
there is variation in the you know the

1269
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,559
temperature and humidity you know i

1270
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:58,480
don't really have a air conditioner at

1271
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,480
all times you know in a in my drying

1272
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,800
room or growing room to where i can get

1273
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,199
a low temperature uh for example a lot

1274
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,560
of people go after like 60 60 60 rule

1275
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:09,358
right 60

1276
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:11,358
humidity yeah 60 degree fahrenheit

1277
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:14,159
oftentimes i can't get that low as far

1278
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:16,318
as the temperature you know i'm at 65

1279
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:17,838
sometimes even 70 and you know the

1280
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:19,920
higher the temperatures get the more

1281
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:22,159
terpenes are being evaporated you're

1282
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,200
losing that so i do get jealous not

1283
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,799
being able to have a steady temperature

1284
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:28,879
humidity when drying in particular

1285
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,079
because getting down to those feel like

1286
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,318
if you have a dedicated driving room

1287
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,318
like in a cultivation facility it's much

1288
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:37,119
easier to conserve those terpenes and

1289
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:39,599
control that drying time than it is you

1290
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,200
know at home i i agree with everything

1291
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,920
you said there that is very much the

1292
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:46,399
truth trimming so at home grow you have

1293
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,400
the opportunity the wet trim of dry trim

1294
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,079
people have preferences some people like

1295
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,358
to do a wet trim some people like to do

1296
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,119
a dry trim

1297
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:55,358
often times nine times out of ten

1298
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,200
they're using hand trimmers you know so

1299
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:59,519
they're spending the time to have a nice

1300
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:01,039
manicure buds or they have you know

1301
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,199
there are small home trimmers like those

1302
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:04,800
bolt trimmers that you can use i think

1303
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:07,519
those are halfway decent but on a

1304
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,599
commercial facility some facilities from

1305
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:11,358
my understanding still do want to do the

1306
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,680
hand trimming but oftentimes they're

1307
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:16,078
doing they have large trim machines now

1308
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:17,279
which are handling pounds at a time he

1309
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,560
talks about trimming kind of the

1310
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,839
difference is homegrown versus

1311
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:21,039
cultivation

1312
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:23,279
yeah

1313
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:25,358
well you kind of went into some of the

1314
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,760
basics of it the majority of home grow

1315
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:29,519
is almost always completely hand trimmed

1316
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,599
from the larf nugs all the way up to

1317
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,199
your top buds it's as much hand trimmed

1318
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,318
as possible because people don't want to

1319
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:39,358
invest in the machines for small scale

1320
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:41,279
when you get into a facility usually

1321
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:42,960
it's either machine trim or a mix of

1322
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,119
machine and hand trim they'll take the

1323
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,358
top quality buds have those on a trim

1324
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,119
team hand trimmed and then all the mids

1325
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:51,279
that are still sellable they'll usually

1326
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,599
run through a machine and have that as a

1327
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,680
different quality of product and or

1328
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,838
sometimes mixed into the top end batch

1329
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:59,279
depending on how it looks but

1330
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,119
for the most part you're right there's a

1331
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,800
massive difference in equipment as there

1332
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:05,200
has been through every bit of this

1333
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,800
podcast so far um

1334
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,199
and when you're when you're talking

1335
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,280
about trimming also when you're trimming

1336
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:13,118
at home the majority of your smoke most

1337
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,800
of the time the majority of of the

1338
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,720
product you're making is your own

1339
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,560
personal product so you can be a little

1340
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,239
sloppy with your trimming you don't you

1341
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:22,960
can leave a crow's feet here and there

1342
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:25,759
and you know under trim some stuff if it

1343
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,440
has really sugary trim leaf on it and

1344
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,920
you're fine with that because you know

1345
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,720
it's for you anyways who cares

1346
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,480
when

1347
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:34,239
you're in a commercial facility that

1348
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,880
product is not yours that product is

1349
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,799
going to a consumer some consumers are

1350
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,480
more picky than most of you

1351
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,839
if they see a crow's feet on there

1352
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,800
they're going to be on their instagram

1353
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:47,759
complaining about your facility so you

1354
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,599
need to trim very tight very cleanly if

1355
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,560
you are a trimmer for a facility there

1356
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,400
is no

1357
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,358
leave a little bit because it's sugary

1358
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,960
it's make that look as best as possible

1359
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:58,559
so that way you have the best of bag

1360
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,400
appeal and you can leave the best

1361
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,239
impression on your consumers for your

1362
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,240
facility

1363
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,559
um also like you said what versus dry

1364
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:08,838
trimming a lot of home growers and again

1365
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:11,279
this is based on climate if if you have

1366
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:12,559
a a much

1367
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,519
drier

1368
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:17,199
area you might want to dry trim anyway

1369
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:19,679
so that way you have some sugar leaf

1370
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:22,318
protecting your product and it'll slow

1371
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:24,000
down the actual evaporation rate out of

1372
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:24,960
it and you can get a little longer dry

1373
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,199
out of it

1374
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,039
whereas if you're again in a much more

1375
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:30,318
humid area you might want to speed that

1376
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:32,558
up a little bit because you're having a

1377
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:34,318
hard time keeping your humidity below 60

1378
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,160
percent so it might be more beneficial

1379
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:38,079
for you to wet trim

1380
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:40,239
whereas in a facility where you have

1381
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,318
everything set and perfect it's almost

1382
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:45,199
always dry trimmed first of all the

1383
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:46,880
majority of machine trimming equipment

1384
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:49,519
works off of dry trimming not wet

1385
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,920
trimming so in order to use the machines

1386
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:53,599
almost always you need a dried product

1387
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,920
not always there's a few that wet trim

1388
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,559
but most of them dry trim and then on

1389
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,480
top of that it's uh it's about the

1390
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,319
evaporation of terpenes and terpene

1391
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,400
release if you have your environment

1392
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:06,079
perfect and then you can kind of seal

1393
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,559
those buds to slow down the amount of

1394
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,720
air or evaporation off of them you can

1395
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:13,200
retain a little more terpene so usually

1396
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:15,358
dry trimming is best unless like i said

1397
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:17,598
you're in a home environment to where

1398
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:19,598
wet trimming might allow you to dry at a

1399
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,160
more proper rate that's the only time i

1400
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:24,240
would recommend and on a side note wet

1401
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:26,239
trimmed product looks really great for

1402
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:27,838
photography so if you like to take

1403
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:29,759
pictures of it to show off for your

1404
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:30,880
instagram what trimming's kind of a fun

1405
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,200
way to go

1406
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,358
and then curing curing is kind of last

1407
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:37,598
piece i want to get into on this episode

1408
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:40,639
talk to us about differences of curing

1409
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:42,720
home versus commercial okay again um

1410
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:46,239
when you're curing at home a lot of

1411
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:48,558
times it's in glass jars or smaller bags

1412
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:50,239
the the chicken bags or the turkey bags

1413
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,160
at the biggest depending on the size of

1414
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:54,000
your grow and then you're more or less

1415
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,000
putting them in a closet putting them in

1416
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,239
somewhere that's dark to keep them going

1417
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,838
but a lot of times you're sitting at at

1418
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:01,759
your room temperature or whatever and

1419
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:04,880
you're just letting it finish up on its

1420
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:07,680
own again you don't just like drying you

1421
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,480
don't necessarily have a dedicated room

1422
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:10,558
for

1423
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,199
your curing stuff

1424
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:15,440
now in a facility you have to have a

1425
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:17,439
dedicated room for your curing stuff

1426
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,039
because that is a finished product that

1427
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,838
is worth money

1428
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,599
you need locks you need security you

1429
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:26,558
also need a room to be able to house it

1430
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:29,039
all also it's not usually batched in

1431
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,440
small batches like that um the majority

1432
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:33,679
of states including nevada i know you

1433
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,838
can only test a batch that's five pounds

1434
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:38,318
or smaller above five pounds you need a

1435
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:40,880
second test so a lot of the times you're

1436
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:42,880
using uh like five gallon buckets with

1437
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,280
sealable lids or

1438
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:48,079
uh they make uh larger turkey bags like

1439
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:51,119
the ostrich bags and stuff is the actual

1440
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:53,039
name of them on the liberty bags that um

1441
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,039
hold quite a bit more product and that

1442
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:57,679
way you can keep closer to like a three

1443
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:59,519
to five pound batch at a time test each

1444
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:01,440
batch individually before your product

1445
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:03,280
goes out whereas a home grower you're

1446
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,599
not worried about testing batches and

1447
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,839
regulations so you just match your

1448
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:10,318
container size to the size of your grow

1449
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:12,159
put it in a closet burp your jars every

1450
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:13,920
once in a while you're good to go in a

1451
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:16,078
larger facility like i said you're kept

1452
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,480
under lock and key and security it's

1453
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,839
also usually a little bit cooler room

1454
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,639
kind of like your dry room you're going

1455
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:24,400
to want it 60 65 degrees so that way

1456
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:26,480
everything stays with the moisture

1457
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,639
content you set it at and you're using

1458
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,199
larger containers to actually cure and

1459
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:34,318
finish that up to about a five pound

1460
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:35,519
point in most states

1461
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:37,358
yeah i was going to mention that the

1462
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:39,440
temperature control that happens during

1463
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:40,799
curing and typically in home grows i

1464
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,480
mean a lot of people don't really care

1465
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,519
about the temperature at least from my

1466
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,199
experience a lot of people don't really

1467
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:46,480
care about storing in a specific

1468
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:48,000
temperature just

1469
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,240
room temperature and if their

1470
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,480
temperature increases you know like i

1471
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,479
live in the desert i have some home grow

1472
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,039
jars right next to me right now in this

1473
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,800
room and i'm in regular air temperature

1474
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:00,639
and you know it's just personal home

1475
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,480
growth yeah so it doesn't really matter

1476
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:04,318
to a lot of folks however one thing to

1477
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,318
to keep in mind that if you're not in a

1478
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:08,480
temperature controlled if you're

1479
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:10,239
you know if you're sitting at 75 80 plus

1480
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,159
degrees you could be losing those

1481
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:13,759
terpenes right you probably are losing

1482
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:15,440
those terpenes i was gifted one of those

1483
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,240
wine fridges it's where i control the

1484
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,760
temperature it's much easier to conserve

1485
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:21,279
those terpenes when it's you know under

1486
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,119
a right temperature

1487
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,200
controlled area yes

1488
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:27,200
okay so we went over a lot here taking a

1489
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:29,279
step back and just given some general

1490
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:30,960
advice to the folks listening you know

1491
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,880
what advice do you have for those

1492
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,039
looking to make that transition from

1493
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,358
home growing to commercial growing okay

1494
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:40,318
i do i have a couple pieces of advice

1495
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:41,598
for you honestly um number one

1496
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:44,239
and

1497
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,559
this is obviously depending on on who's

1498
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:49,279
in charge of the hiring and cultivation

1499
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,880
but don't brag about your home grow

1500
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,800
that's one of the number one things you

1501
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,039
can do to kind of screw yourself out of

1502
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,519
a job if they know you have an active

1503
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:59,599
home grow going at that guaran at that

1504
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:01,519
time and you're producing a lot they

1505
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:03,838
look at that for a couple different

1506
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:06,480
negative reasons one you could possibly

1507
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:08,558
bring in pests that are can are that are

1508
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,240
specific to medical plants

1509
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,640
to that facility

1510
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:15,279
and they don't want that increased risk

1511
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:16,799
at all and that can help you hit a glass

1512
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,839
ceiling even if you are the most

1513
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,839
qualified candidate

1514
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:25,279
on top of that there's also try to work

1515
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:26,960
towards your formal education like i

1516
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,240
said it's not the same marketplace it

1517
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:32,318
was 10 years ago you really need to have

1518
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:34,639
some formal horticulture education in

1519
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:37,119
order to progress through the tiers at

1520
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:40,000
these at these facilities

1521
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:42,240
um so i i highly recommend going back to

1522
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,159
school learning what you can about

1523
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:48,719
horticulture i also highly recommend

1524
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:50,000
mentioning you have experience you you

1525
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:52,239
mentioned that you're good with

1526
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,199
horticulture you may even mention that

1527
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:57,358
you've had a home grow do not brag on

1528
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:59,679
your home grow that can be a problem and

1529
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:02,880
put you in a glass ceiling so watch out

1530
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:04,799
for for those mistakes and then also

1531
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,318
work towards your formal education so

1532
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,400
that way they know you're serious about

1533
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:10,079
horticulture in general and that can

1534
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,160
increase your chances and look good

1535
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,760
amongst the those that are looking to

1536
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:15,199
employ you lots of good information

1537
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,040
there for those looking to make that

1538
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:19,598
transition from home growing to actually

1539
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:21,358
working in a cultivation facility

1540
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:22,960
