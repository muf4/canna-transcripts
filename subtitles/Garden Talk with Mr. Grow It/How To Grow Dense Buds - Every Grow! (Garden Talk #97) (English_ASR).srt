1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
coming up on Garden talk if you let

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,580
something veg longer ultimately your

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,500
Cola will be larger but that doesn't

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,359
necessarily mean it will be denser I

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,638
think you can achieve the same density

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,759
with all the same conditions on a small

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,379
plant it's that last little five percent

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,880
on your gas pedal it's like you're

9
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:22,379
almost to the floor you've got

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,599
everything cruising down the freeway

11
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:26,399
perfectly and you just hit it and you

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,618
just sink a little bit lower and you

13
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:32,098
take off bigger the roots the bigger the

14
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:34,259
fruits so get your root Zone on point

15
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,839
that's only going to be able to bring in

16
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,460
more food and nutrients for the buds and

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,219
they will be denser because of a

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,439
healthier root system individually there

19
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,320
isn't like a silver bullet out there of

20
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,558
if I just add this nanometer it's gonna

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,558
be

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,600
foreign

23
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:57,058
what's up everybody if you that don't

24
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,500
know me my name is Chris aka Mr grout

25
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:01,198
and you're tuned into the garden Talk

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,480
podcast this episode number 97. in this

27
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,338
episode I interview Chad Westport he has

28
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,618
been gardening for 13 years and he grows

29
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:10,140
a variety of plants he is the host of

30
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:12,719
several different shows on both the FCP

31
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,299
and fcp2 channels and he's actually been

32
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,118
on the podcast once before episode 25

33
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,880
where he talks all about bricks in this

34
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:22,739
episode we get into growing dense buds

35
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,780
something that a majority of people are

36
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:26,399
looking to do but it's easier said than

37
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,259
done if you gain value from these

00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,798
of my goals for this podcast is to bring

53
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,719
free gardening information of all plants

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,460
to the general public that being said

55
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,438
I'd like to thank the sponsors of

56
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,839
today's episode who help make that goal

57
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,818
possible thanks to AC Infinity for

58
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,739
sponsoring this episode they now have

59
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,679
supplemental lighting called the ion

60
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:16,200
beam I have the ion beam S11 grow light

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,620
bars which are 11 inches long and use

62
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:22,378
Samsung lm301 H diodes but they also

63
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,080
have the ion beam s16 which are 16

64
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:26,818
inches long and use the same diodes it

65
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,739
comes with a light controller with four

66
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:30,659
light intensity levels and timer

67
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,099
settings I'll have a link in the

68
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:33,539
description section below so you can

69
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:36,000
learn more about their supplemental

70
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:38,280
lighting and the discount code Mr growed

73
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:46,500
and we're back welcome to the Garden

74
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,840
Talk podcast today I am joined with Chad

75
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,519
Westport how you doing today I'm doing

76
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,140
excellent thank you I appreciate you

77
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,140
coming on you've actually been on the

78
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,818
podcast before episode 25 and you talked

79
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:58,979
all little bricks lots of good

80
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:00,479
information on that one so if you missed

81
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,518
it you may want to listen to that

82
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,719
episode after this one in today's

83
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,360
episode we're going to talk about

84
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:08,280
growing dense buds now I know not

85
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,739
everybody listening to this episode

86
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,300
cares about bud structure I've actually

87
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,939
had a large handful of people tell me

88
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,459
they like loose Airy buds for example so

89
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:18,900
that's kind of interesting so I don't

90
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,300
want to jump to the assumption that

91
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,980
everybody wants to grow dense buds but

92
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,900
there's certainly a significant amount

93
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:27,299
of people out there who do so let's talk

94
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,800
about it but first can you introduce

95
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,599
yourself for those that didn't catch the

96
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,480
first episode we did together

97
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:36,539
yeah and thanks for having me back on

98
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:39,359
um but hi everybody uh Chad Westport I

99
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:42,719
am a long time grower with experience of

100
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,180
indoor and outdoor garden beds I've done

101
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:48,239
this commercially but my passion lies

102
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,719
with home cultivation uh whether it be

103
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,400
no nutrient rich food or just you know

104
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,340
the best medicinal plants you could

105
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,080
possibly get I'm into helping people get

106
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,299
that process started because I feel it's

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,239
very important it really is super

108
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:06,120
important so let's start with genetics

109
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,580
genetics genetics genetics that can

110
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,400
certainly impact dense buds so talk to

111
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,719
us about genetics yeah you know genetics

112
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,340
and actually I'm gonna play off

113
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,139
something that you just said here too

114
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,939
which is part of genetics but it's

115
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,500
breeders directions and breeders

116
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:22,079
intentions

117
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,060
um I come from a day where

118
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,680
you know larger was better bigger was

119
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,120
better that's that's what you wanted you

120
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,300
wanted dense and you wanted large

121
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,459
flowers that's what caught people's eyes

122
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,740
well today things are kind of changing

123
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:37,379
and there's different uses for medicinal

124
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,620
plants um some of these get turned into

125
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:43,439
concentrated forms and

126
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,319
to be honest dense flower structures

127
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,120
aren't the best uh producers when it

128
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,300
comes to getting that type of material

129
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,759
it's the open loose stuff that has

130
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,259
access to all of the trichome heads on

131
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,939
the flowers

132
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:59,340
that they're able to get instead of it

133
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:01,259
being stuck in the middle so yeah

134
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:03,599
genetics plays a big role in it and

135
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:07,259
breeders intentions are starting to

136
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,000
breed towards maybe in more open or Airy

137
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:12,060
structure

138
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,418
um you know traditionally you can think

139
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,978
of you know it's hard for me to say this

140
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:18,959
with a straight face because there's a

141
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:22,379
lot of poly hybrids today there's not

142
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:25,620
really true indicas or true sativas

143
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:28,439
anymore uh in in you know the

144
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,379
traditional sense but if we use that as

145
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:33,180
a starting point for the conversation

146
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:35,038
you're going to find that Indica plants

147
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,139
tend to be a little bit more dense

148
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,300
they're a little bit shorter whereas

149
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,038
sativa plants tend to grow a little bit

150
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,400
taller and they tend to have a little

151
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:46,860
bit more of an open structure and that

152
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,918
is just kind of their you know the

153
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,379
region of origin a lot of these sativas

154
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:55,198
are equatorial where it's a lot hotter

155
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:58,560
down there the open structure helps them

156
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,139
it's an advantage to the plant it's kind

157
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,459
of a an offensive mechanism defensive

158
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,319
mechanism I'm not sure what you would

159
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:06,418
call it there but it does it you know it

160
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,740
keeps it from overheating amongst other

161
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:10,379
things whereas some of the shorter

162
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,720
indicas uh they're from colder regions

163
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:17,399
with higher elevations they need to

164
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,699
finish faster so genetic wise indica and

165
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:23,818
sativa do kind of play a difference

166
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:25,620
in all of that and you know to to get

167
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:28,199
back to the the first part is you know

168
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:31,019
just the morphology of them some plants

169
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,520
they have conical shaped flowers others

170
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:35,399
just have golf ball shaped flowers

171
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:36,719
that's just kind of the way it is uh and

172
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,239
you're not really going to change it

173
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,100
regardless of what you do there it's

174
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,680
interesting that you mentioned Indica is

175
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,500
kind of being more dense I actually have

176
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,660
a cross called chiloto G and what I did

177
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,279
was I had a brisker OG by square one

178
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,960
genetics crossout with Pakistan Valley

179
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,659
and Pakistan Valley is a hundred percent

180
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,159
Indica land race strain and maybe that's

181
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,620
where the bud identity because every

182
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,439
single plant I grew out of this cultivar

183
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,180
has just been dense buds so it's got to

184
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,639
be coming from that Indica side of

185
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,500
things I think although the brisker that

186
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,560
also has some density as well

187
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,660
but uh but yeah pretty interesting there

188
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,879
a lot of the pakistanis the Hindu Kush

189
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,860
the Afghans a lot of those that yeah

190
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,740
higher elevation cold weather those are

191
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,840
you know dense dense flowers now are

192
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,579
there any specific breeders that come to

193
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,538
mind that have cultivars that dense up

194
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:27,300
nicely

195
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:28,800
yeah and you know know I kind of lean

196
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,220
back to maybe some of the older breeders

197
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,220
or people who are working with older

198
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:37,080
cultivars Duke diamond from Old Dominion

199
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:40,319
is one that comes to mind he worked with

200
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:43,318
a lot of the skunk flowers which is kind

201
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,479
of an older morphology it's an older

202
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,699
structure so we see that in a lot of his

203
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:50,279
work you know today there's a lot of

204
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:52,860
things that are purple there wasn't so

205
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:55,500
much purple back in the 90s or you know

206
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,020
even before that so you often see a lot

207
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:02,220
of green in those flowers

208
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:05,879
um similarly uh Top Dog seeds JJ he

209
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,500
works with sours he's a New York guy uh

210
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:11,699
and that's that's another one that just

211
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,740
tends to be pretty chunky on the vine

212
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:17,879
um

213
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:20,038
AKA AK Bean brains skunk VA these are a

214
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,139
couple of the older breeders working

215
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:24,360
with more traditional lions that yeah

216
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,918
it's it's pretty much always chunky good

217
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,319
to know yeah I know people listening in

218
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,719
they're shopping for good genetics that

219
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,399
they know dents up so I figured we could

220
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,778
to name some of those one that comes to

221
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,399
mind for me is Square One genetics

222
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:37,918
everything I've grown out from Square

223
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,860
One genetics has been dense and the

224
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:43,079
density actually runs from the top all

225
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,659
the way down to the bottom so like I've

226
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,399
had plants that I grew that I didn't do

227
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,620
lollipopping to try to get off any of

228
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,440
that larf yet those buds on the bottom

229
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,839
were dense a real dense rock hard and

230
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,300
it's the genetics that are doing that so

231
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:00,180
I love having genetics that are dense

232
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:02,039
all the way down and um yeah that square

233
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:04,799
one Gen X is definitely one of them so

234
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:06,958
let's get into different things in

235
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,278
regards to Growing the plants that are

236
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,139
going to help with blood density let's

237
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:12,899
start with lighting when it comes to Bud

238
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:15,000
density are there types of light that

239
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:17,100
help with blood density

240
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,500
um well the sun sun is obviously number

241
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,080
one let's so let's say we've got the

242
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,480
right genetics uh you know that really

243
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,519
you know the sun that's what we're

244
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:32,120
trying to duplicate but whether it's uh

245
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:35,039
like HPS uh ceramic metal halide uh led

246
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,740
the the one real Factor that's gonna

247
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:40,679
make a large difference is the intensity

248
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,519
so you know you you can do it with all

249
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:43,979
of those

250
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,860
but it's the intensity of them that I

251
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,019
think are going to make the difference

252
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:51,839
of whether it's dense or not if the

253
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:54,060
potential exists uh and that you know

254
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,560
again is intensity is just the strength

255
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:58,919
the amount of usable light that the

256
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:02,039
plant can get uh but also heat too and

257
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:05,219
that's where you know HPS or the high

258
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:07,319
intensity discharges uh were a little

259
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,740
bit different than the current model of

260
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,360
LEDs the hps's would get a lot hotter so

261
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,980
you have to run it a little bit further

262
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,740
which would get you less of that

263
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,300
intensity whereas the LEDs are a little

264
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:22,220
bit cooler you can run it a little bit

265
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:25,439
closer you get that intensity so

266
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:27,899
intensity is important LEDs easy to

267
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,360
achieve the right conditions all around

268
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:33,480
for that unless you got the sun I think

269
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,519
a good example is CFLs right you try

270
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,740
growing plants under CFLs flowering

271
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,539
there you're not going to get nearly as

272
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,480
good as density as you would with a full

273
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:43,679
spectrum LED and it comes down to a lot

274
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,259
of people say it comes down to the

275
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,719
intensity right the amount of par coming

276
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:49,799
down on the plants so yeah I'm glad you

277
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,980
mentioned that one

278
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:55,199
yeah my first two uh my two first two

279
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,778
official technically literally closet

280
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,240
grows were with CFL bulbs so it is

281
00:10:57,778 --> 00:11:01,259
possible but uh you'll notice a

282
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,459
difference when you step up your

283
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:04,679
lighting

284
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:06,659
now what about like the spectrum of

285
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:09,059
light you know some people say that blue

286
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:11,578
light could contribute to more airier

287
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:13,199
Buds versus red in the Spectrum which

288
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:14,578
more red on the Spectrum towards

289
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,860
flowering it's often said that that

290
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:19,500
helps with butt development but density

291
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,139
what are your thoughts on all that

292
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:25,139
yeah it's funny it's it's kind of like

293
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:28,259
uh the cherry picking of information you

294
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:29,699
know you mentioned red and blue and you

295
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:31,500
know if you go back five years we're

296
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,480
talking LEDs we're talking blurples

297
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,940
which is that combination of the red and

298
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,700
blue lights there are studies that

299
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:41,040
absolutely say red light and I mean it's

300
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:44,399
proven absolutely show that red light

301
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:47,338
can you know promote Bud Set uh promote

302
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,039
flowering there's also absolutely papers

303
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:52,260
that say blue light is great because it

304
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:54,240
keeps the stomata open which means it

305
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:57,600
can transpire more and it could get more

306
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,220
CO2 in there so just if you cherry pick

307
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,259
that you'd be like well all I need is a

308
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,560
red and a blue light right

309
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:06,838
no it's uh monochromatic they they have

310
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,479
run tests and they said no we can't just

311
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,220
run red we can't just run blue but if we

312
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,500
put the two together

313
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,200
that's where the whole kind of the

314
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,120
blurple lighting came from and we've

315
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,940
Advanced since then white light white

316
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,980
light captures all of the spectrums and

317
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,320
even with a white light you look at the

318
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,379
Box you look at your light uh or you

319
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,060
know HPS bulbs you'll see that chart on

320
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:31,740
the back it'll have the wave it'll have

321
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:34,439
the color spectrums

322
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,360
you'll see that you know red and blue

323
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,579
are both kind of almost equally

324
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,959
represented and everything else is a dip

325
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:44,099
so

326
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:45,778
those those can uh be a benefit to the

327
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,959
to the plants and to the growth and

328
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:51,539
denser buds but individually there isn't

329
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:55,078
like a silver bullet out there of if I

330
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:58,559
just add this nanometer it's gonna be

331
00:12:55,078 --> 00:13:02,159
I've heard that far red into IR like

332
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:04,439
above what I want to say above 730

333
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,059
nanometers I believe right when we start

334
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,220
talking about the Emerson effect having

335
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:10,619
a combination of that Spectrum along

336
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,680
with the other Spectrum if it's over

337
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:16,259
five percent plants are more prone to

338
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,179
foxtailing in flowering okay there's one

339
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:19,679
thing that I had learned and I've seen

340
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:23,338
it happen I remember back when the

341
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:25,439
electric sky ES 300 the V1 I think they

342
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:28,740
had seven percent or maybe even 10

343
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,240
percent far red IR in there and

344
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,620
unfortunately when you get towards the

345
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,019
end of flowering and you get these Fox

346
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,539
tailing Things become more airier and

347
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,919
looser so I'm not sure if you've had any

348
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:39,120
experience with that or if you've heard

349
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,519
that before

350
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,078
I'm not I've not had experience with it

351
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,578
directly but it would kind of make sense

352
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:46,620
that I'm thinking back again to the

353
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:48,299
equatorial sativas

354
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,360
um you know I just believe that there is

355
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:52,679
more of that IR in that region of the

356
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,060
world just again

357
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:55,739
uh have the sun and the angle of all

358
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:58,259
that works

359
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,360
um but yeah to your point you need very

360
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:03,000
little of it you don't need to have a

361
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,399
full board dedicated to you know

362
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,120
everything 7 30 and above

363
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,919
a little bit goes a long way absolutely

364
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,740
let's get into environment I can

365
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:15,838
certainly have an impact on bud density

366
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,459
VPD talk to us about like what is VPD

367
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,779
and how does that impact blood density

368
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:23,699
okay so VPD is kind of it's a measure of

369
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:26,600
the amount of moisture in the air versus

370
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:29,459
the potential that the air can absorb

371
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,879
it's really kind of a calculation of

372
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:35,338
humidity and temperature

373
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:37,078
having a Target VPD is something that is

374
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:38,820
going to help the plant grow and the

375
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:41,638
buds dense up because it encourages

376
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,379
transpiration transpiration is just

377
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,240
plant sweat you know we sweat through

378
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:48,320
our pores plants sweat through their

379
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:51,419
stomata when you have the right VPD

380
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,300
they're able to sweat because the

381
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:56,578
moisture the the kilopascals is the

382
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:58,198
technical measurement of it but the air

383
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:01,078
pre or the water pressure in the air is

384
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:03,359
lessened in the plant so it escapes when

385
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:06,059
it escapes it draws up water and

386
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,720
nutrients from the roots so by by kind

387
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:12,539
of manipulating your VPD and keeping the

388
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,278
plant in a you know a desired range not

389
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:16,919
a sauna but you know when you sit in a

390
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:18,659
sauna you sweat so you kind of keep the

391
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:20,939
plant in a good range where it's

392
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:23,639
actively keeping the stomata open and

393
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:26,459
drawing nutrients from the root Zone and

394
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,959
that will help build denser buds yeah

395
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,119
I've actually had experience I live in a

396
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:33,439
very dry climate natural humidity I'm

397
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:37,799
looking at it right now 26 right here

398
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:40,860
it reaches down to the the teens and

399
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:43,979
upwards of 35 percent and so I'm always

400
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:47,039
adding in humidity right into my grow

401
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:49,320
but I've certainly grown plants under

402
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:52,019
this humidity you know very low humidity

403
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,820
under 35 percent and unfortunately the

404
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:55,799
lower the humidity increases the

405
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,440
transpiration and like you mentioned

406
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:00,120
increases the uptake and actually well

407
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,579
first of all can lead to toxicity issues

408
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,679
if you have a overabundance of nutrients

409
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:08,219
in the medium but it unfortunately has

410
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:09,359
resulted in barrier buds for me now I

411
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,920
think it's just a matter of just

412
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,539
increased transpiration and Buzz just

413
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:14,219
kind of forming and flying all over the

414
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:15,958
place at a so much of a rapid rate

415
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,060
that's not able to keep its density

416
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:21,059
that's just me kind of speculating but

417
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:24,000
uh the low humidity definitely impacts

418
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:25,799
Bud production in a negative way in my

419
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,299
opinion well I shouldn't say a negative

420
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:29,219
way because again I go back to the folks

421
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:31,979
that are okay with the area buds the

422
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,980
loosier looser buds so let me just say

423
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:37,980
that uh the low humidity environments

424
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,539
can certainly contribute to non-dense

425
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,600
buds

426
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:44,578
I am in a place where if it goes below

427
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,339
50 it's it's

428
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:49,739
freezing cold winter uh sexy I'm kind of

429
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,360
in a a Lucky Zone where 60 it just kind

430
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,639
of hangs out at 60. so that really helps

431
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,199
me with my drawing another topic though

432
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,959
another topic

433
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:00,120
uh CO2 is another thing that is involved

434
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:02,879
with environment right can supplementing

435
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,740
CO2 impact the bond density at all it

436
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,900
definitely can uh there's a couple

437
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,078
things that you would want to have in

438
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,980
place for CO2 use

439
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,438
um

440
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,240
I guess I'll just touch on that first

441
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,259
um you know you want kind of a sealed

442
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,480
environment

443
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:21,539
um a lot of us exhaust the areas where

444
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,759
our Gardens are if you're just quickly

445
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:25,859
turning that out every 30 seconds to a

446
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,259
minute it might not be as beneficial as

447
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:29,879
if you slow that down or it was a sealed

448
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:32,579
environment where it kind of recycled

449
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:36,299
that there is a benefit either way

450
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:38,000
whether it's sealed or not and you also

451
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:40,139
need to have a powerful enough light

452
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,179
powerful enough light again we're going

453
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,240
back to intensity and we're going to go

454
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:48,780
back to temperature because yes CO2 can

455
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:51,359
help build denser buds it increases the

456
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:54,538
uh or it opens the stomata which you

457
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,839
know allows for more CO2 uptake which

458
00:17:54,538 --> 00:18:01,319
again transpiration more nutrients but

459
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:03,720
it also accelerates photosynthesis and

460
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:05,099
that's really the driving Factor behind

461
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,019
all of this that's why we want the

462
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:09,558
intense light it's because we want to

463
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:12,298
create photosynthesis it's going to help

464
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:15,960
cells multiply fly a little bit faster

465
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:19,319
than if you didn't have CO2 and all of

466
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,298
this is just kind of a it's that last

467
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:22,678
little five percent on your gas pedal

468
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:24,480
it's like you're almost to the floor

469
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,580
you've got everything cruising down the

470
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,620
freeway perfectly and you just hit it

471
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:30,418
and you just sink a little bit lower and

472
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:33,000
you take off what are some ways that

473
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:34,559
home Growers can supplement CO2 without

474
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,119
breaking the bank

475
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:39,899
right

476
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:43,319
um you know I am talking a lot whether

477
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,759
it be on webcast on a phone uh so

478
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:48,000
sometimes if you're in a small enough

479
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:49,319
room just ambient levels uh if you talk

480
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,359
a lot or if you like to sing to your

481
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:54,379
plants you can increase CO2 in a

482
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,579
meaningful way there there are also

483
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,260
bottles that you could get small

484
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:01,319
canisters almost like the size of a two

485
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:03,960
liter or um you know smaller that you

486
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:07,099
can use be careful with CO2 it is a

487
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:10,140
toxic deadly gas if it

488
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:12,000
accumulates uh in a large enough amount

489
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,600
it likes to sit low to a floor so if

490
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,038
you're using it definitely have monitors

491
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:19,019
but one of the most popular things or

492
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,538
common things I see amongst you know

493
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:24,000
hobby Growers is mushroom bags something

494
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:25,740
like that in their tent they just kind

495
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,679
of hang it up high kind of let it fall

496
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:31,019
down over the canopy and

497
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,460
that's that's typically the uh most

498
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:34,139
common one I see okay and then what

499
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,298
about the tanks you know you hear people

500
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,160
going to the hydro store and lugging

501
00:19:36,298 --> 00:19:40,558
tanks in another house and then put in

502
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,380
that Crow space would you recommend

503
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,839
against doing that is mushroom bags

504
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,000
better or what

505
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:50,220
um you know in a sealed environment with

506
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,140
the tanks you're able to control it

507
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,839
you're able to set kind of a Target

508
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,419
whereas with the bags you're just like

509
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:58,678
taking what you get uh it's going to you

510
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:01,919
know probably start off high and then

511
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:03,240
decrease over time a lot faster than a

512
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,980
tank where you could set it at a

513
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,700
particular level

514
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,400
um

515
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,580
you know really the size of the garden I

516
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,798
think would dictate something like that

517
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:15,960
um a lot of hobbyists

518
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:17,519
typically don't need that some people

519
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,798
who

520
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,079
um you know have have a different Garden

521
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:24,240
or you know maybe medicinal Gardens

522
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:27,418
something with a little bit more power

523
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,279
it could benefit them it's worth it if

524
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:31,259
you meet all the other conditions but

525
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,379
again if you don't have you know light

526
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:36,660
intensity you're not going to benefit

527
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,580
yourself because

528
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,660
you need to run the plants hotter the

529
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:41,819
room a little bit hotter when you're

530
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,919
running CO2 so

531
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:45,359
to summarize all those things swirling

532
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,299
in my head right now

533
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,619
good points I've used the mushroom bags

534
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:51,660
as well as the canisters in the past

535
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:55,139
both of those have worked to increase

536
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:57,298
the CO2 level in my environment but uh

537
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,759
surprisingly so I do have a CO2 monitor

538
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:01,200
in my grow at all times and uh

539
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,000
surprisingly every time I go in there

540
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,679
it's like over 800 and I'm thinking

541
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,880
about why would that be why would that

542
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,759
be and all the things that people don't

543
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,580
think about is I live in the house that

544
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:14,038
I grow in so like I'm exhaling CO2 my

545
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:17,279
girlfriend is exhaling CO2 my three cats

546
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:19,500
are exhaling CO2 and when you've got

547
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,940
that intake coming right so you're

548
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,038
exhausting the air out of the growth

549
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,080
space bringing in fresh air I'm doing it

550
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:28,019
passively and there's fresh CO2 coming

551
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:29,579
in at all times and it keeps it up 800

552
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:32,279
plus just about every time I go in there

553
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:34,918
it's 800 plus so perfect I feel like I

554
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:36,658
don't need to supplement CO2 anymore I

555
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,640
mean I've tried it it's helped and so on

556
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,380
and so forth but I'm at the point where

557
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,480
I'm such a small homegirl and he's

558
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,620
growing six to 12 plants at a time I

559
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,019
feel like I don't need to spend that

560
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:48,058
extra money on supplementation that my

561
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:48,779
air that I'm excelling is is providing

562
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:51,298
enough

563
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:54,418
yeah and you know I said I I agree

564
00:21:51,298 --> 00:21:56,639
commercially and commercially if you

565
00:21:54,419 --> 00:22:00,179
have you know a large nursery and you're

566
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,159
able to increase yield by say two grams

567
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:05,400
per plant

568
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,320
for me and you for the hobbyists not

569
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,298
really a big deal might not be worth the

570
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:13,259
cost or the expense but when you do that

571
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:15,720
on scale times 20 30 40 50 000 that adds

572
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:17,460
up real quickly so again it's kind of

573
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,940
one of those last little things that you

574
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:22,679
can toy around with and in my opinion

575
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,659
yeah yeah I completely agree Plant

576
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,220
Nutrition let's get into that that can

577
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:28,500
certainly have an impact on bud density

578
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,500
talk to us about proper Plant Nutrition

579
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,659
to ensure blood density okay well the

580
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,419
probably a good example or an easy

581
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:39,600
example of is this a real thing

582
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:43,080
go into any grow store look at any line

583
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:46,619
of nutrients that you see whether it be

584
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:48,538
organic non-organic whatever it is look

585
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:51,178
at the bottles there's always a bloom

586
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:52,440
and there's always a veg and we know

587
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:55,159
we've been trained to look at those

588
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,320
three numbers the N the P the K nitrous

589
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:59,820
nitrogen potassium phosphorus

590
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,339
um

591
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:04,079
so yes so if you look at those bottles

592
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,000
you will see that these numbers do vary

593
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,678
between the flower and the veg one of

594
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,700
the main things that you want to kind of

595
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,960
cut off when you transition is nitrogen

596
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:16,019
nitrogen can kind of promote some like

597
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,819
cell elongation it can make things

598
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:21,480
basically grow a little bit more where

599
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:24,418
we want to focus more on the bud

600
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:28,140
production not so much of stretch or

601
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:30,000
size so yes nutrients can absolutely do

602
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,679
it nitrogen being probably one of the

603
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,159
main ones one of the obvious ones

604
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,798
there's also sometime an increased

605
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:40,820
demand for potassium and flour that kind

606
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:44,400
of helps things bulk up a little bit

607
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:47,099
at the same time I've been guilty of

608
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,600
this I've seen different products in the

609
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:53,219
garden store where you know it's like

610
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:54,779
zero nitrogen like 50p 50k and I'm like

611
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,579
well that's gonna knock it out of the

612
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:59,099
park right

613
00:23:56,579 --> 00:24:00,899
balance balance is so important when it

614
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:02,158
comes to any nutrient program so you

615
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,100
don't want to throw anything out of

616
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,740
whack just because it wants more uh

617
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:09,719
potassium don't just feed a whole bunch

618
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,419
of potassium and nothing else but

619
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:15,900
nutrients wise those are the two

620
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:17,700
um micro or macro nutrients that really

621
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,159
can have an effect on your bud density

622
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,919
it really can and I have a horror story

623
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:26,580
when it comes to too much nitrogen I uh

624
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:28,140
way back then uh when I first started I

625
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:30,000
was using bottle nutrients you know the

626
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:33,360
fox farm Trio that's what I started out

627
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,220
with me too and uh good good lineup I

628
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,259
had some really good results off of it

629
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:40,140
however

630
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:41,940
um I got overconfident early on and you

631
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,038
know I was first I was checking the PPM

632
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,200
and pH and all that stuff and things

633
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:47,879
were good and then my next grow I was

634
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,319
overconfident I was like I don't need to

635
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,659
check pH and PP I'm just going to read

636
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:56,939
the plant well I overfed early in veg

637
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:59,659
and my actually into veg into flour hour

638
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,159
and I was still continuing to feed

639
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:04,320
especially calmag is another thing

640
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,120
because some Cal mags do have a nitrogen

641
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,220
in it as well so you need to really be

642
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:10,439
careful with Cal Mag a lot of people cut

643
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,298
off Cal Mag for the first three weeks of

644
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,400
flowering to make sure they're not

645
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:16,619
feeding too much nitrogen in there so

646
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,900
that's one thing but I uh was ignorant

647
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:20,519
to the fact that I had nitrogen toxicity

648
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,860
so I had nitrogen toxicity going into

649
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:26,278
flour and then it was like week four

650
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:27,719
five and I was like what's up with these

651
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:29,940
buds these are kind of weird looking

652
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,558
what's going on this isn't natural this

653
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,840
isn't how my other buds look maybe it's

654
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:37,440
the cultivar well no it was too much

655
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:39,839
nitrogen flowering loose Airy Buzz just

656
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,400
disgusting and uh unfortunately there

657
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,678
was no way of rebounding you know I was

658
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,600
in week five weeks six of flower and it

659
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,759
flushed the plant but it was a lost

660
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:49,619
cause you know I spent the last couple

661
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,259
weeks the buds kind of dead stuff a

662
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:54,839
little bit but it was still nowhere near

663
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:57,298
as it should be and the final product

664
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:59,038
was horrible I ended up uh actually it

665
00:25:57,298 --> 00:26:01,440
affected the taste too it definitely

666
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,759
affected the taste it was gross and I

667
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,980
threw away most of the Harvest

668
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:06,658
unfortunately because of that so I'm

669
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,519
glad you mentioned nitrogen as far as

670
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:10,260
impacting blood structure and the bud

671
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:11,700
density because it absolutely can you

672
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:14,099
need to make sure that going into flour

673
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,900
you don't have an abundance of nitrogen

674
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:18,000
in there and I'm also glad you mentioned

675
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,620
potassium towards the end of flowering

676
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,419
because a lot of people do use that in

677
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:23,819
the final few weeks to bulk up those

678
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:25,080
flowers and dense up those flowers but

679
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:26,939
another thing you know you mentioned

680
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:29,639
don't overdo it right so you have to

681
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:32,038
figure out how much should you be adding

682
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,960
in towards the end of flowering to make

683
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:35,819
sure you're not overdoing it you know if

684
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,100
you have an imbalance of nutrients in

685
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:40,439
the medium for example too much

686
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:43,619
potassium could lock out some of the

687
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,720
other cations right calcium magnesium so

688
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:48,239
on and so forth so balance balance

689
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,640
balance but certainly if you are a

690
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,798
Precision grower you know you Precision

691
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,200
feeding throughout the grill you can

692
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,599
Tinker with the nutrition in order to

693
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,759
try to achieve a better bun density and

694
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,619
and you kind of hit on like a uh you

695
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,480
know one of the hidden things too you

696
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:05,639
mentioned you the cow mag and if you

697
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,500
look on the back of uh a lot of your

698
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,299
different supplemental bottles um

699
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,099
calcium and magnesium being one of them

700
00:27:09,298 --> 00:27:14,158
you'll see like it's either calcium

701
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:15,959
nitrate or calcium sulfite and yes

702
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,020
that's where sometimes the nitrate is

703
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,720
the nitrogen uh that is where that can

704
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:24,000
sneak into the program uh accidentally

705
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,298
is you know you're kind of topping it on

706
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,919
and two you know look at the bottles to

707
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:31,440
see if it already has calcium and

708
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:34,140
magnesium in it as well so yeah those

709
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,220
were things that I learned the I guess

710
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,919
hard way

711
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,740
I learned over time how about that yeah

712
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,020
really good call outs for sure size of

713
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,538
the plant I want to get into that

714
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:48,000
uh I released a video talking about why

715
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:50,460
I grow small plants and there was some

716
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,679
people in there that there was the

717
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,380
debate in the comments section about

718
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:57,240
quality versus quantity and there are

719
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,820
people in there that say I'd rather grow

720
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:03,240
small plants with Dent Buds versus

721
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:05,460
larger plants with looser buds does the

722
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,579
side of the plant relate to how dense

723
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:11,100
the buds will be at all

724
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:14,038
um kind of a two-parter answer the the

725
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:15,719
natural size of it if it was left you

726
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:17,640
know in the wild

727
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,740
um sativas again are typically taller

728
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,440
than indicas are shorter

729
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,120
um so in that sense yes but in the in

730
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,940
the probably the more applicable sense

731
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,619
of like if I grow it a foot taller If I

732
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,620
Grow It three feet tall regardless of

733
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:33,899
whether it's Indica sativa hybrid

734
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:35,819
um I honestly don't think so

735
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:38,278
um I kind of like to grow small plants

736
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:41,460
as well uh it gives me

737
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:44,460
more control over the amount of harvests

738
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:47,579
and varieties I can have per year versus

739
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:51,058
taking more time and growing a longer

740
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:53,579
vegetative state so

741
00:28:51,058 --> 00:28:56,819
you're going to have if you let

742
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:59,759
something veg longer ultimately your

743
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:01,678
Cola will be larger but that doesn't

744
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,980
necessarily mean it will be denser I

745
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,778
think you can achieve the same density

746
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,819
with all the same conditions on a small

747
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:11,339
plant I completely agree I've grown

748
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:14,639
small plants with Airy Buds and I've

749
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:16,980
grown larger plant well in my personal

750
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,480
opinion when I was a home grower like a

751
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,599
five foot plant which is kind of larger

752
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,798
for me and had dense buds so I

753
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:24,898
completely agree with you that I don't

754
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,460
think the actual size of the plant is

755
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:28,798
going to be the determining fact of

756
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,600
whether or not the plant has 10 spots or

757
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,759
not right and you know don't you know

758
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:34,219
don't get it confused with yields a

759
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:38,038
larger plant will have a larger yield

760
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:39,960
but again sometimes quality is of the

761
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:42,538
essence or you know in my case I need

762
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,720
variety and I like to have it frequently

763
00:29:42,538 --> 00:29:48,119
so I do it faster that's just shorter

764
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,038
plants that makes sense how about plant

765
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:53,639
training let's talk about low stress

766
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:55,679
training topping super cropping does any

767
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,399
of that stuff impact blood density at

768
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,880
all

769
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:02,099
it does in the sense that so basically

770
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,799
the common theme amongst all of those

771
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:06,959
the topping uh low stress trainings

772
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,639
super cropping you're trying to get a

773
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,038
level canopy

774
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,980
um and one thing that a level cam canopy

775
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:16,679
promotes is the even distribution of

776
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:20,339
auxins basically the energy the Go Juice

777
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:22,740
in the plants so if you if you grew it

778
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:25,019
like a Christmas tree all of the auxins

779
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,298
are going towards that apical

780
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:30,119
meristem it's going towards the very top

781
00:30:27,298 --> 00:30:31,558
all plants are this way because it sends

782
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:33,298
the most energy to the top because it

783
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:35,158
wants to pollinate or get pollinated

784
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:37,139
that's where it all happens

785
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:38,820
um but when we lay it down it's even

786
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,860
redistribution because they're all the

787
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:43,099
top so it wants the plant wants to give

788
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:46,619
each of them an equal chance to survive

789
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:48,959
so it does create denser buds in the

790
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:50,819
sense that yes hormonally they're all

791
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,919
getting the same amount of you know

792
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:55,139
energy juice as the catch-all I love

793
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:57,600
that so scientific

794
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:00,600
um but also with the level canopy you

795
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:02,339
were able to get the light closer to all

796
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:05,038
of them instead of having one flower

797
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:07,740
here and one flower here they're all

798
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:09,298
here it's an equal measurement you're

799
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,778
able to give them the same amount of

800
00:31:09,298 --> 00:31:16,220
intensity so yes plant training in those

801
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:18,359
ways can help you get denser buds

802
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,519
secondarily okay and then what about

803
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:22,798
some of the plant pruning techniques

804
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:25,558
such as lollipopping I mean you often

805
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:28,019
hear about that as uh you know getting

806
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:29,819
rid of that larf on the bottom there and

807
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,918
promoting the the blood density at the

808
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:34,500
top so lollipopping and I want to throw

809
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,240
defoliating in there as well do those

810
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,940
things contribute to Bud density

811
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,120
I think that it does so and just kind of

812
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,919
the logic of lollipopping to me is you

813
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:46,619
know there there's only a hundred

814
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,940
percent of energy a plant can expend now

815
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:51,058
if you have

816
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:54,120
50 places for that 100 of energy to go

817
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:56,038
it goes there but if you remove some of

818
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:59,219
those and give you know that hundred

819
00:31:56,038 --> 00:32:02,879
percent of energy 30 places to go

820
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:06,058
it's going to give the places it's going

821
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,220
more energy so yes it takes away uh if

822
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:11,158
you lollipop it spends less energy

823
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:15,000
trying to grow those lower shoots lower

824
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:17,899
flowers sends that energy to the top uh

825
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,460
defoliation is

826
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:22,139
Catch-22 there

827
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,940
I don't think anybody successfully

828
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,940
proved anybody right or wrong here

829
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:29,278
there's definitely some thoughts to it

830
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,899
and here's here's mine

831
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,319
um

832
00:32:29,898 --> 00:32:36,418
defoliation can help in a sense of

833
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:38,099
getting light to lower Bud sites but

834
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:40,440
again if it's a certain amount of

835
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:42,178
distance away from the light source

836
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,419
that's why we lollipop we want to bring

837
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:47,759
everything up towards the light

838
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:49,140
um but there's a sink and a source

839
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,940
relationship so the leaves

840
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,740
photosynthesize and people are like well

841
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,580
photosynthesis is the power that drives

842
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:59,579
it this photosensitive photosynthesis

843
00:32:55,579 --> 00:33:02,220
basically turns everything into sugars

844
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:04,798
the sinks are some of the older leaves

845
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,538
they sink or they they take more than

846
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:10,139
they generate whereas the new leafs are

847
00:33:06,538 --> 00:33:12,359
generating a lot of sugars so in my

848
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,940
opinion at the point of where it becomes

849
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:17,219
a sink versus a source like sometimes

850
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:19,500
you get older thicker yellow or leaves

851
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,419
towards the bottom I'll remove those

852
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,778
because I don't think it's generating

853
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:28,440
more sugars than it's taking and in that

854
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:30,898
Essence it's going to send that away to

855
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:34,259
the other areas Bud production that

856
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:36,599
needs more sugars and I do know that it

857
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:39,058
has been shown that when you do you know

858
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:41,219
lollipopping or taking off side branches

859
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:43,339
which is a little bit more drastic than

860
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:46,019
defoliation but similar thought there

861
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:49,740
those sugars do get redirected to

862
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:51,599
auxiliary tips so yeah I think they help

863
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:54,058
that's a long answer I'm sorry but they

864
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:56,278
do help in both instances I believe

865
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:57,960
that's an interesting perspective on

866
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:00,179
that one and yeah I just want to add to

867
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,740
the lollipopping I mean you kind of

868
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:04,320
touched on this is the the lower

869
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:06,480
branches aren't receiving as much light

870
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:07,558
I just want to emphasize that because in

871
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,838
the beginning episode we talked about

872
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:12,719
low light levels contributing to the

873
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:14,639
loosier airier buds right it's just not

874
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,019
receiving the light that it needs down

875
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,619
towards the bottom of the plant in order

876
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:21,480
to dense up but again genetic genetics

877
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:22,800
yes I've had some cultivars that even

878
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,000
with those low levels of light they're

879
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,039
still going to dense up at the bottom

880
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,559
and be rock hard and and really nice

881
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:30,179
buds so and and you did find a gem there

882
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,159
because that is kind of the Rarity you

883
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:34,980
know I in the saying nobody likes to

884
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,079
trim larf that's why we lollipop

885
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:40,079
um I firmly put myself in that category

886
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:42,779
I have no patience for it so

887
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,699
again I just feel that without it more

888
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,440
energy will go to the top and I guess to

889
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:48,118
kind of frame my answer my answer is

890
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,280
always I'm always thinking the top the

891
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,280
top the top not necessarily what was

892
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,500
below so I have a viewer question here

893
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,480
stem splitting will stem splitting

894
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,760
result in denser buds someone said it

895
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,260
does first of all actually just take a

896
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,020
step back can you tell us what stem

897
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:06,000
splitting is and then answer whether or

898
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:09,358
not it helps with blood density okay so

899
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,400
yeah the most common uh stem splitting

900
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:13,139
I've seen Is people driving a nail or

901
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,900
something through the bottom stock as

902
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:18,118
they get close to harvest uh to kind of

903
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,160
split it there now are you talking about

904
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:21,960
it in that sense or maybe like a

905
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,179
mainlining sense where you're snapping

906
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,858
them earlier on they were talking about

907
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:27,899
doing actual stem splitting where

908
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:31,259
they're shoving a nail in and they say

909
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:33,539
that the stress on the plant causes the

910
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:36,060
buds to dance up

911
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:37,739
you're definitely creating a plant

912
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:40,380
stressor

913
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:42,539
um I don't think that is going to dense

914
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,019
your buds up we do know controlled

915
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:48,300
stress can create different results

916
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:52,440
usually it's in the form of cannabinoids

917
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:55,079
it's not biomass so I'm just going to

918
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,119
say no all together to this one but but

919
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:00,839
being technical yes things like water

920
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:03,720
stress it'll increase the cannabinoid uh

921
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:06,119
volume but not the biomass volume so it

922
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:10,259
does nothing for your bud density I had

923
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:13,260
to ask yeah people do it people I mean

924
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:16,020
that's older than me all right come on

925
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:17,940
now yeah so is there anything else that

926
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:20,280
can help with Bud density that we didn't

927
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,059
cover in this episode

928
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,339
um

929
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:26,219
I did I did have a couple of things that

930
00:36:23,338 --> 00:36:29,460
came up to to top of my mind again we're

931
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:31,559
talking light intensity spacing spacing

932
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,720
in your tent

933
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:36,119
um because plants will have this thing

934
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:37,919
called shade avoidance uh if they're all

935
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,320
flowering and they're all very close

936
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,900
together you know each one wants to get

937
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,480
above the other to get the most light

938
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,880
the most intensity so if you're in a

939
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,519
really cramped area your plants are

940
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:53,820
going to be trying to grow up instead of

941
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:55,800
put on the flowers so spacing is one

942
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:58,880
thing that could do it

943
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:01,440
um patience patience with your Harvest

944
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,559
uh you know the old saying is when you

945
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,079
think it's done wait another week

946
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:10,699
inspect your trichomes you don't see

947
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:13,440
huge amounts of uh difference between

948
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:16,078
usually one week or the next at the very

949
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,059
end but if you were if you had a flower

950
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,560
that was truly 11 weeks and at nine

951
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:22,858
weeks you're just waiting to pull it

952
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:25,500
down if you let it go full term you're

953
00:37:22,858 --> 00:37:27,960
going to have denser buds

954
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,460
um and then I guess the last thing too

955
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,760
and this is something you could focus on

956
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:34,500
earlier in the in the grow your root

957
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,920
zone bigger the roots the bigger the

958
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:40,079
fruits so get your root Zone on point

959
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,139
that's only going to be able to bring in

960
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,700
more food and nutrients for the buds and

961
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:47,219
they will be denser because of a

962
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:48,838
healthier root system so those are the

963
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:50,519
last few things that I kind of had there

964
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:53,219
how about the products that are on the

965
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:54,960
market that people are subrox being sold

966
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:56,639
that people say this is going to help

967
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,260
with blood density what are your

968
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:59,879
thoughts on those I can't name them any

969
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,260
right now I can't think of any in and

970
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,720
name them but there are some out there

971
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,640
and I've seen them and yeah I mean we

972
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:09,539
can probably picture the label

973
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:12,118
um no I I buy a lot of this as snake

974
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:15,480
juice I've tried a lot of different

975
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:18,059
things again you know 20 more yields 40

976
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,699
more you as compared to what is the

977
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:22,619
first question but I do like to A and B

978
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:24,719
A lot of things and I've also done this

979
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:26,119
with you know lollipopping all the way

980
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:29,039
down versus not

981
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:30,599
majority of the time especially with

982
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:32,400
these type of products

983
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:35,820
I couldn't tell you one way or the other

984
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,800
like control a looks like control B at

985
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:40,680
the end of the day there's there's very

986
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,859
few things that have made significant

987
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:45,440
differences but uh no one of the most

988
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:47,519
common ones though is probably again

989
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,900
photosynthesis make sugars plant likes

990
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,320
and sugars makes it grow people have

991
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,358
talked about adding molasses to the soil

992
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,619
in the end

993
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:58,319
the plant really isn't going to benefit

994
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:01,079
through the Molasses the microorganisms

995
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,240
in the soil they like it now it's the

996
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:06,720
microorganisms that make nutrients plant

997
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:09,239
available so in a way yes that can help

998
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:11,639
but that's not something that if you're

999
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:14,399
not using like a heavy biologically

1000
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:16,618
active soil putting molasses in I don't

1001
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,300
think is going to make denser buds for

1002
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:21,838
you I think one thing that comes to mind

1003
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:24,839
for me that people used to add in all

1004
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:27,480
the time but it's very harmful to humans

1005
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:32,480
which is I never pronounce this right

1006
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,480
black drill butresol Paco pack

1007
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:37,500
you have information about that or what

1008
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,019
Pac low bud so

1009
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,940
um this is a common farming product if

1010
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:44,759
you actually go to Google and type in

1011
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:48,539
exploding watermelons China you'll see

1012
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:52,079
what happens so the the their pgrs uh

1013
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:54,000
pgr some are good some are bad some are

1014
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,920
natural some are synthetic this follows

1015
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,539
under they're really bad and synthetic

1016
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,700
category

1017
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:01,739
um it just multiplies the cell so fast

1018
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:05,879
and they fed this field of watermelons

1019
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:09,959
uh some of this paclo pgrs and the the

1020
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:12,780
it grew so so fast they exploded so yeah

1021
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,358
that's very harmful uh very harmful to

1022
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,060
humans especially when combusted so that

1023
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:20,578
is

1024
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:23,639
one of the reasons why I'm glad we have

1025
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:25,140
um markets for these safe markets

1026
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:27,239
because that's a that's a product that

1027
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:29,279
was widely used in the past and it

1028
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:33,358
absolutely will not fly in today's

1029
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,940
markets so uh yeah don't use it kids

1030
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:37,980
adults especially on consumables right

1031
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:41,700
you know some I know they use a lot in

1032
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:44,059
succulents to keep them small but uh as

1033
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:46,139
far as using it on consumables

1034
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:49,679
unfortunately it's a carcinogen right

1035
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:52,739
that's very harmful there so avoid that

1036
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:54,598
at all costs so wrapping things up how

1037
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:57,000
can the listeners find you and what do

1038
