1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,879
coming up on garden talk you could take

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,200
all of those elements combine them

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,120
multiply that number by five and you

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,759
still have more carbon inside of the

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,599
plants by dry weight carbon can turn

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,359
into hundreds of thousands of different

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,118
molecules some of them you can see

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,719
others you can't sometimes you can

9
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,719
detect it it's aromatic and you can

10
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,320
smell it other times you can't so it's

11
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,559
really difficult to pinpoint carbon

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,480
deficiencies organic farmers have living

13
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,559
soils and the living soil is basically

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,080
like a giant sponge for carbon so if you

15
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,159
feed the soil you take care of your

16
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,079
microbes and your fungi and you're doing

17
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,000
things like molasses or amino acid

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,359
supplementation with plant ferments

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,960
that's a really good way to supplement

20
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,600
the carbonate how do you deliver carbon

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,840
most effectively one of those is co2 the

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,079
other is soluble carbon and if you do it

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,520
right you can actually far surpass that

24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,679
quality metric you would otherwise

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,960
assume to get with no

26
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,960
co2 supplementation

27
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,440
whatsoever what's up everybody if you

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,198
that don't know me my name is chris aka

29
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,280
mr growit and you're tuned into the

30
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,920
garden talk podcast this episode number

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,920
76. in this episode i interview nick

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,478
nicolaive he has been gardening for 25

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,960
years and is the owner of rooted leaf

34
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,640
agrotech he has a significant amount of

35
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,719
knowledge when it comes to carbon and

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,400
that's what we get into today he not

37
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,319
only gets into some beginner and

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,400
intermediate knowledge but dives into

39
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,319
some biochemistry for all of you looking

40
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,920
for some advanced knowledge thanks to

this podcast is to bring zero cost for

47
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,118
information about gardening all plants

48
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,560
to the general public that being said

49
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,239
i'd like to thank the sponsors of

00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,319
their quality grow tents they have a

55
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,078
super strong frame thick canvas density

56
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,319
and a height adjusting roof

57
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,559
it comes with a one foot extension kit

58
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,798
and a two foot extension kit is optional

59
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,399
so you can grow even taller plants they

60
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,159
also have the light line

61
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,479
same quality as the original gorilla

62
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,239

and we are back welcome to the garden

98
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,680
talk podcast today i am joined with nick

99
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,280
nick alive how you doing today i'm doing

100
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,439
well chris how are you

101
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,799
doing great thanks for asking today

102
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,400
we're going to talk about the essential

103
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,879
element carbon

104
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,719
so lots of people think it's just co2

105
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,399
being added to their environment and

106
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,120
that's it which is

107
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,280
pretty far from the truth right there's

108
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,920
so much more to it and nick's going to

109
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,318
break it down for us today but uh before

110
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,079
we get deep into carbon what i like to

111
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,759
do with all the guests is an

112
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,280
introduction so can you tell us a little

113
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,318
bit about yourself and how you got into

114
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,680
gardening

115
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:10,958
yeah yeah you know i've been gardening

116
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,959
for a very long time i live in the

117
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,878
pacific northwest just north of seattle

118
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,639
a little bit that's where we have a

119
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,560
manufacturing plant

120
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,478
but even before i got into manufacturing

121
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,720
fertilizers and being so

122
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,478
interested in carbon uh

123
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,240
you know i come from a family where my

124
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,240
parents kind of you know forced us to go

125
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,439
out in the garden and spend time outside

126
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,040
so i learned

127
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,879
from an early age quite a bit about

128
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,479
different types of plants different

129
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,399
things that people are growing as food

130
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,319
for example

131
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,000
so i've always been

132
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,519
intrigued by it you know the idea that

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,120
you can

134
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,639
grow very nutrient dense food for

135
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,319
yourself and you can kind of provide for

136
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,879
yourself and take care of your family

137
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,399
and its needs um just as a result of

138
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,319
gardening so

139
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,000
yeah yeah

140
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,759
so what would you say your overall

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,759
gardening style is you know some people

142
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,919
are indoors some people are outdoors

143
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,080
some people go after organic or

144
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,680
synthetic some people are hydroponic

145
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,519
systems while they're other in soil or

146
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,800
even cocoa what's your style of

147
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,719
gardening

148
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,400
i mean i i guess you could say i prefer

149
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,759
a balance between all of those things i

150
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,519
think there's value to controlled

151
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,360
environment agriculture

152
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,680
where you can grow things indoors like

153
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,000
mint and you know other crops year round

154
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,680
for example and you can target specific

155
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,759
light frequencies to kind of generate

156
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,199
the compounds you're looking for

157
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,600
but i also find

158
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,038
a huge amount of passion and inspiration

159
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,400
behind

160
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,038
being a little bit more connected to

161
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,560
nature and just growing outdoors

162
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,719
and kind of being you know in tune with

163
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,240
the season so you know that being said i

164
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,639
also kind of take the same approach to

165
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,560
the question of you know organic versus

166
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,519
synthetic fertilizers i do think that

167
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,360
there are

168
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,198
uh good ideas that have come out of you

169
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,919
know synthetic fertilizer industries i

170
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,759
do think that there's some products that

171
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,599
are synthesized that you know they're

172
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,280
good plants respond very well to them

173
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,759
they're natural in the sense that

174
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,439
they're you know biologically available

175
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,199
uh to plants into microbes and they

176
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,120
don't really cause

177
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,800
uh detrimental effects when used

178
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,240
appropriately

179
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,439
same thing is true of organic

180
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,519
agriculture i think there's a lot of

181
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,879
great great ideas there's maybe a couple

182
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,399
of things that

183
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,000
have been shown to like if you refine

184
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,599
them over time that they just perform a

185
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
little bit better so

186
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,439
um yeah yeah i think a fair balance of

187
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,800
everything is good

188
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,839
nice nice

189
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,000
so let's get into carbon and kind of

190
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,478
just started with a basic question what

191
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,360
is carbon and how is it beneficial for

192
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:31,519
plants

193
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,759
uh i always refer to carbon as the

194
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,599
forgotten macronutrient you know because

195
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,280
when people typically think of plant

196
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,960
fertilizers

197
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,918
what comes to mind is

198
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,839
you know then pk's so nitrogen uh

199
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:46,639
phosphorus potassium

200
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:49,758
calcium magnesium right calm fixes

201
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,918
everything that cures everything

202
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,598
and then sulfur and other micronutrients

203
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,359
that are responsible in very very small

204
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,079
quantities but the truth of the matter

205
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,919
is you could take all of those elements

206
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,199
combine them multiply that number by

207
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,198
five

208
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,000
and you still have more carbon

209
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,439
inside of the plants by dry weight in

210
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,918
almost all cases i think there's

211
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,439
probably very few exceptions with

212
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,439
certain crops like maybe horsetail

213
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,360
accumulates a ton of silicon and so you

214
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,038
have tighter numbers around the carbon

215
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,439
thing but you know by and large every

216
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:21,439
plant that people are familiar with from

217
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,560
more medicinal therapeutic plants even

218
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,000
to

219
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,478
food crops like if we're measuring

220
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,720
bricks inside of grapes for example or

221
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,519
alpha acids inside of hops that are used

222
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,039
to

223
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,639
brew beer

224
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,120
all of those compounds that are being

225
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,800
measured and produced by the plants

226
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,319
come down to being mostly carbon by

227
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,840
weight so carbon is a very important

228
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,000
macronutrient

229
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,318
the way that most people think about

230
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,918
carbon supplementation is you know the

231
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,759
traditional or conventional approaches

232
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,839
to find a way to

233
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,840
seal off a space and introduce carbon

234
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,198
dioxide into the equation and sometimes

235
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,638
you see this in a greenhouse type of

236
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,919
setting as well but

237
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,519
it's a little bit more tricky to do more

238
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,120
difficult to do

239
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,918
and it's not really like if you think

240
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,918
about co2 as just being one molecule

241
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,680
versus the hundreds of thousands of

242
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:06,878
different molecules that plants produce

243
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,240
with carbon

244
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,759
it's almost like it doesn't do it

245
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,598
justice maybe there's a better way to

246
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,520
supplement different types of carbon

247
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,439
different flavors of carbon

248
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,680
that are maybe a little bit more useful

249
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,519
to something specific the plants are

250
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,680
trying to do so

251
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,758
carbon i think is a very interesting

252
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,000
macronutrient and an element that a lot

253
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,400
of growers overlook partially because

254
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,240
it's really complex chemistry

255
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,639
um you know i can give you an example

256
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,399
with nitrogen for example when most

257
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,679
crops are deficient in nitrogen one of

258
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,038
the first things that you see is a

259
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,158
yellow leaf

260
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,639
and so

261
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,399
this indicates that there's a problem

262
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,720
with chlorophyll biosynthesis in the

263
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,200
plants so if you supplement the nitrogen

264
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,200
that the plants are looking for that um

265
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,519
chlorophyll deficiency goes away and the

266
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,360
green color comes back to the leaf

267
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,200
you know and that's kind of a very

268
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,039
linear type of thing to say well the

269
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,360
nitrogen that's in the fertilizer

270
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,719
whether it's organic or conventional

271
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,039
you apply it on the crop and you see

272
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,399
this you know color change carbon can

273
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,599
turn into

274
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,360
hundreds of thousands of different

275
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,200
molecules some of them you can see

276
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,800
others you can't sometimes you can

277
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,800
detect it it's aromatic and you can

278
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,399
smell it other times you can't so it's

279
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,958
really difficult to pinpoint carbon

280
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,120
deficiencies in plants unlike it is

281
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:21,199
magnesium and sulfur and nitrogen those

282
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,159
will all yellow the leaves and so you

283
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,920
only have you know so many different

284
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,159
reasons as to why it can be deficient in

285
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,159
these elements and why you're seeing the

286
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,079
types of you know discoloration on the

287
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,319
leaf surface that you might be seeing in

288
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,720
your garden so carbon on the flip side

289
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,640
is very complex and i think that just

290
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,399
maybe scares some people or

291
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,919
you know turns them off from itself but

292
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,519
it's a very important macro nutrient for

293
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,879
sure

294
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,600
gotcha so how is carbon and taken by the

295
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:52,320
plant and how is it metabolized uh so

296
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,040
carbon is taken in primarily through uh

297
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,600
an enzyme called rubisco this this is

298
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,599
this is the most abundant enzyme on

299
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,120
planet earth um

300
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,200
it has one job basically it's like a

301
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,240
giant vacuum cleaner that sucks co2 out

302
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,839
of the air and it smashes it into

303
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,919
a

304
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,399
sugar basically a phosphate sugar and

305
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,879
this makes it soluble for the plants to

306
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,519
then take it and move it around you know

307
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:20,159
because co2 is not very soluble in water

308
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,839
unlike sugars or highly soluble water

309
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,039
it's kind of like along the lines of if

310
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,800
you have

311
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,559
a can of soda

312
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,719
and you open it up on a warm summer day

313
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,479
all that co2 wants to leave and if you

314
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,399
leave your can of soda out for even 20

315
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,959
or 30 minutes you're gonna find all that

316
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,200
co2 has escaped so plants have to deal

317
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,278
with the same laws and same laws of

318
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,040
physics and that the co2 they're trying

319
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,639
to capture

320
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,000
wants to be released it wants to kind of

321
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:45,919
go back out because it's not very

322
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,519
soluble so what they do is they have to

323
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,838
transform it chemically they use the

324
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,720
energy of the sun

325
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,360
to actually power this process

326
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,360
the process involves taking co2 out of

327
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,759
the air and smashing it into a sugar

328
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,759
that's then useful as a building block

329
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,480
to make things like new you know new

330
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,639
root hairs for example or specific types

331
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,200
of sugar that can feed microbes in the

332
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,838
soil or other compounds that can help

333
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,640
plants deal with nutrient deficiencies

334
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,720
as is true with the case of phosphorus

335
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,559
plants will take that carbon out of the

336
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,519
air and they'll make a very specific

337
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,599
flavor of carbon to then inject into the

338
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,679
roots just outside of or i'm sorry you

339
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,360
know injected into the soil

340
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,359
just outside the root hairs and this

341
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,200
compound frees up phosphorus that may be

342
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,879
unavailable to the plants it may be

343
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,879
there it just needs a little bit of

344
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,799
chemical transformation and so the

345
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,200
plants use the power of the sun taking

346
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:42,159
the carbon and then squeeze this

347
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,320
compound out through the roots to allow

348
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,480
nutrient solubilization and nutrient

349
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,120
uptake to happen

350
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,800
so it's uh it starts off as co2 in the

351
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,399
air by and large

352
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,399
but then quite literally anything and

353
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,919
everything a plant can do

354
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,679
is going to revolve around carbon

355
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,958
metabolism i mean roots growing through

356
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,719
soil is a function of carbon for sure um

357
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,039
because carbon makes up the actual what

358
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,240
the root hairs are it's like 80 to 90

359
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,078
percent roughly

360
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,720
i would say you know dehydrated root

361
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:11,759
masses predominantly carbon

362
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,120
by way

363
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,360
a lot of people are

364
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,039
supplementing co2 these days they want

365
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,720
that increased levels of co2 in their

366
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,799
environment but that's not the only way

367
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,519
to really get carbon in there right what

368
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,439
are some ways to supplement carbon

369
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,440
there's you know carbon based

370
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,279
fertilizers generally speaking are

371
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,040
relatively new

372
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,600
you know typically we have

373
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,120
conventional or salt based or synthetic

374
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,560
fertilizers and then we have something

375
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,320
that's more natural or organic

376
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,239
sometimes they're plant and animal based

377
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,320
you may find things like kelp extracts

378
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,399
out there on the market plus

379
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,040
crab shell meal and fish hydrolysates

380
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,399
and

381
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,078
emulsions things of that nature

382
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,839
certainly blood meal bone meal all this

383
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,239
stuff so you have these two kind of

384
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,079
categories or um umbrellas that have

385
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,759
been defined for you know the past at

386
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,638
least 100 years if not several thousand

387
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,759
years

388
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,120
um

389
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,120
i would say you know a lot of the

390
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,078
natural and organic options out there do

391
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,679
have carbon inside of them but

392
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,278
there's sort of new technologies being

393
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,559
developed that target carbon

394
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:13,919
specifically

395
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,919
and those are the carbon-based

396
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,278
fertilizers so

397
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,120
without you know getting into something

398
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,200
specific like a carbon-based fertilizer

399
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,679
line you know the organic options might

400
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,480
include something like the kelp extract

401
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,399
molasses any kind of plant ferment which

402
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,079
i know the k f guys the korean natural

403
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,519
farming community

404
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,359
they're very heavy into that type of

405
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,879
stuff and what happens during these

406
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,680
reactions is you get these really

407
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,600
soluble forms of carbon that that are

408
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,679
like powerful electrolytes you know so

409
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,839
they can help plants maintain an

410
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,958
electrical charge balance

411
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,800
and this is really important because

412
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,319
they're taking in energy from the sun

413
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,159
which is you know inherently just

414
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,440
electron energy initially

415
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,360
um

416
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,800
so it helps them to you know perform

417
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,320
this process of charge balance if you

418
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:59,599
can get the right kinds of carbon into

419
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,079
them co2 in the air is

420
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,639
interesting because it's just a single

421
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:07,359
uh carbon atom just one is in there but

422
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,120
it's also fully oxidized the o2 so as

423
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,519
plants go through this process it

424
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,360
requires energy to break down whereas if

425
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,679
you're focused on like good soil health

426
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,440
good soil chemistry maybe you got my

427
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,120
microbes that you're supplementing amino

428
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,959
acids if you're doing like plant

429
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,480
ferments you're getting carbon from that

430
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,879
for sure and that's going to help

431
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,959
energize the soil it's going to

432
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,480
get the plants to grow a little bit more

433
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,159
vigorously so

434
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,240
yeah and i don't think you know on the

435
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,319
uh on the synthetic or the conventional

436
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,159
side i don't think there's too many

437
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,399
um options out there that are carbon

438
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,958
based i think that a lot of the

439
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,799
synthetic fertilizers have just focused

440
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,399
on things like you know nitrogen and

441
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,679
phosphorus and potassium

442
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,759
sort of at the expense or at the

443
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,679
sacrifice of

444
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,958
carbon because you're not going to find

445
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,719
you know like a bloom booster is

446
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,479
typically just a mono-potassium

447
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,639
phosphate so you really have like two

448
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,959
elements sometimes some manufacturers

449
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,320
will throw in some sulfur because sulfur

450
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,599
can help in the flowering stage for

451
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,560
certain crops

452
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,639
this is

453
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,719
particularly true of tobacco and pops

454
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,839
and other such

455
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,000
you know flowering plants

456
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,639
but you know there's no carbon as a

457
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,320
macronutrient kind of source there

458
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,000
overall so

459
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,920
yeah yeah it seems like there's more and

460
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,600
more people going towards the carbon

461
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,439
based fertilizers

462
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,278
and i hear a lot of great results from

463
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,639
people using them so that's one way to

464
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:28,879
supplement and then kind of the other

465
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,039
way mentioned was the co2 in the

466
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,720
atmosphere right supplementing co2 i

467
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:34,958
want to hone in on that a little bit

468
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,560
more uh and we'll probably circle back

469
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,198
around to the carbon-based fertilizers

470
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,559
but let's talk about supplementing co2

471
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,479
in the air there are so many different

472
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,638
ways to go about it i mean i had the the

473
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,079
tnb naturals canisters

474
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,360
those you know you shake those up every

475
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,399
day put them in there and they release

476
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,560
co2 you've got those co2x hail bags the

477
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,078
mushroom bags that don't actually fruit

478
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,000
that's a way to do it people are

479
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,239
bringing in tanks can you talk to us

480
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,720
about the different ways to supplement

481
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,639
co2 in the grow environment

482
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,560
yeah the most uh controlled way to do it

483
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,159
is to take in a tank of co2 like you

484
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,719
mentioned you just

485
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,000
you know make sure that the room that

486
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,480
you're working with is sealed so it

487
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,320
doesn't off gas all the co2 and then you

488
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,480
need the proper dehumidification load

489
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,079
with air conditioning potential and some

490
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,000
of these systems get pretty expensive

491
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,758
but what it allows people to do is to

492
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,399
target to the nearest say part in a

493
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,480
million or 100 parts per million the co2

494
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,159
concentration in the air

495
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,240
oftentimes some of these facilities that

496
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,759
do this type of controlled agriculture

497
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,240
they'll actually have sensors set up to

498
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,519
automatically open and close the valves

499
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,480
so if they're looking to maintain a

500
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,039
particular

501
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,800
range of co2 saturation in the air

502
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,838
um they can do that automatically more

503
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,599
or less

504
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,360
um you know some of the other ways to do

505
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,879
it if you know in a more simple approach

506
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,240
maybe the room isn't perfectly sealed or

507
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:49,919
you do want a lot of just natural

508
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,639
airflow

509
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,078
you know as is true in the case of

510
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,919
you know like high desert areas for

511
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:57,120
example they may benefit from

512
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:58,399
structuring their approach a little bit

513
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,600
differently

514
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,440
that's when you would look at doing

515
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,120
something like either carbon-based

516
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,959
fertilizer

517
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,480
you know targeted specifically for that

518
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,439
purpose or you might do something more

519
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,599
natural like a lot of um

520
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,038
organic farmers have living soils and

521
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,958
the living soil is basically like a

522
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,798
giant sponge for carbon so if you feed

523
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,640
the soil you take care of your microbes

524
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,038
and your fungi and you're doing things

525
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,079
like you know molasses or amino acid

526
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:25,439
supplementation with plant ferments um

527
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:26,879
that's a really good way to supplement

528
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,880
the carbon into the soil and just have

529
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,600
that kind of process go naturally

530
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,480
because

531
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,399
there's really just two phases of carbon

532
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,400
as sort of like umbrella categories one

533
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,880
would be

534
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,720
a soluble you know a liquid form of

535
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,640
carbon it's got to go in the water and

536
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,400
the second one would be in the air you

537
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,840
know besides that there's no other

538
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,840
medium that's really beneficial

539
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,960
so in the air obviously like i just

540
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:52,719
mentioned earlier presents a little

541
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,720
problem because plants need energy to

542
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,720
actually process that form whereas if

543
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,919
you take care to take care of it in the

544
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,919
soil

545
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,679
the energy might already be down there

546
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,520
just in the form of a microbior fungi

547
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,080
helping the plants grow a little bit

548
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:08,400
more efficiently overall okay and then i

549
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,399
know when supplementing co2 through the

550
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,400
air there's actually a really good study

551
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,360
i believe it came out of utah state

552
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:19,120
university and they found that when they

553
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:22,159
supplemented co2 up to 1400 ppm there

554
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:24,239
was a 30 increase in biomass

555
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,600
so pretty significant

556
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,240
increase in biomass just from

557
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:30,480
supplementing co2 in the air now of

558
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,480
course your other aspects need to be

559
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,558
dialed in right temperature humidity

560
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,240
like vpd your ec

561
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,480
all those things need to be dialed in in

562
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,240
order for you to increase the co2 and

563
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,079
see the benefit from it so i thought

564
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,599
that was definitely worthy of mentioning

565
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:47,038
but my question in regards to that would

566
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:48,159
be what is the optimal amount of co2 in

567
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:49,679
ppm

568
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,640
it's a great question and i think part

569
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,280
of it comes down to it's a it's um

570
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,759
you know think about like a car engine

571
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,200
the amount of biomass that your

572
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,558
crop may produce

573
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,558
maybe you measured in bricks like if

574
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:04,720
you're growing wine grapes for example

575
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,359
that's a frequent measurement or alpha

576
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,279
acids and hops

577
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,798
what you can do is basically equate that

578
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:11,918
to like that that's the horsepower that

579
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:13,440
your motor produced the motor is

580
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,120
obviously the plant whatever's going on

581
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,960
inside of it so in order to get the

582
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,879
maximum productivity or the maximum

583
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,480
horsepower you really have to figure out

584
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,799
how to balance that motor with the

585
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,558
proper amount of air and fuel coming in

586
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,480
with the right amount of spark and then

587
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,079
with right you know sort of exhaust

588
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,000
systems and transmission all the stuff

589
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,759
built around it so plants are very

590
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,200
similar and that the spark is actually

591
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,038
the spark of a motor is actually the

592
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,558
light coming into the plant

593
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,879
and the air fuel ratio you can think

594
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:40,558
about that like the air would be your

595
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,559
co2 concentration which was your

596
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,480
question and then the fuel

597
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:45,839
is the stuff that's coming in from the

598
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,599
roots the water that you're feeding the

599
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,599
plant plus all of the you know

600
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:52,240
macronutrients and micronutrients you

601
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,000
got your balanced and dialed in ec load

602
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,679
what you notice is that as you crank up

603
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,440
the co2 and you crank up the light

604
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,960
intensity the plants actually need a

605
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,200
little more fuel otherwise they're going

606
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,519
to become nutrient deficient

607
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,679
the issue with

608
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,599
well the slippery slope i should say

609
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,280
with co2 supplementation is that if you

610
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,199
do it properly you're creating a larger

611
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,359
demand for nutrient uptake for the

612
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,279
plants and the same is true in reverse

613
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:17,918
if that if you're feeding your plants a

614
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,519
higher ec load and that ec is balanced

615
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,038
to the spark or the light intensity

616
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,918
that's coming in from your

617
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:27,038
artificial or even natural light

618
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,600
then the plants inherently want more co2

619
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,200
you know so the optimal co2 to put it

620
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,038
short kind of depends on how intense are

621
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,720
your lights

622
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:36,079
how heavy are you feeding your plants in

623
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,000
terms of nutrient strength and

624
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,038
composition composition is very

625
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,480
important

626
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,440
and then some of the peripheral stuff

627
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,599
like

628
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,000
the air conditioning you know potential

629
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,599
and the dehumidification potential plus

630
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,599
what's going on in the soil what kind of

631
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,798
medium is somebody growing in because

632
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,759
that's really the sort of the

633
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:55,599
transmission you know a lot of the

634
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,200
soils out there may not be fine-tuned

635
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:58,879
for the crops that are being grown

636
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,679
inside of it and so you lose a portion

637
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,320
of

638
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,720
the fertilizer load for example or the

639
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:07,678
portion of the water uptake ability

640
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,960
whereas if you have the right medium for

641
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,400
the right crop

642
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,919
under the right light intensity and all

643
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,080
that stuff you get the maximum water

644
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,240
uptake you get maximum transpiration and

645
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,000
that just feeds the whole system as far

646
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,079
as how much carbon

647
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,440
can be taken in by the plants i've seen

648
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:26,319
a high-end benefit around 2500 or 3000

649
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,080
ppms which is fairly high and very very

650
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,480
robust but again it's it's a facility

651
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:33,439
that is highly dialed in they have the

652
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,720
equivalent of you know 2000 ppfd

653
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,558
on these plants and they have more

654
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,319
dehumidifiers than

655
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:39,678
you know someone would ever in the right

656
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,960
mind decide that's the number that i

657
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,440
need is just kind of you know through

658
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,960
trial and error and through

659
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,640
sort of learning curves this this

660
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,000
particular grower managed to realize

661
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,919
like hey in this sealed room where i'm

662
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,880
pushing these plants with this much

663
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:55,038
light intensity and this much co2 i need

664
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,080
this much environmental control

665
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:57,599
so

666
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,319
as high as 3000 i would say on the

667
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:02,000
minimum and um if you dial in a good

668
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,839
carbon-based fertilizer program you

669
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,679
actually don't need to supplement co2 at

670
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,000
all because the way that co2

671
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,960
supplementation works

672
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,038
is

673
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,000
that co2 delivers carbon and so really

674
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,839
what we're talking about is how do you

675
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,038
deliver carbon most effectively one of

676
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:18,399
those is co2 the other is soluble carbon

677
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:19,759
and if you do it right you can actually

678
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,919
far surpass

679
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,079
in in my you know what we've seen so far

680
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,159
you can kind of far surpass that quality

681
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,279
metric you would otherwise assume to get

682
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,080
with no

683
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:34,319
co2 supplementation whatsoever

684
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:35,918
wow that's crazy 3 000 ppm of co2 that's

685
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,599
way beyond anything i've ever heard of

686
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,520
i've heard of up to 2 000 and then i

687
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:40,639
heard actually if you're in an

688
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:41,519
environment where there's over two

689
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,520
thousand

690
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,240
three thousand like it's

691
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,359
unsafe to kind of be in that be standing

692
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,359
there and breathing that in and stuff

693
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,959
like that you get headaches or dizziness

694
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,119
or something like that so i'm sure

695
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,159
there's some uh safety precautions that

696
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,079
you have to go through when you're

697
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,600
trying to supplement that high right

698
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,240
yeah yeah you definitely feel it after a

699
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,599
while and it's not a not an ideal um

700
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,759
scenario but it's it's like you know a

701
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,359
high horsepower motor for example these

702
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,839
are just the tire spinning you know it's

703
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:10,399
not necessarily

704
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:12,158
dialed in for maximum efficiency but the

705
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,559
facility is definitely dialed in to

706
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,080
operate at this very very high

707
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:17,839
performance level and you know what

708
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,798
there are notable differences in terms

709
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,199
of decrease in yield and quality if

710
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:26,639
you know if this grower drops below 2000

711
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,840
ppms of co2 but uh part of it is the

712
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,640
biomass

713
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,839
productivity is so high that of course i

714
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,919
mean we're talking about numbers that

715
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,399
are you know far exceed industry

716
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,480
standards and what what the average sort

717
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,759
of is is out there it's basically like

718
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,919
if you had

719
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,759
you know the ability on your hop or your

720
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,600
grape farm for example to double the

721
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,960
biomass per square foot or even in some

722
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:48,719
cases triplet

723
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,919
um that that's effectively the

724
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,079
equivalent of what we're talking about

725
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,440
here i've heard that

726
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:57,278
the general

727
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,640
guidance would be if your ppfd is at

728
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:02,000
1000

729
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,840
your ppms should be at a thousand

730
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,359
would you say that's good general

731
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:07,038
guidance or would you kind of refute

732
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:08,798
that in a way

733
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,798
uh you know it's just it's something

734
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,000
that's so crop specific and even within

735
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:15,038
crops you have different you know

736
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,960
cultivars of like basil and and mint and

737
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,119
things like that and you have different

738
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,640
um you know different responses

739
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:21,599
basically some crops are really heavy

740
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,480
feeders

741
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,000
um you may find particular cultivars

742
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,599
like that tangerine sage that i was

743
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,038
telling you about before the show you

744
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,119
know i'm growing some tangerine sage

745
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:32,720
right now and what i'm finding is it's a

746
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,119
no it's a small plant but it's a pretty

747
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,720
heavy food overall but the the potency

748
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,879
like it smells just like tangerine it's

749
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,880
the craziest plant um

750
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,320
i walked by and when i walked by the

751
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,000
nursery i smelled the leaves and i was

752
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,079
just like dude i looked at it and i was

753
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,359
like dude i have to get this plant it's

754
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,720
just so pungent so potent um so part of

755
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:52,319
it is you know the crops respond

756
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,200
differently to light intensities and

757
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:56,879
also different concentrations of

758
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,240
fertilizer and nutrients and then really

759
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,480
what is the composition of that nutrient

760
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,558
i'd say an even bigger

761
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,000
factor is is airflow through and

762
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:08,240
transpiration potential through the

763
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,798
plant you may be able to get away with

764
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,278
growing at a lower ppm

765
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,879
if you can keep the plant constantly dry

766
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,480
drying out you know in a really dry

767
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,159
environment for example if you focus on

768
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,079
airflow you're going to struggle keeping

769
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,400
the plant in the soil wet enough in some

770
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:23,918
cases this can actually be an advantage

771
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,759
if you know how to feed and set up the

772
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,600
system properly you know but what it

773
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,079
also lets you get away with is a lower

774
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,439
ppm because you're watering more often

775
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,439
and so the plants are kind of going

776
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,919
through that nutrient load

777
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:40,080
more rapidly anyways whereas other crops

778
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,080
i would say you know there's a lot of

779
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,679
you know a lot of performance gains that

780
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:45,519
you would see if you fed pretty heavy

781
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,360
some plants actually like to accumulate

782
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,440
a little bit of extra nutrient load

783
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,439
outside of the rhizosphere uh maybe in

784
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,440
some cases it kind of helps dial in the

785
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,558
chemistry of what they're looking for

786
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,360
you know some

787
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:59,200
um plants for example like acidic soils

788
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,479
i think tomatoes are a good example of

789
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,000
that they kind of prefer something that

790
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,679
drains well and is

791
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,679
slightly acidic but also has tons of

792
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,000
calcium inside of it so these are kind

793
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,720
of like weird things to have perfectly

794
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,480
optimized in nature but certainly in a

795
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,558
controlled environment

796
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,159
you can achieve these things so

797
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:18,480
i'd say there's a range probably give or

798
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,200
take about 25 all things included plus

799
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,000
or minus you know that makes sense

800
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,159
i want to get into co2 monitors a little

801
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,880
bit well first off i hear that co2 is a

802
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,320
heavy gas and it tends to sink i don't

803
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,320
know if there's any truth in that or not

804
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:35,278
maybe you can say that's bro science or

805
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:36,960
actual science uh but due to that people

806
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:38,798
say your co2 monitor should be placed

807
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,400
like on the floor most people have it

808
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,400
placed you know either within the plant

809
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,840
canopy some people have a place at soil

810
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,240
level some people have a place on their

811
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,720
wall where should the co2 monitor be

812
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,319
placed in the grow environment

813
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,079
it's a great question i think it comes

814
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,599
down to air flow you know think about

815
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,199
the composition of

816
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:56,558
air is just like really really tiny

817
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,400
microscopic

818
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:00,240
um

819
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,480
marbles you know that they're just being

820
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,919
pushed around so if you think you've got

821
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,599
these marbles floating around in the air

822
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,759
some of those marbles are oxygen others

823
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:10,240
are co2 i guess if you just let the

824
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:12,480
physics dictate by gravity

825
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,440
the co2 has the extra carbon so of

826
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,440
course it's going to be a little bit

827
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,519
heavier but in a lot of these grow rooms

828
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,360
that supplement co2 they have ample

829
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,879
airflow and i don't think that they are

830
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:22,240
you know the the air flow basically is

831
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,600
pushing all these marbles around they're

832
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,759
hitting each other they're kind of

833
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,439
getting into a flow ideally you want

834
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:29,599
laminar flow inside of your grow room

835
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,558
which is like the air is moving as one

836
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,719
current you don't have a bunch of

837
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:34,319
chaotic flow with these marbles just

838
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,919
kind of like hitting each other because

839
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,240
what that does is it creates dead spots

840
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,559
or it creates pockets of maybe humidity

841
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,839
or even worse low co2 concentrations in

842
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,639
the grow room

843
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:47,678
so you know if you had good airflow in a

844
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,000
room and it circulated well both

845
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,519
across like the horizontal perimeter of

846
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,798
the room and also if you had a lot of

847
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,558
vertical displacement between the

848
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:55,440
ceiling and the floor

849
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:58,558
that would

850
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:02,000
sort of homogenize the air overall and

851
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:05,119
what i would do is i would put um you

852
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,240
know co2 probe probably at the canopy

853
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,599
level

854
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,960
overall for an environment like that

855
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,319
assuming that the air flow is good

856
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,558
because what i want to see off that

857
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,240
sensor is what are my plants detecting

858
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:15,038
in the air the other thing that i've

859
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,359
seen

860
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:19,359
work pretty well as uh you know if you

861
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,278
have a sealed space you've got an air

862
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:22,798
handling unit that air handling unit on

863
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:25,839
the intake side

864
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,278
um there's a co2 sensor sometimes there

865
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:28,240
because it lets you kind of see what is

866
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:29,440
being

867
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,519
pulled in

868
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,440
to the ducting because in the ducting

869
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,599
you might have a co2

870
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,519
valve you know that that gets you know

871
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:38,959
releases co2 if a sensor says hey i need

872
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:40,319
a little bit more the valve

873
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,759
automatically opens and dumps the

874
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,079
equivalent of

875
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,759
you know 50 or 100 ppms you could have a

876
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:47,839
sensor on the back end too it just kind

877
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,119
of depends on how complex you know you

878
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:50,959
want to go and what the information that

879
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,959
you're looking for is but me personally

880
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,960
i like to see what my plants are having

881
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,319
access to so it kind of makes sense to

882
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,038
first make sure the airflow is really

883
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:00,879
good so everything is really even and

884
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,038
equalized throughout the whole room and

885
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,200
then thing number two is to put one

886
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,558
um at the canopy and see what the plants

887
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,240
have access to maybe a little bit like

888
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,079
one one third of the way down or halfway

889
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,038
down the plant okay so if somebody's

890
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,558
using those co2 bags for example it's

891
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,879
generally recommended to have it over

892
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:19,038
the plants so it'll sink down onto the

893
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,720
plants or even the tnb naturals

894
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,640
canisters for example but you're saying

895
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,120
as long as there's good air flow

896
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,720
that shouldn't be an issue yeah i think

897
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:27,599
good air flow is just going to allow you

898
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,759
to

899
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,079
take the same concentration of co2 and

900
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:34,240
spread it equally across the plant

901
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,398
because you know the

902
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,839
if co2 falls

903
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:39,119
it's you know think about it this way

904
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,278
like the top part of the plant is the

905
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,439
one that's growing most vigorously so in

906
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:45,519
reality you want to introduce that that

907
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,360
younger growth that's you know in the

908
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:48,879
presence of the sun

909
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:50,719
and taking up most of the water from the

910
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,000
roots and transpiring that that's the

911
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,399
portion of the plant that you want to

912
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,720
introduce to the most co2 or the most

913
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,959
carbon so you should kind of focus on

914
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,240
airflow a little bit um

915
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,079
but yeah i think

916
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,679
you know the ones that say you know put

917
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,199
it above the plants it'll kind of help

918
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,480
via gravity just naturally get all that

919
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,480
co2 out and once it's in that turbulent

920
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,558
stream of airflow

921
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,919
um it's going to get mixed up and it's

922
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:16,240
going to get distributed to the plants

923
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,000
pretty evenly that makes sense

924
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,679
now supplementing co2 let's say

925
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,079
hypothetically they do have a tank and

926
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,880
they really have their co2 levels dialed

927
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:28,158
in should they supplement co2 only

928
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:31,440
during lights on only during lights off

929
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,840
or both unless you're growing like cacti

930
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,278
in a desert or something like that

931
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:36,639
you don't really find a benefit from

932
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:38,880
supplementing

933
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,080
co2 at nighttime

934
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,840
tomatoes hops wine grapes anything like

935
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:46,720
lettuce broccoli

936
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:48,398
spinach kale potatoes all this stuff

937
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,159
those like to take in the power of the

938
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:52,639
sun while the sun is out and then use

939
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,000
that to convert the co2 that's out of

940
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,000
the air

941
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,440
cacti and certain other

942
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,038
plants will

943
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,558
kind of do this this thing at night time

944
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,798
it's a little bit different but their

945
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,319
metabolic daytime quote-unquote is

946
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,000
actually when the sun sets because in a

947
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:07,359
really dry and desiccating environment

948
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,679
the last thing the plants want to do is

949
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:11,278
open up the pores and allow all the

950
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,360
water to transpire there's very little

951
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,440
to begin with in the desert so they of

952
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:17,359
course like to keep their stomata closed

953
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,360
to prevent that water loss during the

954
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:20,798
day but they still kind of like solar

955
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:22,639
panels you know they they take in the

956
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:24,000
energy of the light they store that in a

957
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,120
chemical form

958
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,880
and at night time as the sun sets they

959
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,398
open up that's why a lot of cacti are

960
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,559
night blooming you know they produce

961
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:34,639
flowers at night time

962
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:36,079
but the best time to supplement co2 by

963
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,919
and large for most

964
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:39,199
crops is going to be

965
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,960
during the day

966
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,880
at night time what i've seen work really

967
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,159
well with certain types of plants is

968
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,360
they actually like a little bit of fresh

969
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,080
air you know if you have a sealed

970
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:48,079
flowering room

971
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,200
what can happen is that you know during

972
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:52,879
depending on your grow environment how

973
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,278
intense the other parameters are

974
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,840
oftentimes when the lights

975
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:59,759
turn off when the plants go to sleep

976
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:02,000
there's a little bit of co2 that's kind

977
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,440
of released you know that out that level

978
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,319
may go up a little bit part of it is

979
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,000
just the

980
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:07,839
you know the the room has changed

981
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,919
significantly lights on to lights off

982
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:11,599
changes the temperature and messes with

983
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,880
the humidity and all that stuff in the

984
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,599
plant so

985
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,640
co2 kind of revolves around all that and

986
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:18,398
uh

987
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,759
what i've personally seen is that if

988
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:21,278
you're if you're in a sealed flowering

989
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,440
room and you just do an air exchange at

990
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:27,200
nighttime to drop the co2 levels you

991
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,600
know if you were at 1500 to 1700

992
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,360
during the day then going down to maybe

993
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,959
800 to 1000 you may actually see a

994
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:34,158
benefit from

995
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,000
um

996
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,919
but yeah you're not going to find much

997
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,839
if any benefit at all from supplementing

998
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,440
at nighttime for majority of crops out

999
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:45,359
there definitely good to know okay let's

1000
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,038
get into some of the essential elements

1001
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:50,479
and how it's impacted by carbon intake i

1002
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:51,759
know you have a lot of knowledge when it

1003
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,519
comes to this i've seen some of your

1004
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,200
presentations that you have here on

1005
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,519
youtube so let's get into that let's

1006
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,919
start with nitrogen how does nitrogen

1007
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,519
impact carbon intake oh boy that's a

1008
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,679
very very complex question we can have a

1009
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,399
whole episode about that um

1010
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,519
you know i think the the most uh basic

1011
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:09,359
one

1012
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,038
the most obvious one is chlorophyll

1013
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,119
chlorophyll is a pigment that plants use

1014
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:14,480
to capture the energy of the light and

1015
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,798
they like to take that energy and they

1016
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,480
like to scrub co2 out of the air so if

1017
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:20,639
you're deficient in nitrogen

1018
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,480
chlorophyll you immediately recognize

1019
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,559
like oh hey the leaves are yellow

1020
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,000
that chlorophyll decrease means your

1021
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:27,759
plants are taking in way less light

1022
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,960
energy so you don't get as good of a

1023
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:30,640
grow

1024
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,480
uh and subsequently the biomass in the

1025
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,159
yield may also be affected by nitrogen

1026
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,399
deficiencies

1027
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,080
so it's a little bit interesting i

1028
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:39,759
always perceive the

1029
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:42,240
macronutrients and the micronutrients

1030
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:44,398
just be tools that plants use

1031
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,120
to capture more carbon or to store that

1032
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:49,038
carbon or to help transform it

1033
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:51,038
into any number of different formats

1034
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:52,720
these are all just tools like a hammer

1035
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,480
is a tool and you've got a chisel you

1036
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,679
know you've got very specific tools for

1037
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,679
very specific

1038
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,200
jobs and this is

1039
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,120
the the job that plants are trying to

1040
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,640
work on ultimately is how do i get more

1041
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,639
carbon they're like okay i'm going to

1042
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,679
take this piece of nitrogen and use it

1043
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,358
as a tool in the form of chlorophyll

1044
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,320
to power this process and take light

1045
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:14,078
energy and power the process of

1046
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,159
you know scrubbing co2 out of there the

1047
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,079
other one is an invisible enzyme rubisco

1048
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,679
it's the most abundant enzyme on the

1049
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,280
planet and rubisco as i mentioned

1050
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,358
earlier just has one job it just sucks

1051
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,280
co2 out of there and it's powered by

1052
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:26,559
chlorophyll interestingly enough that's

1053
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,000
where the energy comes from so if you're

1054
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:29,759
deficient in chlorophyll you look at

1055
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,519
your leaves they're yellow you're also

1056
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,040
deficient in the thing

1057
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:34,800
or there's not enough power coming to

1058
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:37,358
the thing that actually takes carbon out

1059
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,720
of the air so immediately by default

1060
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:41,039
when you have a nitrogen deficiency

1061
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,959
you're creating a carbon bottleneck

1062
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,480
inside of the plants when you correct

1063
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,918
that deficiency when you give them more

1064
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,280
nitrogen they say oh great thanks i'm

1065
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,199
going to turn around i'm going to use

1066
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,960
these tools

1067
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,398
to capture more

1068
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,639
carbon now you know the tools being

1069
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:57,199
chlorophyll is a pigment and then

1070
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,200
rubisco as an enzyme

1071
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:00,799
that same thing is true of magnesium you

1072
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,719
know magnesium sits at the center of

1073
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,560
chlorophyll and it also sits at the

1074
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,879
center of rubisco so if you're deficient

1075
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,559
in magnesium it's exactly the same thing

1076
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,640
you're creating a bottleneck and carbon

1077
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,480
metabolism in the plants that can't

1078
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:14,000
metabolize and so what happens in in the

1079
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,880
case of all of these deficiencies it

1080
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,358
doesn't matter if we're talking about

1081
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,640
nitrogen or phosphorus or potassium or

1082
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:20,319
calcium magnesium it doesn't matter

1083
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:22,319
which element we're talking about the

1084
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,000
first thing that happens

1085
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,359
is that the plants

1086
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,559
uh

1087
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:31,759
stop you know growing as fast you you

1088
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:33,599
find the efficiency of nutrients is also

1089
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,200
more stunted growth they don't grow as

1090
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,720
well then it grows fast they don't grow

1091
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,519
as robust they don't gain as much

1092
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:41,279
biomass they're not transpiring water as

1093
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:44,079
efficiently they're getting burned more

1094
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,320
easily and they overall just slow down

1095
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,480
and the slowdown occurs because of the

1096
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,000
bottleneck and carbon metabolism if you

1097
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,119
get all of these bottlenecks out of the

1098
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,480
way

1099
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,480
and the plants can take in as much

1100
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,400
carbon as possible whether it's co2 in a

1101
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,000
sealed room or just in the soil

1102
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,160
chemistry that's really good and healthy

1103
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,159
and dialed in the plants will grow like

1104
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:04,559
wildfire there's nothing stopping them

1105
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:06,159
these all of the power of the sun in

1106
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:07,440
real time there's nothing you know

1107
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:08,719
preventing them from growing they got

1108
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,720
enough nitrogen so they can make

1109
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:12,639
chlorophyll they have enough magnesium

1110
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:14,559
so they can power rubisco they have

1111
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,000
enough phosphorus to make those

1112
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,440
phosphate sugars that i mentioned

1113
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
earlier and this whole thing is just

1114
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,599
this balanced cycle that keeps going

1115
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,599
it's like this engine that's perfectly

1116
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,960
fine-tuned it makes you know 2000

1117
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,800
horsepower

1118
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,960
wow that's incredible moving on to

1119
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,800
phosphorus how does phosphorus impact

1120
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,400
carbon intake

1121
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,960
well phosphorus is

1122
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,200
required as an acceptor of co2 out of

1123
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,838
the air so when plants work on that co2

1124
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:40,879
that's floating around

1125
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:42,480
um well it doesn't really float around

1126
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,559
we won't get too far into that but when

1127
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,719
when plants take in that co2 and they

1128
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:48,480
need to convert it into a soluble form

1129
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:50,639
there's something that has to accept the

1130
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,480
co2 that's coming out of the air and

1131
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:54,799
into a soluble form

1132
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,119
that's where phosphorus fits in it's a

1133
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,359
it's a constituent of a sugar that

1134
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,079
accepts the co2 and often times when

1135
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:03,679
plants are deficient in phosphorus

1136
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,599
and that's that that portion

1137
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:08,159
specifically you know they they lack the

1138
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,400
ability to make those sugars and that

1139
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,000
really limits the amount of

1140
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,760
carbon metabolism that can occur and

1141
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
therefore it impacts the plants this is

1142
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,400
why phosphorus deficient plants have

1143
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,320
really stunted roots for example not as

1144
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,639
robust of a root system the architecture

1145
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,440
of the plant may also suffer not nearly

1146
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:27,118
the surface area nor the biomass

1147
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,039
because the biomass is defined by how

1148
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,200
much carbon comes into the plant and so

1149
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,199
having a limitation on phosphorus just

1150
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,358
like the nitrogen and the magnesium it

1151
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:36,960
creates a bottleneck but on the nitrogen

1152
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:39,039
and magnesium side think about it like

1153
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,320
that's the light energy side

1154
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:43,199
and that's the front end where the

1155
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,960
plants try to capture the co2 but okay

1156
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:48,719
once the light energy has been

1157
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:51,280
supplemented and once the co2 has been

1158
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:55,118
you know moved into the the functional

1159
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,119
uh spot for rubisco the catalytic spot

1160
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,640
um phosphorus is required on the back

1161
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,920
end so it's like you have a domino

1162
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:02,078
effect of

1163
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,320
how the nutrients are kind of uh

1164
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,519
required you know maybe it helps to

1165
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,760
think about it that way there's a little

1166
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:09,679
bit of time separation in terms of

1167
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,079
what's actually happening so

1168
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,960
yeah phosphorous required to absorb

1169
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,800
the co2 into the plants from the air

1170
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,800
so much good information i didn't know a

1171
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,400
lot of that so i'm sure this is gonna be

1172
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,320
an episode where i just rewatch it and

1173
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,200
just like take notes and stuff like that

1174
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,480
yeah and i'm sure there's a lot of

1175
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:26,719
people tuning in right now that are

1176
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,039
taking notes so it's hard to absorb it

1177
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:30,799
all within the matter of uh one lesson

1178
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,119
here i'm sure

1179
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,760
let's move on to potassium how does

1180
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,200
potassium impact carbon intake

1181
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,680
well potassium is like the grand

1182
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:42,078
orchestrator of carbon metabolism um

1183
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:43,519
there's a lot of enzymes that enzymes

1184
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,200
are just like tools or like workers you

1185
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:46,960
know they take a substrate just like a

1186
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,559
woodworker takes a raw

1187
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,240
block of wood and he may turn it into a

1188
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,759
beautiful ornate carving or something

1189
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:53,838
more functional like actually has

1190
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,839
physical function maybe it's lockbox or

1191
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:57,199
a breadbox or something like that but

1192
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:58,960
enzymes are kind of the same way they

1193
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:01,358
take these raw blocks of substrate these

1194
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,119
building blocks and they kind of convert

1195
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:04,960
them and shape them into a variety of

1196
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,039
different things so a lot of enzymes

1197
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,519
will act on carbon you know the enzymes

1198
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:11,679
associated with sugar metabolism

1199
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:13,358
and with responses to you know plant

1200
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:15,358
stressors for example if there's like a

1201
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:17,119
bug that's biting into your your leaf

1202
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:19,039
tissue you know the plants will

1203
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,880
they have these switches that they turn

1204
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:23,039
on and off and these switches

1205
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,000
are mediated by potassium so when you

1206
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:25,838
have

1207
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,599
potassium

1208
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:29,279
you know fairly high levels of potassium

1209
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,760
in the plant what what you find is that

1210
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,640
the plants have the ability they have

1211
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,440
the

1212
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,960
um

1213
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,880
you know the ability to turn on those

1214
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,880
switches that regulate carbon metabolism

1215
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,519
one of the other interesting ways that

1216
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,720
potassium interacts with carbon is that

1217
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:48,559
it actually serves to store some carbon

1218
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:50,559
a large pools of carbon that are kind of

1219
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,159
like transitionary pools of carbon you

1220
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:53,119
know think about it like when plants

1221
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:54,719
take in

1222
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,039
carbon that carbon doesn't get

1223
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:58,639
metabolized and moved to its end spot

1224
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:59,759
immediately that n spot could be

1225
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:01,598
something like

1226
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,520
um you know the compounds that are

1227
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,200
produced inside of hops those really

1228
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:07,519
highly aromatic

1229
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:10,559
alpha acids those are an example of

1230
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:12,159
what's called a sort of a metabolite you

1231
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,318
know that carbon has been moved down a

1232
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:16,239
pathway and that terminal final step

1233
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:18,318
where it's finally all said and done is

1234
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:20,078
with the production of that

1235
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:21,920
compound you know oftentimes it could be

1236
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,760
terpenes like in tomatoes for example

1237
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,358
you know they produce a lot of terpenes

1238
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,960
and so do other crops like lavender for

1239
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:29,119
example produces a lot of terpenes that

1240
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,679
are all very therapeutic and stuff but

1241
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,280
they move carbon from co2 which is the

1242
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,078
origin point

1243
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,160
down a very complex and very long line

1244
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,920
and series of different steps with

1245
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:41,358
enzymes all of which potassium turns on

1246
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,119
and says okay take this carbon do that

1247
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:45,199
with the pop-up they just go around and

1248
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,800
they do a bunch of things terminal

1249
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:48,239
metabolites are ones that the plants

1250
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,000
like okay i'm done metabolizing the

1251
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:52,799
carbon i'm going to sink the carbon i'm

1252
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,559
going to put it into this form there's

1253
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,079
the more important forms of carbon the

1254
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,838
ones that potassium can directly

1255
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,800
interact with

1256
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:00,880
are the ones that are in that

1257
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,160
transitionary state they have been taken

1258
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,079
in by the plant but they haven't been

1259
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:05,920
moved yet all the way through the system

1260
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,440
and these pools of carbon plants when

1261
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,880
they accumulate them they actually

1262
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,559
accumulate energy inside of their

1263
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,880
systems so if you have a lot of

1264
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,639
potassium you can actually sink a lot of

1265
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,200
carbon inside of your plants and that

1266
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:19,358
carbon is specifically in the form of

1267
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:22,000
organic acids you know it's been shown

1268
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:24,239
for example that as plants take in the

1269
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,480
light energy they power this process of

1270
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:28,559
converting carbon into a soluble form

1271
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,400
once that carbon is in a soluble form it

1272
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:34,559
finds its way to a potassium uh ion

1273
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,240
and those are basically neutralized with

1274
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,759
each other they're highly soluble

1275
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:39,759
they're perfectly balanced in terms of

1276
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,160
their charge and their functional sort

1277
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,160
uh you know sources of carbon for the

1278
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:45,679
plant and also more potassium in case

1279
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:47,838
one of these enzymes needs an on off

1280
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,440
switch or something like that you know

1281
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,599
so getting more potassium into your

1282
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,519
plants allows you to physically and

1283
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,599
chemically stuff more carbon inside of

1284
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:56,960
your plants if you don't have let's say

1285
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,400
you have a sealed flowering room and

1286
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:03,199
you've got co2 supplementation

1287
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,200
if if you are deficient in potassium

1288
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:06,480
it's a much smaller amount of carbon

1289
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:08,159
that you can fit into your plants you

1290
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,679
may find that the upper limit or the

1291
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:12,879
upper benefit is 500 to 600 ppms of

1292
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:14,559
carbon when you're deficient in

1293
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,400
potassium but at the moment you get that

1294
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:19,279
potassium level up let's say you double

1295
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,039
your potassium to like 250 to 300 ppms

1296
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,040
of potassium all of a sudden the

1297
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,719
appetite that the plants have for carbon

1298
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:26,960
goes way up in the maximum amount that

1299
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:28,399
you can find a benefit from goes through

1300
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,159
the roof because inside of the plants

1301
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,760
the potassium and the carbon have to

1302
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:34,078
meet and say okay this is the middle

1303
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,880
neutral state any excess carbon because

1304
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,560
of the deficiency of potassium just gets

1305
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,960
relieved you know that's part of the

1306
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:42,400
reason that the co2 levels at night time

1307
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,079
could rise in a plant is because that

1308
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,160
charge balance isn't being maintained so

1309
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,519
they release the co2 they can't they

1310
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:49,759
physically have no

1311
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,280
you know ability to deal with it that's

1312
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,480
super interesting and when you're

1313
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,800
talking about specific ppms of you know

1314
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,960
potassium for example or really specific

1315
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,400
ppms of anything

1316
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,240
it's more for

1317
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,720
hydroponic systems where you have a

1318
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:08,239
control right as far as you can actually

1319
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:09,759
measure out and precision feed these

1320
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:11,358
plants right is that kind of what you're

1321
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,359
mentioning when you talk about specific

1322
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:14,639
ppms yeah yeah i would say that it's

1323
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:16,239
it's definitely applicable to the

1324
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:17,920
controlled environment guys but i also

1325
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:20,239
think that

1326
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,599
for standard or conventional agriculture

1327
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:23,919
it makes sense to try to think about

1328
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,519
things in ratios rather than quantities

1329
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,119
or amounts which is a little bit

1330
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,880
different you know traditional

1331
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,400
agriculture i think is still kind of

1332
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,920
rooted in like okay how many pounds per

1333
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,318
acre do we apply and what are the

1334
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,000
individual things that we're looking for

1335
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:37,358
whereas the more you know advanced

1336
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,119
approaches to agriculture are now

1337
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:41,358
looking at things in terms of nutrient

1338
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,880
composition ratios to one another how

1339
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:46,078
many parts in a million do you want as

1340
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,160
opposed to how many pounds per acre

1341
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,560
and this all takes into account like the

1342
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:52,480
use efficiency of nutrients plus

1343
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:54,400
the use efficiency of water because

1344
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,599
we're kind of getting to a spot globally

1345
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,760
speaking where

1346
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,800
it's very important to consider

1347
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,160
you know the

1348
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,240
the efficiency of both of these

1349
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:04,879
compounds there's not unlimited supplies

1350
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:06,879
of phosphorus that are easily accessible

1351
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,039
um and then same thing for fresh water

1352
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,200
it is actually a very valuable resource

1353
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:12,800
in some areas that have to deal with dry

1354
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:14,399
conditions or arid conditions they may

1355
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,720
not have access to as much water that

1356
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,960
they did the year before so you know all

1357
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:20,719
things considered in a global

1358
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,318
climate that's sort of you know

1359
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:24,639
constantly changing and actively

1360
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:26,960
presenting challenges for farmers one of

1361
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:29,039
the ways to address those challenges is

1362
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,559
to be very mindful about how efficient

1363
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,960
you're using the water

1364
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:34,559
um and mindful about how you're using

1365
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,920
each nutrient down to the nearest part

1366
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:37,440
per million i mean that's really the

1367
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,639
best way to go so

1368
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,838
gotcha let's move on to calcium how does

1369
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:45,920
calcium impact carbon intake

1370
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:47,759
well calcium is a very interesting

1371
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,519
element it uh

1372
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,960
it helps regulate you know circadian

1373
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:53,280
rhythms inside of plants sugar

1374
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,199
metabolism inside of plants one of the

1375
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,800
most direct pathways is when the plants

1376
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:58,719
take up calcium they use it as a

1377
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,440
building block in their cell wall you

1378
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:04,799
know just like humans use lime to make

1379
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,119
structures lime is calcium basically and

1380
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,720
it makes basically cement inside of the

1381
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,039
cell walls of plants and so what they

1382
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:13,439
have to do partially is take an energy

1383
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,279
from the sun and power that whole carbon

1384
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,119
fixation process but once the carbon

1385
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,040
arrives at a particular state you know

1386
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,160
potassium has turned on a switch to make

1387
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:24,480
this enzyme active this enzyme

1388
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:27,358
may be associated with pectic acid

1389
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,400
biosynthesis pectic acid is kind of like

1390
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:32,960
the glue or that little um it's almost

1391
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:36,400
like the cement of the walls and there's

1392
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,760
there's enzymes that will take calcium

1393
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,559
and combine it with

1394
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,599
pectic acid to make calcium pectate

1395
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:43,599
which is a

1396
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,039
pretty important building block for

1397
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,359
plants in their cell walls and the more

1398
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:49,279
you can get calcium into the cell walls

1399
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:50,960
of plants the better overall their

1400
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,359
ability to resist

1401
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,599
uh you know disease pressures to resist

1402
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:58,000
changes in the environment

1403
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,599
light intensity things of that nature

1404
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,559
generally speaking calcium is required

1405
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,240
in very large amounts for the plants

1406
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,838
and it's also one of those elements that

1407
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:07,679
if you figure out how to get it

1408
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:10,480
metabolized properly and get it to grow

1409
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:12,399
inside of your kale or your broccoli in

1410
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,079
particular you're going to find that the

1411
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,519
nutrient density of those food crops

1412
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,280
goes through the roof because you have

1413
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:19,280
more calcium inside of there right you

1414
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,720
want more of the calcium to be present

1415
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,319
inside of the crop so you can take it

1416
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:24,879
you can eat it and then you get more of

1417
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:26,838
a benefit well the best way to do that

1418
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,880
for the plants at least from the plants

1419
00:46:26,838 --> 00:46:30,159
perspective is to have more of those

1420
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,838
stored pools of carbon that i was

1421
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:34,000
talking about those ones that haven't

1422
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:35,440
quite been made into you know the pectic

1423
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,280
acid that's going to get combined with

1424
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,960
the calcium and then shoved into a cell

1425
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,800
wall right once it's there it's a little

1426
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,159
more difficult for the plants to break

1427
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,000
it down and repurpose it they actually

1428
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:45,039
have to spend a lot more energy than

1429
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,280
it's worth

1430
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:49,358
that's why calcium deficiencies you know

1431
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,040
will show themselves in the newest

1432
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:53,838
growth of the plant because you need

1433
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:56,000
this constant supply of calcium

1434
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:57,838
to be present to the plants in the

1435
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,838
transpiration stream in order for them

1436
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:02,318
to be able to take that calcium make the

1437
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:04,078
cell walls really thick really robust

1438
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:05,599
you know able to resist light intensity

1439
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,599
that's maybe a little bit too much for

1440
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,200
such young and thin and sensitive tissue

1441
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,359
and do all that stuff and then as the

1442
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:13,118
plant continues to grow

1443
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:15,838
you know it again needs this constant

1444
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,519
supply of calcium in there so cell walls

1445
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:19,039
are a really really important

1446
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:20,800
function of calcium and carbon

1447
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,960
metabolism and how the two come together

1448
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,960
to

1449
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:28,159
you know ultimately

1450
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:30,078
uh sink both of those into the plant

1451
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:32,159
the other you know calcium is not only a

1452
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,240
structural element but it's also a

1453
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:36,639
functional element in the sense that the

1454
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:38,479
way calcium works inside of plants is

1455
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:40,719
much like how neurons work inside of the

1456
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,318
human brain there's this firing that's

1457
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:44,558
going on this communication between

1458
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:46,159
neurons to help build this picture that

1459
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,760
the brain has or this understanding or

1460
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:48,960
perception of

1461
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,960
reality

1462
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,039
plants are actually interestingly enough

1463
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,159
very very similar they use calcium in

1464
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:56,400
similar ways

1465
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:58,799
ways there's these waves that actually

1466
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,039
get propagated these calcium waves

1467
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,640
that spread information across every

1468
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:04,719
cell of the plant and so if you look at

1469
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:06,239
when plants respond to like a mechanical

1470
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:08,480
stressor let's say you take a pair of

1471
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:10,000
garden shears and it's time to give your

1472
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,079
you know plants a haircut or maybe you

1473
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,079
just want to trim them up a little bit

1474
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,680
as soon as you

1475
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,318
you know cut the plants

1476
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:20,000
uh there's this calcium signaling event

1477
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:22,800
that happens within the plants there's

1478
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,519
this propagation of calcium

1479
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,839
waves that fire off each other inside of

1480
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:29,599
a plant and help spread this message and

1481
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:31,039
in certain cases it could be a localized

1482
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,318
response like if there's a disease

1483
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:34,000
pressure that's trying to come in maybe

1484
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:35,838
it's like a fungal predator that's

1485
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,440
trying to break in those calcium waves

1486
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:39,199
will help spread information to the rest

1487
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,159
of the plant and make the plant aware

1488
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:42,239
that there's

1489
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:44,239
uh you know a danger there's some kind

1490
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,318
of threat and so the whole plant

1491
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:48,239
responds to what is actually

1492
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:49,519
originating from a very localized place

1493
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:51,439
in the plant it's a very very small

1494
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,519
surface area that the fungi that the

1495
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,119
insect is biting into

1496
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:56,800
but somehow the message gets spread

1497
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,599
across the whole plant and the whole

1498
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:02,079
plant responds and that is a function of

1499
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,599
calcium as not only you know structural

1500
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,079
piece in the cell walls but also an

1501
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,318
electrochemical functional thing like

1502
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,640
neurons in the human brain okay and then

1503
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:12,639
i imagine magnesium there's some

1504
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:14,719
similarities there i mean you hear about

1505
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:16,000
calcium and magnesium being paired up on

1506
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:17,838
things i'm sure there's a lot of

1507
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,400
differences too but uh can you talk to

1508
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:22,799
us about magnesium how does magnesium

1509
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,800
impact carbon intake

1510
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,079
yeah magnesium um

1511
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,599
you know when plants are taking in the

1512
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,800
energy of

1513
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,318
the light really what they're trying to

1514
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,680
do is uh convert that to chemical energy

1515
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:35,199
because the chemical energy is the one

1516
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,318
that plants use to power all the stuff

1517
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:37,598
that we've been talking about you know

1518
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:39,599
chlorophyll

1519
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,280
um rubisco

1520
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,960
uh even the phosphate sugars that

1521
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,519
requires chemical energy for the plants

1522
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,880
to you know recycle all of them like

1523
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:48,800
they do with a lot of these these are

1524
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,880
just cyclical

1525
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,720
or even generate new

1526
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,440
you know new molecules that are similar

1527
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:58,078
new chlorophyll new rubisco this stuff

1528
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,760
requires energy

1529
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,760
in the in the process of converting

1530
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,319
light energy into chemical energy

1531
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,640
magnesium is actually the thing that

1532
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:09,599
uh plants you know rely on in order to

1533
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:12,318
make a molecule called atp and atp

1534
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,880
is a very high energy molecule that is

1535
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:16,800
ultimately created when plants you know

1536
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,599
facilitate this process of converting

1537
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,119
sun

1538
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,640
light energy

1539
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:23,119
into chemical energy that chemical

1540
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:24,960
energy is actually atp in part there are

1541
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,640
other molecules but atp is like the

1542
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,639
really really valuable ones very high

1543
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:30,799
energy well it turns out that it's not

1544
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:32,078
atp actually like a lot of people have

1545
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,440
heard and maybe assume it to be it's

1546
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:37,280
actually magnesium atp magnesium is the

1547
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,318
carrier it's the chelating agent for it

1548
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,079
and it helps bind up the atp and allow

1549
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:43,039
it to be transported to where it needs

1550
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,800
to go

1551
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:46,480
and so if you have a deficiency in

1552
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,559
magnesium

1553
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,519
you have this bottleneck in terms of the

1554
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,960
atp that can be made and atp is like i

1555
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,199
mean it's like you know having us

1556
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,800
dollars versus having ounces of gold i

1557
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:59,118
would much rather take the ounces of

1558
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,720
gold you know that's something that the

1559
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,800
value difference is quite dramatic

1560
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:04,318
between more basic forms of chemical

1561
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,400
currency or chemical energy for the

1562
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:08,880
plants and really the holy grail which

1563
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,119
is atp if you look at all of these

1564
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,800
energy producing systems inside of

1565
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,119
biological systems

1566
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,039
like humans for example we breathe in

1567
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:19,920
oxygen and that drives what's called

1568
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:20,800
oxidative phosphorylation we make atp

1569
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,800
using

1570
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,800
the power of oxygen you know and we also

1571
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,200
break down matter that plants produce

1572
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,960
but plants also similarly taken energy

1573
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:32,399
from the light and they use that to make

1574
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,920
atp so universally across all species it

1575
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,680
doesn't matter if you're you know a

1576
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,720
plant or if you're a human

1577
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:40,318
atp for your entire biological system is

1578
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:42,159
one of the most valuable if not the most

1579
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:44,318
valuable valuable

1580
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:46,318
energy currency there is and having a

1581
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:47,838
deficiency in magnesium

1582
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:50,318
uh ultimately means you have a

1583
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:52,400
deficiency in atp because it's magnesium

1584
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:54,880
atp that is actually the energetic

1585
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,318
molecule it's not just atp lots of good

1586
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,318
information there well we don't have

1587
00:51:56,318 --> 00:52:01,119
time to go over every single essential

1588
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:02,960
element and how it's impacted by carbon

1589
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,599
intake maybe we'll save that for a part

1590
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,960
two i don't know but if the audience

1591
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,720
demands it yeah we could probably get

1592
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,119
him on for part two in the future i'm

1593
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:12,318
sure yeah that'd be fun

1594
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:14,200
now a lot of things that you talked

1595
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:16,239
about for clarification purposes is

1596
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:18,879
biochemistry right

1597
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:21,199
now i'm myself i'm just learning regular

1598
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,800
chemistry would you say that chemistry

1599
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:25,118
is kind of a prerequisite you should

1600
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,240
learn that first before biochemistry and

1601
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,160
then also do you have any other

1602
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:30,000
resources like people who want to learn

1603
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:30,838
more about biochemistry where they

1604
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,400
should

1605
00:52:30,838 --> 00:52:34,558
go

1606
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:37,039
yeah i mean you know from my perspective

1607
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:39,599
i think the best way to learn is to

1608
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:41,759
it's a very simple process actually

1609
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,318
just read something about plants that is

1610
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,000
interesting for you and i i prefer to go

1611
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:47,519
to the journal of experimental botany

1612
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,440
that oxford has because there's always

1613
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:50,960
good topics you can look back through

1614
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,119
the years they have a number of

1615
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,720
different uh topics that they've covered

1616
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,240
but you know the the thing about the

1617
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:57,519
learning process with this stuff is it

1618
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:59,838
gets really complex and there's

1619
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:01,199
oftentimes a lot of wormholes and

1620
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:02,799
there's even lingo sometimes that

1621
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:05,519
doesn't make sense like reduction in

1622
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,559
oxidation it can be very confusing for

1623
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:08,800
people

1624
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,800
and so really depends on how you frame

1625
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,318
your interest and what your passion is

1626
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,160
so i find

1627
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:16,000
that this is easy to do if you go and

1628
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:17,598
read just one paper a day

1629
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,159
and find one topic that's interesting

1630
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:22,240
maybe you're curious about how plants

1631
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:24,078
turn sugars into things like you know

1632
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:26,159
terpenes inside of lavender how does

1633
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:28,480
that wonderful fragrance get produced by

1634
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:31,039
the plants you know read a paper about

1635
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,079
it and then find ask at least one

1636
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:34,159
question

1637
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,519
that arose when you read that paper ask

1638
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:37,118
one question to yourself what would i

1639
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:39,039
want to learn more about what what was

1640
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,640
confusing or what didn't make sense and

1641
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:42,239
if you just go through that same process

1642
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:44,480
over and over and over again you'll

1643
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:46,399
eventually get to a spot where you

1644
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,639
have a much deeper understanding of you

1645
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,639
know plant physiology not only the the

1646
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:52,719
chemistry of it all but also the

1647
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:54,799
biochemistry the organic chemistry

1648
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:56,399
carbon chemistry side associated because

1649
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,640
that's really the pandora's box once you

1650
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,318
open that up it's the inside is now the

1651
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:02,400
outside so you can no longer close it

1652
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:03,759
