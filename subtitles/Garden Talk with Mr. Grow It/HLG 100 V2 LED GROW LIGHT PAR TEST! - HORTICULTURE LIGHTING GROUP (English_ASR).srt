1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,539
what's up everybody feel that don't know

2
00:00:01,318 --> 00:00:05,459
me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,849
you're watching my extra channel here I

4
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:11,160
have the hlg 100 v2 LED grow light this

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:14,669
is a 3000 K color temperature

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,100
this unit has LM 301 B diodes and I'm

7
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:19,198
going to be doing a part test today for

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,140
this test I'm going to use the apogee MQ

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,630
500 power meter this meter measures a

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,199
certain range it measures from 389 90

11
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:31,229
meters to 692 nanometers plus or minus 5

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,579
nanometers measurements are in two ppfd

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,289
and this is just gonna give you a

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,210
general idea of what the power output is

15
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:39,689
for this grow light it's not meant to be

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,700
a 100% accurate test it's in a grow tent

17
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:43,589
so the reflective walls could throw

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,320
things off a bit and I have the grow

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,300
tent open so one side isn't even getting

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,640
the reflective walls but again this is

21
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,769
just for to give you guys a general idea

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,239
of what the power measurements are this

23
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,550
girl light has a flowering coverage area

24
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,429
of a two foot by two foot and this grow

25
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:01,078
10 is a 2 foot by 4 foot so I'm going to

26
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:02,549
keep the power meter on one side of the

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,519
tent I'm going to do three different

28
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:07,829
distances 12 inches away 18 inches away

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,450
and then 24 inches away just like all

30
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:11,299
the other power videos I will let the

31
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:17,829
measurements do the talking

32
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:17,829

34
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,079
what do you think of these measurements

35
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:26,590
let me know in the comment section below

36
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:29,200
I still have four potentially five more

37
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,878
part test videos coming at you those

38
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,139
will be released in the upcoming weeks

39
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,489
that's pretty much it for this video

40
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:35,108
guys if you enjoyed it please click that

41
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:37,420
thumbs up and I will leave that that

42
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:39,780
thank you so much for watching and until

43
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:56,149
next time peace
