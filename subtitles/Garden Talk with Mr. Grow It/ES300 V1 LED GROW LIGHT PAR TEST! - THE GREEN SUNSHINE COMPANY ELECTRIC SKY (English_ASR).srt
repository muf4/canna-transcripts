00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,719
what's up everybody feed that don't know

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:05,459
me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,710
you're watching my extras channel this

4
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:09,719
is the es 300 LED grow light by the

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,210
green sunshine company it's also called

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:14,160
the electric sky 300 and in this video

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,528
I'm going to test the power output I'm

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,769
going to use the Apple gmq 500 power

9
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:22,740
meter and this meter measures from 389

10
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:25,079
nanometers to 692 nanometers plus or

11
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:27,419
minus 5 nanometers measurements are in

12
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:30,959
ppfd just to give you a heads up but

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,090
this unit has about 10% IR which does

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,219
not show up on this meter so just keep

15
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,809
that in mind that the actual power

16
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,390
output is going to be a little bit

17
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:40,619
higher than what the meter shows and

18
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,239
this is just going to give you a general

19
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,369
idea of what the power output is it's

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,229
not gonna be under percent accurate this

21
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:47,878
is being measured in a grow tent which

22
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:49,558
has reflective walls so that could

23
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:51,299
increase the part numbers so just keep

24
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:53,519
that in mind this unit has a flowering

25
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:55,709
coverage area of 2 foot by 4 foot and

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,210
the tent I'm measuring it in is a 2 foot

27
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,280
by 4 foot I'm going to take measurements

28
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,890
at 18 inches away which is the

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,650
manufacturers recommendation 24 inches

30
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,030
away and then 36 inches away just like

31
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,469
all the other parts has videos that I

32
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,730
have on this channel I'll let the

33
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:34,019
measurements do the talking

34
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:34,019

39
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,990
just a quick note this is the first

40
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:31,320
version of this grow light they now have

41
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:34,140
a v2 of version 2 of this light the es

42
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,969
300 v2 does have different diodes and a

43
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,289
different power output I'll leave a link

44
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:39,210
to this light in the description section

45
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:40,650
below so you can learn more what do you

46
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,270
think of these measurements let me know

47
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,039
in the comment section below and I will

48
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,800
leave at that thank you so much for

49
00:03:44,039 --> 00:04:03,008
watching and until next time peace
