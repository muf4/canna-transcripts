and in this video i'm going to unbox the

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,359
unit i'll test the power output

8
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,559
and also do a heat test on it i'm not

9
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:17,439
going to talk about all of the grow

10
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,439

i'll leave that in the description

17
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,879
section as well okay first thing out the

18
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,959
box

19
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,320
is this cable this cable is used for

20
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,359
multi-light connection

21
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,320
you can connect up to 12 lights next

22
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,079
thing out the box

23
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,719
is the user manual they've included

24
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,719
two rope ratchet hangers and some wire

25
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,160
hangers are also in this bag

26
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,840
the power cord is connected to the

27
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,359
fixture and here is the fixture

28
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,440
for the par test i'm going to use the

29
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,359
apogee mq620

30
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,519
extended range part meter this meter

31
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,600
measures from 340 nanometers

32
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,719
to 1040 nanometers and the measurements

33
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,239
are in ppfd

34
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,320
if this your first time watching my pod

35
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,319
test videos i do them just to give you a

36
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,399
general idea of what the power output is

37
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,239
they're not meant to be 100 accurate i

38
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,280
take measurements in grow tents which

39
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,118
have reflective walls

40
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,960
that could increase the numbers so just

41
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,239
keep that in mind the flowering coverage

42
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,319
area for this grow light is

43
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,319
two feet by four feet and i'm taking

44
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,199
measurements in a two foot by four foot

45
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,039
grow tent

46
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,040
this light does have a dimmer on it for

47
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,280
the part test i'll set it to one hundred

48
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,560
percent i've plugged the led grow light

49
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,840
into my kilowatt meter

50
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,879
and it shows 1.72 amps pulling

51
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,880
203 watts alright let's get into the

52
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
measurements
