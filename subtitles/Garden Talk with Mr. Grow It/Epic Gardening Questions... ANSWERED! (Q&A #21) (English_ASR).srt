1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,519
at what week of flower do you pollinate

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:08,939
your females for best seed results so I

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,619
learned from sub cool around day 28 is

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:13,018
what he had mentioned and I've just been

5
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:16,500
doing that really anywhere between day

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,600
20 to 35 is a rough range where people

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,460
like to another thing that people say is

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,560
that only ate the plant when it looks

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,839
horny when you see those uh those

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,459
pistols stigmas they're really bursting

11
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:28,559
up from all directions that's when you

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,660
hit it with the pollination so but

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,098
usually it's around day 28 is when I'm

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,539
going in there and pollinating the

15
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,398
female plants and then of course I'm

16
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,039
just letting that plant grow and grow

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,280
and grow all the way up as far as I can

18
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:43,500
because uh really I'm not harvesting for

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,439
flour so oftentimes they're going past

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,600
the Harvest window so I can get more

21
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,738
seed development out of it there have

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,300
been some plants where it just looks

23
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:52,558
cannibalized towards the end there

24
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:55,378
because I'm just pushing it to try to

25
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,820
get more seeds out of it and seeds will

26
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:58,439
be dropping for sure you know when you

27
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,939
push them plate that long that's been

28
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:03,358
pollinated seeds start dropping off of

29
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:05,640
the evil diode man I really like the Evo

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,040
diode I mean it's Samsung's newest

31
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,060
release right for diode so the lm301h

32
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,618
Evo diode 3.14 micro moles per Joule so

33
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,900
that's awesome I know there's some

34
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:17,519
companies that have included them in

35
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,560
their fixtures I did want to mention

36
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,840
that Mars Hydro actually is including

37
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,859
them now in their FC series big shout

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,280
out to Mars how to they're actually

39
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:29,299
sponsoring this q a video so the FC 3000

40
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:34,920
Evo they've got the FC 8000

41
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:38,219
fc1000w FC 6500 and fc4800 all have the

42
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,840
Evo diodes from Samsung in there and

43
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,959
they're actually doing a sale right now

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,020
14 off all of the items on their website

45
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:48,478
so um actually use coupon code Mr row it

46
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:51,060
use my coupon code Mr Grow it helps me

47
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,219
gives me some some credit there and the

48
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,700
sale is running from the 14th to the

49
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,920
27th so I want to jump on it now and uh

50
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,840
save some moolah I'll have a link in the

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,700
description section below what do you do

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,399
when you get clawing and toxicity and

53
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,899
organic living soil grow I think that's

54
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,780
a really good question what I normally

55
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:12,120
do is just continue to water in I don't

56
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,219
do any type of flushing I haven't been

57
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,319
in a situation where I needed to but I

58
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:18,780
felt like I needed to flush an organic

59
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,399
soil right soil with just organic

60
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,620
amendments in there I've just been kind

61
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,719
of doing watering and then letting the

62
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,640
plant kind of work itself out of it you

63
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,080
know if I need to keep a plant in the

64
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,059
vegetation stage a little bit longer

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,340
then that's what I do before flipping

66
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,560
the flour but yeah I have got come

67
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:39,239
across that where you get some a little

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:42,239
bit darker of leaves shiny clawing clear

69
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,099
sign of nitrogen toxicity and uh yeah I

70
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,200
just continue to kind of just feed plain

71
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:47,818
water only and then eventually that

72
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,979
plant kind of bounces out of it right it

73
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:51,598
depletes the nutrients within the medium

74
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:54,179
the Amendments have you know broken down

75
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,219
plants of uptaking those nutrients and

76
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,560
you start to see it kind of bounce back

77
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:00,359
and be fine from there so that's what

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,819
I've done I know there are other Rose

79
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,980
out there who just they flush they go

80
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:06,958
right to Flushing they go and run a ton

81
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:08,878
of water through the medium in order to

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,878
flush out and kind of start back from

83
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,679
scratch but I personally haven't done

84
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:16,139
that what are your thoughts on 1212 from

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,659
C never heard much about it I've done it

86
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:21,598
so I've done it a couple different times

87
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:23,519
I've done it in a Solo Cup and uh one

88
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,318
thing to know about 12 12 that I think a

89
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,140
lot of people have misconceptions on is

90
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:30,539
if you are planting a seed seed Sprouts

91
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:33,479
on the medium right day one it's getting

92
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:35,400
12 12 light cycle it's still gonna spend

93
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,959
some time in the vegetation stage it's

94
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,060
not going to go right to shooting on

95
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,158
pistols and start flowering and have

96
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,640
barely any growth right it's gonna spend

97
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:46,318
the first 20-ish days in the veg stage

98
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,479
before you start seeing pistol I believe

99
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,399
it was 21 days is when I first started

100
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,560
seeing pistols on a plant that I just

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,260
gave 12 12 right off the bat so you get

102
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,299
some veg period then of course it starts

103
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:58,798
to flower so yeah you can totally do

104
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,540
that some people do that in order to

105
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,060
save on energy consumption and so people

106
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:04,798
do that on the sog technique sea of

107
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,598
green so if they're just doing that one

108
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,819
Cola coming up but a bunch of different

109
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:11,518
plants they'll just hit it with a FL 12

110
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:14,039
12 right off the bat it'll grow up you

111
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,199
know 8 10 12 inches so just keep that

112
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:17,339
one Cola and then it'll start flowering

113
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,160
and then they'll have a whole bunch of

114
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,899
just single Cola SOG technique so

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,600
there's a couple different reasons for

116
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,698
why you would potentially do it I've

117
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,100
just been sticking with the 18 6 for the

118
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,360
veg and then 12 12 for flour because I

119
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,460
do like to have that control over the

120
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,160
veg period I mean veg the plants for as

121
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:36,719
long as I want to get the plant shaped

122
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,300
the way I want to then kind of flip it

123
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,580
to flower but uh yeah 12 12. that is

124
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,079
definitely a thing that people do for a

125
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:45,060
couple different reasons can you please

126
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:47,758
explain what power should be run at seed

127
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,959
veg and flour and the height this is all

128
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,800
dependent on what grow light you're

129
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:55,620
using so grow lights are all not created

130
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,060
equal there's some folks that have a

131
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,978
grow light where they're dimming it down

132
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,620
and they're getting super close to their

133
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:03,360
plants other folks are putting on a full

134
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,100
blast having the light all the way up at

135
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,720
the top of the tent and then just

136
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,400
keeping on that setting the entire time

137
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,720
and then the plant kind of grow into it

138
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,459
a couple different ways you can go about

139
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,139
it some people are going to say that hey

140
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:15,060
if you're keeping a full blast all the

141
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,560
time especially with just seedlings

142
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,780
you're wasting energy so Some people

143
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,540
prefer to kind of bring it down and then

144
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:25,198
dim it down but it's really impossible

145
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,600
to give you an a blanket answer on what

146
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,580
power should be run at the seed veg and

147
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,800
flower cycle a different way to go about

148
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:35,459
it would be DLI a lot of people go after

149
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,280
in between 40 and 60 DLI so if you're

150
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:39,478
tracking DLI that is said to be kind of

151
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:41,519
one of the more accurate ways in

152
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:43,258
determining how much light your plant

153
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,959
should get on a daily basis the other

154
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:48,060
thing would be par let people look at

155
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:49,739
the ppfd numbers they have a par meter

156
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,939
and they'll look if you do have a

157
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,340
parameter although they are very

158
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:56,219
expensive it can be useful I have one

159
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:58,379
I'm looking at giving 200 to 400 ppfd in

160
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,419
seedling or clones even mother plants

161
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:02,879
I'm just going to keep them growing slow

162
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:04,859
400 to 600 ppfd for plants on the

163
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,560
vegetation stage and then 600 to 900

164
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,360
ppfd in the flowering stage if

165
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,819
supplementing CO2 a lot of people going

166
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,620
a little bit higher than that so um so

167
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,240
yeah that's kind of the best answer I

168
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,038
can give you for for that question it's

169
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,740
really dependent on what grow light

170
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:22,918
you're using on what power you can put

171
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,780
it at what height you can put it at for

172
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:27,120
the different stages of growth it's my

173
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:28,978
first harvest I've dried some larf and

174
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,139
then some of it comes out smelling

175
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:35,038
really good and some of it smells like a

176
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:37,199
plant or in 65 temp 60 humidity so my

177
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,579
actual question is when you hang dry how

178
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,919
long does it take for the plant to smell

179
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:42,719
to go away it's it'll take a little bit

180
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:45,779
right yeah that fresh plant Harvest

181
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,060
smell that you get certainly you can

182
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,339
have that in the drying phase for sure

183
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,459
once you get into curing so once you've

184
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:54,839
you've dried for in between four and ten

185
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:57,299
days some people are longer than that

186
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,818
actually uh I'm planning a video talking

187
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,379
about drying and curing with some a

188
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,840
bunch of studies that have been come out

189
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:06,120
pretty recently here but ideal drying

190
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,698
time according to latest studies is

191
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,819
anywhere between four and I think it's

192
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:15,180
12 days of drying if you go longer if

193
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:19,259
you do an extended dry micro growth is a

194
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:21,538
concern but uh 6560 that should be fine

195
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,220
and you'll see once you get into curing

196
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:25,680
and you start burping those jars and

197
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,960
having that off gas thing happen within

198
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,300
the matter of weeks you'll see the true

199
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:32,698
smell start to come out from there I

200
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,379
have taken cuts for the first time 14

201
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,360
days ago on Wednesday I have some that

202
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:38,519
rooted bothers that have not in your

203
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,800
opinion how long should I let the ones

204
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:43,019
that have not rooted ride in the dome

205
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,500
and what should I do about the ones that

206
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:48,060
don't take thanks good question I am

207
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,279
assuming that you're going straight into

208
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,379
the medium so maybe you're cutting a

209
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:54,899
clone and putting directly into soil or

210
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:56,579
directly into cocoa and then assume

211
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:58,138
that's kind of what you're using since

212
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:00,300
you didn't mention any other type of

213
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:03,060
method I've been through that same exact

214
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,680
bang to where I've got cloned put them

215
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,339
in the soil and then they didn't take

216
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:11,038
root one of the things that for me I

217
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:13,198
found is the actual temperature of the

218
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,478
soil so I made the mistake a long time

219
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,520
ago of having kind of I suppose winter

220
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:20,399
time number one so a little bit strong a

221
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,620
little bit harder to keep the root Zone

222
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,478
temperature up but utilizing a heat map

223
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,120
so I'm not sure if you use utilizing a

224
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,878
heat mat or not but that might be what

225
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,500
is causing it not to root either that or

226
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,658
lack of oxygen in the root Zone maybe

227
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,820
the roots don't maybe the soil is too

228
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:38,819
moist it's just not getting that oxygen

229
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,839
that needs maybe drainage on the

230
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,940
containers I don't know if you're using

231
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,700
like Solo cups for example I used to

232
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,200
just slice the Solo cups I wish I had a

233
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,740
picture here to kind of show you but

234
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,720
just kind of slices versus taking out a

235
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,000
big amount of the bottom of the Solo

236
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,040
cups drastic difference you know now

237
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,080
that there's better drainage better air

238
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,458
getting down in there so those are the

239
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,139
things that I would check out if I were

240
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:03,479
you because those are kind of the main

241
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:06,000
reasons I've come across for things not

242
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,399
rooting when uh cloning and just putting

243
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,240
it directly into soil or cocoa have you

244
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,759
tried curing in Grove bags yes I have I

245
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,799
put them in the Grove bags eat sealed

246
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:20,458
them and put them into a wine fridge

247
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,719
okay so that's what I used for curing I

248
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,479
actually put a little hygrometer on

249
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,740
there I did Hold Steady at the 62

250
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,019
percent that's kind of what I was aiming

251
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,940
for it held steady there didn't have any

252
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,320
mold but I was just using a really for

253
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,120
curing I know some people are using it

254
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,920
for drying as well I think I haven't

255
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,860
used it for drying though the problem

256
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:40,679
with where I live is it's very hot here

257
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,480
right now it's uh well geez in here it's

258
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:45,299
about 78 degrees usually anywhere

259
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,820
between 75 78 degrees Fahrenheit that's

260
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,859
not great for storage and I spent many

261
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,278
many years just storing in room

262
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,560
temperature and uh month two months

263
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:59,220
later buds just planned you know the

264
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:01,799
flavors uh depleted it's uh volatized

265
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,940
it's it's gone so so I've storage

266
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,278
temperature has kind of been something

267
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,200
that I've been more focusing on between

268
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,120
the Canada troll using that for storage

269
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,700
that's good to get the temperature down

270
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,320
and also the wine fridge some people put

271
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,879
in refrigerators I've had to put in

272
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,180
refrigerators as well that's down to

273
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:20,039
about 40 degrees Fahrenheit so all those

274
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:22,139
are things that I've tried to kind of

275
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,480
stored temperature for curing curing

276
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:25,559
slash storage but the grill bags worked

277
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,000
pretty good you know I don't have any

278
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,739
complaints on them use them for a very

279
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
short period of time I will tell you

280
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,919
that though you just keep in the fridge

281
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,740
what temperature are you storing at on

282
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,958
the regular usually about 60 60 degrees

283
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:40,200
Fahrenheit is what I have my wine fridge

284
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,879
set to I have the uh I had the Canon

285
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,259
troll set to it and then I bumped I've

286
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:46,860
been playing around with a little bit

287
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:48,299
between 60 and 65 and to be honest with

288
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,120
you I haven't noticed a whole lot of uh

289
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:52,979
difference between 60 and 65 as far as

290
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,839
storage temperature fridge yeah like I

291
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,200
mentioned goes down to about 40 degrees

292
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:00,300
it actually varies between

293
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,278
um for me for the way I have my fresh

294
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:04,620
sat at everybody you know there's a dial

295
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:07,399
where you can adjust it but my range is

296
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:10,259
between I think 34 and 40 degrees

297
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,360
Fahrenheit just kind of what that range

298
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:14,159
is but uh yeah sometimes when I have to

299
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,959
when I when I'm drying in my canister I

300
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,719
got to put it elsewhere some of it fits

301
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:20,759
in the wine fridge Last Resort is the

302
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,680
actual regular bridge better than room

303
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,419
temperature that's for sure have you

304
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:26,519
tried the bottled organic nutrients

305
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:28,679
having some success with the bio and

306
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,659
outline yes I have I use Bloom yellow

307
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:34,019
bottles oh and by the way in regards to

308
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:36,539
answering questions about products yeah

309
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,720
if people ask them I will answer them I

310
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:41,578
know at least a q a video on my channel

311
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,200
and there was a lot of the questions had

312
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:44,639
to do with products and somebody in the

313
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,800
comment section it was a couple people I

314
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,059
think comment section like hey why are

315
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,439
you just talking about products all the

316
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:51,059
time what is this an infomercial it's

317
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,740
like I'm just answering questions here

318
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:54,778
if you got questions about products I'll

319
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,919
answer them you know so but this episode

320
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:58,740
actually has been a lot of plant

321
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:01,679
questions so those people won't be as

322
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,839
much of keyboard Warriors as I'm sure

323
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,359
but Bloom yellow bottles yeah I use them

324
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,980
that line I had some good results in but

325
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,079
there's just so many bottles in that

326
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,579
line that was just a major turn off for

327
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,679
me it was just the amount of bottles

328
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:15,239
there and it's very expensive although

329
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,039
it's a very concentrated line so you

330
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,778
don't have to use much there's just

331
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,458
there's a lot of bottles and it adds up

332
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:22,200
very quickly so yeah I had pretty good

333
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:24,419
luck with that I haven't used any other

334
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,160
bottle organic nutrients what can I use

335
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:27,838
for silica other than rice holes and

336
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,759
Bottles good question I mean

337
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,079
diatomaceous earth is some silicon they

338
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,958
have I don't know how many people use it

339
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:36,359
as an amendment for silica stash blend

340
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,399
this got it right Shameless plug stash

341
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,560
blinds got some silica in there so you

342
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,019
could pick up a bag of stash blend and

343
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,179
then it's powdered form so longer shelf

344
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:48,539
life than liquid mix it up into water

345
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:51,000
and then soil drench and yeah and get

346
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:53,159
silica that way but yeah rice Halls kind

347
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,159
of bottled forms or seemed to be the

348
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:57,419
most popular forms of silica trying to

349
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,919
think of other amendments off top my

350
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:01,019
head let me know in the comments what am

351
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:03,659
I missing I'm missing something on air

352
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:06,240
what kind of pots do you use I've been

353
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:08,699
using the 10 gallon fabric pots I used a

354
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,440
living soil fabric pots by Grassroots

355
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,240
fabric pots they actually have a

356
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,040
discount code Mr Grow it if you get

357
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,539
anything off of them but they're the

358
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:18,599
fabric Parts with the liner in the

359
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:20,578
middle there so living soil you know

360
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,278
when you're growing organically out in

361
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:24,539
nature the soil doesn't dry out from all

362
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,700
angles like it does with the normal

363
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:29,699
fabric pot right so they have the liner

364
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,860
in their fabric pots so it just really

365
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,480
dries out from the top down there is

366
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,220
some fabric on the bottom part where you

367
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,079
can get some drying up from the bottom

368
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,360
there as well a little bit but that

369
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:41,879
actually adds aeration in there so I've

370
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,459
been using the 10 gallon pots from them

371
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,980
and I like them for that I was using

372
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:49,138
seven gallon plastic I mean I'm using so

373
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,860
much over the years five gallon three

374
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:55,019
gallon but over the past three four

375
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:58,079
years ish pots have been getting bigger

376
00:13:55,019 --> 00:14:00,959
and I've been growing organic what is

377
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:03,719
the best way to lower PPM when you using

378
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,338
GH well you could just do a lower dosage

379
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,800
so when you're mixing up your nutrients

380
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:09,060
in water you can instead of doing a full

381
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:11,399
dose according to the feeding schedule

382
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:13,559
some people do a half dose quarter dose

383
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,059
so on and so forth if you gotten to the

384
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:18,059
point where you've actually added in the

385
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:20,638
nutrients already mixed them up and then

386
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:24,778
put the TDS tester in there to see the

387
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,278
PPM or our EC meter cdec we realize it

388
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:28,320
was too high and you're like oh no I

389
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:29,700
don't want this to be this strong a lot

390
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,120
of people just dilute they'll just add

391
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:36,480
in water dilute that mix down to their

392
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,578
desired EC or PPM before watering in so

393
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,079
not sure if you thought of that but uh I

394
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:42,239
think it was worth mentioning you feel

395
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,859
like you water more in fabric yes yeah

396
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,600
absolutely for me I mean I'm just

397
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,120
straight fabric pots not talking about

398
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,860
the Grassroots living soil pots that I

399
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,659
mentioned earlier for sure it definitely

400
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,820
dries out at all angles and I'm watering

401
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:55,919
more often there's more aeration you

402
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,320
know so it's it's normal I live in a

403
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,240
very dry climate it's 35 percent RH here

404
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,699
right now in this room and so I'm always

405
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,980
adding in humidity with the humidifier

406
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:07,078
for example but yeah definitely watering

407
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,820
more in fabric that's one of the reasons

408
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:10,620
why I've opted if you've seen a lot of

409
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,899
my videos over the recent years it's

410
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,820
using a lot of plastic using plastic

411
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:16,559
pots I like to be able to wash them out

412
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,120
and reuse them too you know I mean I

413
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:19,559
know you can do that with the fabric you

414
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,440
can wash those out and reuse them and

415
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:24,599
stuff but uh plastic pots of I'm working

416
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,459
fine for me so I kind of I haven't

417
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,440
really been using fabric pots besides

418
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,958
the living soil pots that I mentioned

419
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,060
best way to lower PPM week three of veg

420
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,518
runoff at 1800. how does the plants look

421
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:37,679
plants look okay just water for a while

422
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,720
water only for a little while until you

423
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,599
get the PPM where you want it but 1800

424
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,699
isn't too crazy so people go upwards of

425
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,759
2000 PPM assuming you're talking about

426
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:50,639
the 500 scale TDS tester when you talk

427
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,198
about the PPM that's more common unless

428
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,440
you're in Europe I know a lot of folks

429
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:58,198
do the 700 scale but just water you know

430
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,820
water for the future times the medium

431
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:01,439
needs it and then you'll see that it'll

432
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,519
eventually lower or down now if your

433
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,800
plants are struggling that's a different

434
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,959
story right A lot of people that blame

435
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:10,198
they'll flush you know so I'm not sure

436
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:12,269
if using synthetic organic inputs that

437
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:13,799
would uh make a difference there as well
