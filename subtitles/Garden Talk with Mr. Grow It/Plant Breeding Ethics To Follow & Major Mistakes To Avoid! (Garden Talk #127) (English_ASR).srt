while since I had a breeder on here it's

62
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:17,519
been uh quite some time it's always good

63
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,239
conversations when we're talking about

64
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,120
plant breeding because there's so many

65
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,000
different Avenues you can go down so

66
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,239
much we can get into in this particular

00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,560
about mistakes that breeders make and

70
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,000
get into some controversial topics when

71
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,560
it comes to breeding and so I'm really

72
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
excited for this one but before we get

73
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,439
deep into it can you do an introduction

74
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,560

75
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:43,759
how you got into gardening all right I'm

76
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,400
Josh founder of elite cut genetics

77
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:49,719
breeder from the Chicagoland area and uh

78
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,200
when I first got into uh the plant we

79
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:54,479
all know and love started reading a lot

80
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,919
about it from like the Jorge survant

81
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,158
book he had you know the the grow Bible

82
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:00,639
or I forgot what I think it was called

83
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:03,719
the grow Bible and he also had a box set

84
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,919
like DVD for like setting up rooms like

85
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:08,239
it was like I think a two or three DVD

86
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:11,958
uh set so I had all that I think that

87
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,439
was around like yeah like 2007 2008 and

88
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,239
started really just like kind of just

89
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,560
reading about it and just kind of like

90
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,599
getting into it but didn't really start

91
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,039
until uh the 2011 which was you know

92
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:24,479
that summer so you know back then it was

93

highly illegal you know you couldn't

94
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,959

99
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,400

it with me you know me and him talked

103
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,400
about it we wanted to do it for years

104
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,560
basically and then the that year 2011 we

105
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,599
decided to uh start a gorilla Garden so

106
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,479
we went into the forest I got uh seeds

107
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,238
from Attitude Seed Bank you know back in

108
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,840
the day they sent it in like a t-shirt

109
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,280
you know it was all sketch to like try

110
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,959
to order seeds and genetics you know and

111
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,560
there wasn't really access like there is

112
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,920
now like you had to order basically from

113
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,519
the European guys who were running it so

114
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:17,079
like we had like the Barney's Farm uh

115
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:21,079
denm and uh we had like the blue hash

116
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:23,519
plant uh California hash plant uh

117
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,560
critical plus Vanilla

118
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,519
Kush uh and actually the first ever Auto

119
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,879
flow see looking back it's crazy cuz

120
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:32,279
it's came so far with auto flowers but

121
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,319
back then it was a new thing and it was

122
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:36,478
like oh hey we can get an extra harvest

123
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,879
in the middle of summer so we had the

124
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:42,360
original low rider seeds which are the

125
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:44,319
first ever Auto flowers ever made so we

126
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,240
had those we had like the ones I just

127
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,719
mentioned so we had like three different

128
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,519
patches out there man and one was the

129
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,120
low riders and we had like another patch

130
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:55,680
like five over here and another patch

131
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,560
over here you know and learning from the

132
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,160
book and the DVDs it was like you know

133
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,839
never take the same path twice face you

134
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,039
know don't be talking so every time we

135
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,799
went out there it was like a mission you

136
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,399
know we'd be like like we're in the army

137
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,079
or something giving hand signals

138
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,599
listening going out there and that's

139
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:13,399
when we did it and uh it was it was a

140
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,479
lot of work I can tell you that you know

141
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,159
lugging lugging soil out there you know

142
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:21,639
it was just it turned into a huge

143
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,680
undertaking but we had a creek there out

144
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,560
in the woods so we had water access

145
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,759
nearby it was a forest preserve there

146
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,800
was really no one you know going through

147
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,038
there besides like there's like a a

148
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,800
couple of ranches where uh guys on

149
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:37,839
Horseback go through on like the horse

150
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,960
trails but that was basically it so we

151
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,839
were out there and uh that same summer

152
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,120
actually got raided so you know like

153
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:48,560
many of us in those days you know um got

154
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:52,959
in trouble for working with the plant so

155
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,038
uh yeah so that was August 15th 2011 so

156
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,000
okay that puts us like right when the

157
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:00,279
plants start flowering right so now we

158
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,478
have all this stuff out there now I'm in

159
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:04,279
trouble okay so I they got me with you

160
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,959
know I think it was around like six six

161
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:09,519
PBS or something like that but uh yeah

162
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,038
so now I need money for lawyers you know

163
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,959
they got me for a lot and now I don't

164
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,360
have like ways to bring the funds back

165

173
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:34,038
thing that took way longer than I

174
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,840
thought you know going out there like

175
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:37,719

177
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,000
even cut the stock it was like you know

178
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,680

179
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,319
the nice Clippers it would be good but

180
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,400
no so I'm just like doing the branches

181
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,879
just leaving the main stock you know

182
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:52,079
just you know stuff them in bags and

183
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:53,399
then my buddy would come down pick me up

184
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,878
throw it in the trunk had to take

185
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:58,079
multiple trips so you know and this

186
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,319
whole time obviously I'm I'm like

187
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,478
paranoid and freaking out because

188
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,759
you know uh I didn't cooperate with the

189
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:08,360
police so the next day you know I bonded

190
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:10,639
out $88,000 and soon as I left they are

191
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,598
tailing me they are already at my mom's

192

196
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,560
they found notes you know they didn't

197
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,280
know what it pertained to there was some

198
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,079
stuff in the works but it just never

199
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,959
happened because of that but uh so yeah

200
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,159
2011 we did it and and you know we

201
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,799
pulled it off we pulled it off

202
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,400
you know we harvested them you know we

203
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,800
had involved like a couple other people

204
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,159
like my girlfriend's brother and his

205
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,759
friend cuz now I couldn't had this stuff

206
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,360
around you know like I was looking at

207
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,038
you know 6 to eight years as a

208
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,360
20-year-old kid so I mean that really uh

209
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:47,680
that does that's traumatic it's

210
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,759
definitely traumatic but you know at

211
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,639
that time it was like man I I got to do

212
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:56,400
this now I got lawyer fees all this and

213
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,120
uh so we did it you know was successful

214
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,758
had to you know involve a couple other

215
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,158
people so we broke them off to do but we

216
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:05,400
had all this bud you know and it was you

217
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:08,560
know it was great like I said the the

218
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,758
blue hash the C hash plant Vanilla Kush

219
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,639
and all those old school like European

220
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,400
breeders like Barney farm and dfm and

221
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,720
like the freebies you'd get from

222
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:18,959
attitude you know whatever pling some of

223
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,440
those too but those were like the main

224
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:24,519
ones I can remember uh growing out there

225
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:27,279
and then so after that pretty much took

226
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:30,038
like a 10-year Hiatus off of anything

227
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,758
you know plant related cuz it was a good

228
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:34,718
three or four years of just you know

229
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:38,158
fighting in in court for my freedom you

230
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,479
know they took cars you know laptops TVs

231
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:40,918
they just clear you out especially when

232
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,599
you're not cooperating it's like they're

233
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:44,838
going to make an example of you and mock

234
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:48,800
you you know while you're sitting there

235
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:50,600
you know cuffed up whatever so so then I

236
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,519
was living in California for a few years

237
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,639
wasn't doing anything uh with

238
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:57,000
cultivation but uh we know Co happened

239
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:59,519
you know a lot of people started getting

240
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,200
laid off and at the time my my

241
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,799
girlfriend was pregnant with our first

242
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,480
son so I'm originally from the Chicago

243
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:09,199
land area and uh so we moved back for

244
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,680
family support and when I moved back you

245
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,079
know the laws were different it was a

246
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:15,719
completely different time so like

247
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:18,519
instantly I was like let's go you know

248
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,759
and I started started growing and very

249
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,720
quickly just started doing more doing

250
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,720
more before six months were up I was

251
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,000
already Crossing stuff you know making

252
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,680
feminized crosses nothing that I

253
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,679
released just just experience just

254
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,679
building it just you know just getting

255
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,879
the hang of it and seeing what comes out

256
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,799
on the other end and you know checking

257
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:38,078
out the progy to see what they express

258
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:40,078
and all that and you know picked up some

259
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,278
small lighting deals right around then

260
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:46,199
to spider farmer Viper Spectra sending

261
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:49,159
me you know lights to to try and uh yeah

262
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,560
man so that's that's uh when it started

263
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:53,000
but like I said there was a long Hiatus

264
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:55,359
and we've been going pretty much since

265
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,039
the pandemic uh started I just been

266
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,240
going at it man going at it and just

267
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:02,719
keep making a connection and

268
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,278
establishing those networks and uh being

269
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,360
around people who share passion with

270
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:10,278
what I what I love so it's like you know

271
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,320
I just I I love it I really do so it's

272
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:15,159
therapeutic for me I think a lot of

273
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,519
people can relate so yeah spending time

274
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:19,559
with my plants taking care of my plants

275
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,679
and creating new things you know and and

276
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,078
seeding life around the globe you know

277
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,319
when you're sending seeds out to

278
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,519
different countries and all over the

279
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,839
United States you know they're they're

280
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,679
growing these out and getting to see

281
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,519
those pictures and just knowing that

282
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:34,078
that's happening all over and you know

283
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,480
you're help spreading that and to me

284
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:39,159
that's an amazing feeling so yeah so

285
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,720
yeah that's uh pretty much how it

286
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:43,278
started and yeah man I love it we're

287
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,800
going to keep going man you've been

288
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,159
through a lot uh I can only imagine you

289
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:49,399
know a lot of people they'll just give

290
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:51,559
up after getting busted right but you

291
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,958
came back to it right and you gained

292
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:55,479
that motivation was it mostly just the

293
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,719
kind of the legalization that happened

294
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,120
within your area that kind of got you

295
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,720
back into it and still having that love

296
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,639
with the plant or well see I've always

297
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,360
loved gardening already you know my

298
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,759
dad's instilled that on me we've had

299
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,879
Gardens ever since I was little you know

300
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:10,600
I got chickens now you know I just I

301
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,360
love plants my grandmother like we used

302
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,680
to go like get like cool fancy house

303
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,800
plants and uh you know I'd get to pick

304
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,319
out one too hey you can pick one out too

305
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:20,679
and you know there'd be like a

306
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,600
greenhouse where they're selling like

307
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:25,319
all these cool plants so I was involved

308
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,680
with that at an early age and uh

309
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,360
basically yeah it's like an ultimate

310
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:29,919
revenge on my past and everything that

311
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,680
happened to me and that was taken from

312
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,599
me at that time and you know kind of

313
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,399
being ahead of my time cuz like you know

314
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,759
I a lot of people wanted to start up

315
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,720
grows and yeah it was like the money

316
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:40,360
grab like yeah money was a factor but it

317
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,800
was like man I just really wanted to do

318
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,759
it you know I was uh had subscriptions

319
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:47,319
for High Times magazines I still got the

320
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,319
boxes just straight up like a fiveyear

321
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,720
subscription worth of High Times

322
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:55,160
magazines getting sent to my house so

323
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,278
straight up big boxes of them so yeah

324
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:59,039
man yeah it was just basically like

325
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,240
seeing that the laws are changing seeing

326
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:03,159
that the stigma is changing and seeing

327
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,200
that I can participate and become like

328
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:08,159
you know a legal business and just

329
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,040
something that just felt right it was

330
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:13,240
just like a calling to me and so like I

331
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,519
was doing it on the side for a few years

332
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,120
before I launched a leite cut so like

333
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,879
basically I launched a leak cut on

334
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,799
Instagram I think it was like December

335
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:26,078
22nd 2022 so right at the end of

336
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:29,599
2022 so basically yeah just like over a

337
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:32,159
year and a half or close to close to but

338
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,159
um yeah man it it's been it's been a

339
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,360
crazy journey and it's like like I said

340
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,399
an ultimate revenge on my past and

341
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,320
everything that's happened to me it's

342
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:40,839
like man I'm it just motivates me to

343
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,800
just like dude you're on the right track

344
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,320
and I just felt this calling you know

345
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,078
like and it just started as an idea cuz

346
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,120
I worked in warehousing I know you've

347
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:51,278
talked about used to you know work at

348
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,120
Amazon so you know being a warehouse

349
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:56,958
grantt that can get old very fast you

350
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,679
know loud equipment all around and hey

351
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,399
you know you you have liquid that's a

352
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:03,278
Coca-Cola not water you can't have that

353
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,000
you know all these things that you deal

354
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,958
with and being around a lot of people

355
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,320
who don't have like that mindset and if

356
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,479
you do have that entrepreneurial like

357
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,600
mindset and you want more for yourself

358
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,959
you can't really connect with these

359
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,199
people and it's like being around these

360
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,000
people are just going to like bring you

361
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:18,759
down you know it's like you need to

362
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,120
surround yourself with people who are

363
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:22,198
doing things you want to do you want to

364
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,039
get into the rooms that you weren't in

365
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:26,078
before you know and connect with people

366
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:27,319
who are entrepreneurs who have their own

367
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,120
businesses you know like that's the

368
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,360
circle I'm building now and there's like

369
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,159
like a great community in the midwest

370
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,440
here and I've met some amazing people

371
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:37,360
and most of them yeah were vendors at

372
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,000
events and now like I'm working with

373
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,159
some of them and you know one's my

374
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,159

375
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:48,519
the flowers so um yeah man it's been an

376
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:50,439
amazing journey I I uh I'm stoked to be

377
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:52,799
here talking with Mr Grow been watching

378
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,639
you too like you kind of came out during

379
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:58,039
the pandemic and stuff too right so

380

guys you know so and I still be watching

382
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,560
an episodes so that's just what I like

383
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:08,240
to listen to while I'm working in the

384
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:10,958
garden so um yeah man it's it's been

385
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,278
amazing been amazing that's awesome yeah

386
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,719
you've sounds like you have come a long

387
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,879
way since you got busted I mean now

388
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,800
you're all the way into doing breeding

389
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:20,958
and that's really what we're going to

390
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,958
dive it deep into today and I want to

391
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:26,239
start with ethics okay so there's an

392
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:28,559
ethical way to go about it and there's

393
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,959
another ethical way to go about it how

394
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:35,119
do you fine ethical breeding practices

395
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:36,518
okay ethical breeding practices so well

396
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,519
you got to watch out for the guys that

397
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:40,399
are just crossing stuff packaging it

398
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,159
sending it out and there's a lot of that

399
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,958
going on and there's a lot of like uh

400
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:47,078
fake cuts going around people passing

401
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,278
stuff around saying oh this it's this

402
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:50,919
and then they cross it and they're

403
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:53,000
saying it's this but it's really not or

404
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:55,519
they're not testing their their plants

405
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,720
that they're uh you know Crossing so now

406
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,919
you know hop PL and vroid can transfer

407
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,079
into seed form too so so now they're

408
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,799
sending out seed packs that are just

409
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,359
infected which is just going to just be

410
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,519
horrible for the gene pool be horrible

411
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,039
for anyone's experience trying to grow

412
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,799
genetics so I mean really testing your

413
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,519
mother stock you know knowing the plants

414
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,000
that you're that you're Crossing you

415
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,879
know like I understand real estate is

416
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,679
limited sometimes so like if you if you

417
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,720
have to go on like uh you kind of know

418
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:26,758
the turine profile or you know the cut

419
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,480
already but no matter what you need to

420
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:32,079
be exploring the progyny and see

421
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,519
like how the genetics react together you

422
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:38,559
know so knowing what you're starting

423
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:40,959
with you know for sure verified genetics

424
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,559
and uh having clean Mother stock so

425
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,559
testing stock

426
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,198
regularly and uh you know not just

427
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:47,439
crossing Stu and just sending it out

428
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:50,039
there and if you're going to sell

429
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,759
untested gear be upfront about what

430
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:55,000
you're doing just be transparent and be

431
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,600
genuine about who you are and uh that's

432
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,720
that's the way to go about it cuz like

433
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,240
you know there's a lot of guys like I

434
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,839
say just like white labeling nothing

435
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,799
wrong with it that's cool you know they

436
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,959
buy seeds from overseas package them and

437
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:09,519
sell them under their brand or whatever

438
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,958
but uh you know for me I like to be

439
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,879
Hands-On with it it's like some of these

440
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,318
companies are getting so big so

441
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,519
commercialized that they're just like

442
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:18,360
running through gear and just dropping

443
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:19,919
seed lines every month like how can you

444
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,278
really have a true connection to like

445
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,759
what you're doing like I understand it's

446
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,120
a business but it starts becoming like

447
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:27,919
corporatized and like you know you start

448
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,480
losing the craft you know like we want

449
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,679
to be kind of like craft small batch you

450
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,240
know some stuff we'll remake maybe if

451
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:36,799
you know it's it's selling out like

452
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,159
crazy but otherwise it's like the seeds

453
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,879
that are that are made are that's it and

454
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:43,879
once they're gone they're gone you know

455
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:46,480
craft small batch connoisseur genetics

456
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:48,600
so starting off with clean motherto

457
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,120
testing your gear being transparent

458
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,560
about what you do and what you're

459
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,799
bringing to the table so and if you're

460
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,559
cross in uh like other people's stuff

461
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,799
like like we do oneoff crosses too so

462
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:01,799
like you know if you can get the same

463
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:03,439
blue cookies cut that I got and you can

464
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:05,000
get the same permanent marker that's

465
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,720
going around and you cross those well

466
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,640
those seeds are going to be identical so

467
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,400
it's like a couple different breeders

468
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,400
might be making that same cross you know

469
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,798
so it's like it becomes more yours once

470
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,120
you start making those selections but

471
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:18,679
there's nothing wrong with that either

472
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,438
but just be transparent about what

473
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:24,079
you're doing and uh you know what you're

474
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,439
offering and if you're conversating with

475
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,318
me like you're going to be able to see

476
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,320
how genuine I am if you're talking to

477
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:31,159
someone who's kind of like Wishy Wash or

478
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:33,519
don't know what they're talking about

479
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,279
yeah man yeah it's fire yeah you know

480
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,000
might want to question it a little bit

481
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:38,678
more you know about who who you're

482
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,679
working with what are some of the

483
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:43,720
questions that people can ask breeders

484
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,440
in order to make sure that they are

485
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,480
ethical breeders yeah ask them ask them

486
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,960
like you know flowering times ask them

487
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,120
like kind of what you see in

488
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,240
phenotypical expression stuff like that

489
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,879
or like uh the parent lines you know the

490
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,359
parent uh plants what they bring to the

491
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,360
table and

492
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,798
and uh other questions like hey you got

493
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,599
the the report for you know the lab

494
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:09,038
report on your negative hop Laton viroid

495
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:11,399
tests stuff like that you know asking

496
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:14,279
for tests and just asking them about

497
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,400
their process you know just asking more

498
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:19,480
questions is definitely a good thing to

499
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,519
do cuz you know there's lots of great uh

500
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,200
pictures and stuff online that you can

501
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,960
just oh this is banging plant but it's

502
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,640
like okay what's it truly expressing

503
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,120
what's truly coming through you know

504
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,720
what I'm saying so just asking more

505
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,558
questions about what you're getting you

506
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,919
know and those lab reports and just you

507
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,599
know all kinds of stuff like that ask

508
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,679
more questions don't just look at the

509
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,639
picture and be like buyer that's it yeah

510
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,480
let me get that you know so do a little

511
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,080
more research on what you want no kind

512
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,200
of the tpine profiles you like to go

513
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:51,599
after too you know that's something so

514
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,159
those are a few things I can think of so

515
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,480
testing your mother's stock just asking

516
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:58,520
more questions asking them their process

517
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,120
on like uh what they look for in plants

518
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:03,240
or what they're seeing in the in the

519
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:06,079
progyny so stuff like that are all great

520
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,679
questions so okay awesome now you

521
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:10,158
mentioned one of the things you

522
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:13,080
shouldn't really do is just create a

523
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:15,640
cross uh and then send it out are you

524
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:17,119
talking like f1s I know some people say

525
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,159
you shouldn't they say you shouldn't be

526
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,918
selling f1s at all f1s shouldn't never

527
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:24,200
be on the market that's just their

528
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:25,919
belief others say no f1's perfectly fine

529
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,519
want the initial cross send it out and

530
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,159
have the consumer find what they're

531
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:33,079
looking looking for they have a variety

532
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:36,400
there to choose from what's your take on

533
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:37,879
f1s selling f1s man I I think there's

534
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,759
nothing wrong with it I think you know

535
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,960
you can go a couple different directions

536
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,079
is you know you make some oneoff crosses

537
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,079
if you're making okay you're making a

538
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:47,000
seed line right you got the chill out OG

539
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:49,678
you're going to refine it bring it to F4

540
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,640
or whatever okay well maybe you like the

541
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,519
grape gasoline cut that you know maybe I

542
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,360
send you and you grew that out we throw

543
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,079
it in there with it you know cross it to

544
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,839
a couple other things and uh see what

545
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:03,158
comes out there there but um yeah f1s

546
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:05,798
should can be sold definitely oneof

547
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:07,240
crosses there's nothing wrong with that

548
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:09,798
but there's also working lines which is

549
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,159
like refining it further you know so if

550
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:13,798
you're refining something further and

551
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,400
kind of focusing your energy on on a

552
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:17,359
certain crost you still cross to a

553
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,440
couple other things cuz the amount of

554
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:20,959
work you put in isn't going to guarantee

555
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,240
that your seed Line's going to sell out

556
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,798
you know it's not going to guarantee

557
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,159
that at all so it's like you can put in

558
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:26,918
years of work that doesn't mean you're

559
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:30,200
going to be able to charge a higher

560
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:32,320
price or none of that so like it's good

561
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,720
to be focusing and refining on things

562
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:36,759
and working lines but it's like like I

563
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,159
said real estate's limited especially if

564
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:40,319
you're a smaller breeder who doesn't

565
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,360
have like huge facilities so you know

566
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,839
you focus some attention and work some

567
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:45,439
lines but then you also just have some

568
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,918
one-off crosses that people can just

569
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,600
select their phenotype from because you

570
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,759
know a lot of these are all poly hybrids

571
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:55,359
anyway so there's going to be variation

572
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:57,798
in the phenotypic expression so um yeah

573
00:20:55,359 --> 00:21:00,079
man I think I think that's still a good

574
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,359
thing you can still cell f1s just as

575
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,000
long as you're not just like sending

576
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,639
them out without like any type of

577
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,119
testing or if you're selling them

578
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,520
without testing be upfront about what

579
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:09,959
you're doing and have a price point that

580
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,798
matches it you know what I'm saying and

581
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,278
uh or send out testers like if they

582
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:16,879
support you and buy packs then send out

583
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:18,720
a tester packs with what it is you know

584
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,480
and you start getting some feedback out

585
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,798
there plus if you run some now you have

586
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,720
a little more to go off of you know when

587
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,558
you uh release these so like I got my

588
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,120
trap Cherry Line so it's like six

589
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:31,000
different crosses

590
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,479
but like a couple that I'm really into

591
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,558
and that our fan favorites is the black

592
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,319
Trey Bliss so I'm going to refine that

593
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,720
one I'm going to pheno hunt that one

594
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:41,079
bring it to F2 people want it already

595
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,960
and uh but then there's other stuff that

596
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:44,399
I just won't I'm just leave it as is and

597
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,798
move on to another project cuz we can

598
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,519
only work on so many things you know

599
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:50,200
what I'm saying it's always uh you

600
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:52,798
always got to kind of pick and choose

601
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,319
and and yeah it can be hard sometimes

602
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:58,000
but well worth it well worth it you talk

603
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:59,599
about it's okay to sell f1s as long as

604
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,720
you be in trans transparent things

605
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,399
should be tested you could potentially

606
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,919
sell things that aren't tested as long

607
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,240
as you're transparent I think a good

608
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,440
example of that is Robin Hood seeds then

609
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,400
some people don't know this but Robin

610
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,919
Hood seeds they don't test exactly and

611
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,880
they have a little bit low of a price

612
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,159
because of that and so they're very

613
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,480
transparent and yeah there are companies

614
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,960
out there that just don't test and they

615
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,558
send them out but they're transparent

616
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,079
about it and there are companies out

617
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,720
there who don't test and they're not

618
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:28,918
transparent about they lie about and say

619
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,360
they are tested and send the

620
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,799
unfortunately there's a lot of problems

621
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:35,798
that happen talking about the testing

622
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:38,319
process you know after you create those

623
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:40,558
seeds what do you do in order to get

624
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:43,000
them tested to make sure they're good to

625
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:45,720
go before hitting the market well I have

626
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,480
a few close grommies you know that I can

627
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,400
uh put the seeds with them and they can

628
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,120
grow some out I'll grow some out you

629
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,640
know what I'm saying so and getting some

630
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,439
testers out too so it's just getting

631
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,440
some gear out there for people to grow

632
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,600
plus you know we be growing it too but

633
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,278
uh yeah man just just grow some stuff

634
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:05,639
out you got to grow it out and check it

635
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:07,720
out you got to see what's going on in

636
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,000
there you know before you're offering it

637
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,679
to people so but yeah there's a lot of

638
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,480
that going on and going back to Robin

639
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:18,000
Hood seeds and square one genetics same

640
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,400
guy does both those Square One genetics

641
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
obviously is the more high-end higher

642
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,880
price stuff Robin Hood seeds a little

643
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,919
bit lower now see he's doing the same

644
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,720
thing is what I'm kind of talking about

645
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:29,000
he's focusing his attention on certain

646
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,038
things While others he's like okay I

647
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,880
didn't put as much time or effort into

648
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:36,599
this or you know it hasn't been heavily

649
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,039
tested or you know even tested at all

650
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:40,439
you know so he's putting that under a

651
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:42,200
whole another brand you know so like and

652
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,200
he's being transparent about it see

653
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,200
that's the the good way to do it so I

654
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,159
mean Big Ups to THC Titan for keeping it

655
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,120
real there he's awesome I had him on a

656
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:55,919
different podcast geez had to have been

657
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:57,359
2017 by now a long long time ago and uh

658
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,919
great great conversation I need to get

659
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,319
him on the guard and talk by podcast I

660
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:02,240
like to get him on here because he's a

661
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:04,558
wealth of knowledge and he's been doing

662
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,960
it for I believe he crossed 10 years now

663
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:07,639
so he's got a ton of knowledge in

664
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,400
regards to that yeah that's awesome

665
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,278
these These are the guys I look up to I

666
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,880
want to like work with some of these

667
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:16,359
guys uh you know at some point you know

668
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,960
and uh something I'd like to say too

669
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:19,199
like so some of the gentics we cross

670
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,840
like I said you can you can get the

671
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,558
permanent marker cut you can maybe get

672
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:26,119
the blue c cookies cut you know so like

673
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:27,960
those can be replicated you know but but

674
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:29,239
it's it's not you know there's nothing

675
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,600
wrong with that though you know like I

676
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,120
said if you're offering some stuff that

677
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:33,759
other companies offer that's just part

678
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:35,678
of the game but sometimes you get hate

679
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:38,240
from from these bigger guys who are kind

680
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,559
of clicked up or whatever but like uh

681
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,919
like right now I'm working on like a

682
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:44,720
slur cane number seven line so I've got

683
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,240
a reversal going you know the S1 isn't

684
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,600
the main focus cuz I'm not really trying

685
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,359
to push the s1's you know from a guy

686
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:52,240
who's already you know selling the s1's

687
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:54,839
but like I'll reach out to them like hey

688
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,399
man I'm working on this slur cane line

689
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:57,839
you know let them know like kind of like

690
00:24:56,398 --> 00:24:59,879
reach out to him you know and let them

691
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,398
know what's going on like yo I'm not

692
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,240
trying to step on your toes you know I

693
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:05,199
just like to communicate with them and

694
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,880
it can open up the door for opportunity

695
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,480
later down the line but you know I'm

696
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,880
working on you know other crosses but an

697
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,798
S1 was made and we're going to sell the

698
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,399
S1 and we already know it's stable since

699
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:14,839
inhouse has released it so yeah we're

700
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:16,000
going to release it but like there's not

701
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:18,359
going to be a lot of them that's not the

702
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,159
main focus but we also got to you know

703
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:21,879
survive as we're competing against some

704
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,919
of these huge guys who can just pump out

705
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,919
lines month after month you know what

706
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,120
I'm saying and they're just playing the

707
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:27,640
numbers game on what's going to hit

708
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:29,359
what's going to make the numbers and it

709
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,320
just keep going you know what I'm saying

710
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:34,038
so the SLC number seven there's lots of

711
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,079
guys who haven't got to even run that

712
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:37,839
you know I think California and a lot of

713
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:40,000
those breed stuff they move so fast

714
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:41,319
through stuff like that's such old news

715
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,440
to them that I don't really feel that

716
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:45,079
that's really stepping on their toes but

717
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,600
still going to reach out and just let

718
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:48,119
them know let them know that hey you

719
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:50,000
know I'm working on this I got some s

720
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:52,319
On's not the main focus but hey you know

721
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,480
would love to you know even collaborate

722
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,398
with you sometime or you know I'd even

723
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,038
uh you know I'd even put money down just

724
00:25:57,398 --> 00:26:02,879
just to support that breeder like yo you

725
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:05,679
know I'm supporting your work type thing

726
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,960
so got it I want to get into pollen

727
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,880
chucking next this is another practice

728
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,079
that some say is ontical others say it's

729
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,840
perfectly fine first of all what is

730
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:16,199
pollen shucking in case there somebody

731
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:18,959
in the audience that doesn't know what

732
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,600
it actually is what is it and what are

733
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,960
your thoughts on it all right B shucking

734
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:26,439
you're getting some Pond and you're

735
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,480
chucking it on some plants you know

736
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,798
there's no real Direction you don't

737
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,720
really know you're just maybe just kind

738
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:34,440
of seeing what's happening and you're

739
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,759
just crossing it you know and you you

740
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,399
know there's not much Direction and then

741
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:39,879
you know if they're just for you that's

742
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:42,239
cool you can hunt through and find your

743
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,760
own phenotype but if you're selling them

744
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,038
on the market and you're just chucking

745
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:48,720
pollen you might not even flower out the

746
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,798
cuts you're like oh I just acquired you

747
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,640
know gelato 33 or the permanent marker

748
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:55,158
and now you just throw it into a

749
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,960
reversal tent you know and pollinate

750
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:59,520
some stuff hopefully it's it's the right

751
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,038
genetics right you know otherwise you're

752
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,960
going to have some issues but basically

753
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:05,759
just rushing into just throwing p on

754
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,640
things you know with with no direction

755
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:11,359
or real purpose you know so uh I don't

756
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,720
think it's necessarily a bad thing I

757
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,678
mean some people might consider some of

758
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,880
the stuff we do po as pollen chucking

759
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,399
you know cuz some of the crosses are

760
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,480
just kind of oneoff crosses I know both

761
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,038
parent plants already but you know that

762
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,200
might be considered pollen chucking or

763
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:26,640
whatever but uh I think it goes back to

764
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,558
like your intentions on on what you're

765
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,200
trying to do you know are you just doing

766
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:31,960
it for yourself you're just trying to

767
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,440
like hook up with some buddies you're

768
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,720
just trying to find something cool or

769
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,360
are you like packaging these things and

770
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,200
putting them to Market and like saying

771
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,798
it's this or that when you don't even

772
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,440
know you know you didn't even grow out

773
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:44,319
the cut that you reversed onto all the

774
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,880
other Cuts you don't even know if it's

775
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,200
the right plant if you've never grown it

776
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,960
I mean yeah you can muddy the waters

777
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,880
real quick going that direction so yeah

778
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,798
there's a way to do it and there's a way

779
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,480
not to do it and typically pollen

780
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:00,759
chucking is referred to the person just

781
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,839
chucking it with no purpose no Direction

782
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:05,558
kind of just doing it so what if they

783
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,879
were transparent about it they're like

784
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:10,000
yeah I paen Chuck these and you know I

785
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,559
did this cross and this cross I cross

786
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,599
this with this this with this this with

787
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:16,000
this and packaged them up put them on

788
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,038
market like you should get this from it

789
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,599
it was a pollen chalk full disclosure I

790
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:22,879
haven't grown it out blah blah blah you

791
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:25,359
know is that okay in your eyes or is

792
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,760
that just they should be okay because

793
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,839
it's like certain people are going to

794
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:30,798
like steer away right away most of the

795
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:32,639
experienced people but then it also

796
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,079
depend what's the price point you know

797
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,440
what you are you trying to be like yo

798
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:40,079
these are $200 seed packs dog like this

799
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,240
you know or like yo like you know these

800
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:45,119
are $20 $30 packs or whatever you know

801
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,000
and this is what it is you know I don't

802
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,759
have the space or the means to do this

803
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,200
I'm just trying to offer something that

804
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:53,599
I think is cool you know it's kind of

805
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,600
like on a smaller level you know of uh

806
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:58,439
being a breeder you know pollen chucker

807
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:01,158
or whatever so yeah is as long as you're

808
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,200
transparent it's the guys that really

809
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:05,320
that that irks me that don't that like

810
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,720
if you do I mean man Big Ups to you like

811
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:09,000
you're straight up like yo here it is if

812
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,200
you buy it if you buy and it Herms out

813
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,519
your whole room I mean it says it right

814
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,440
there like yo this is untested gear like

815
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,319
this is what it is but hey it's it's $20

816
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,880
for a pack you know you got you're

817
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:21,158
running the risk you got to know and if

818
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,440
you're running plants you already know

819
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:24,320
you got to be watching this type of

820
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,080
stuff no matter what it could be it

821
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:27,480
could be uh you know Robin Hood seeds

822
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:29,199
which is untested or it could be his

823
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,759
other brands Square One genetics you

824
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,120
could be those plant too you still got

825
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:34,038
to watch cuz you never know what's going

826
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:35,798
to happen you know what I'm saying so

827
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:37,879
absolutely really good point and that's

828
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:40,599
where stability comes into the

829
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,120
conversation as well right what exactly

830
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:43,319
I feel like that term gets thrown around

831
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:44,719
and people a lot of people don't even

832
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:48,278
know what that they're what it actually

833
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,079
means truly what is meant by a strain or

834
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:52,240
a cultivar being stable there's a couple

835
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:54,639
ways to look at it so there's like

836
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,960
sexually stable so is it going to throw

837
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,519
bananas throw you know male flowers and

838
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,120
pollinate your uh the rest of your plans

839
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,679
so is it sexually stable and uh also

840
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,798
another way to look at is like

841
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:08,720
phenotypic expression how stable is that

842
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:10,158
you know some people at least back in

843
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,880
the day when stuff was created like

844
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,399
people wanted it to kind of just come

845
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:17,240
out and be like the same as is whatever

846
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:18,879
the picture was or whatever you know now

847
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,679
there's more variation with these poly

848
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,240
hybrids and stuff and a lot of people

849
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:23,440
want to kind of hunt their own and kind

850
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,120
of get that

851
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:30,000
variation okay so it's not so much the

852
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:31,599
stability and regards to you different

853
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,558
types of Herms right there's the Herms

854
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,519
with there nanners due to too much

855
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:37,839
stress and then there's Herms where it's

856
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,519
actually within the genetics to where

857
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,678
you grow it out it starts to flower and

858
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:44,960
you see pollen Sachs form at the nodes

859
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:48,360
right as far as being able to

860
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,840
genetically say quote breed those

861
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:53,918
characteristics out of the plant is that

862
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:55,720
actually a possibility at all or is

863
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,799
Herms always going to be within the

864
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,440
genetics no matter what is done I mean

865
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,839
well there's always going to be you know

866
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,360
life's going to find a way you know

867
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:07,398
that's how they preserve themselves but

868
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,638
goes back to like selecting plants and

869
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,439
you know working with plants that aren't

870
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:12,278
doing that so if it's fully Herman out

871
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,159
I'm not I'm not working with that plant

872
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:17,480
but if there's uh a lot of other plants

873
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:19,000
aren't you know and I'm running like a a

874
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,319
nice little number of them you can see

875
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,240
well okay that was like the problem

876
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:24,798
plant that might just be you know the

877
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,919
one off you know random one so you just

878
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,879
got to keep kind of running plants and

879
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,480
uh you know find the ones that don't you

880
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,600
can breed that out you know you got to

881
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,360
just keep selecting it but it's not

882
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,398
going to be ever completely gone cuz

883
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,359
this is this is how they preserve

884
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:39,000
themselves you know this is built into

885
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:41,278
the plant you know you can select and

886
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,159
select and try to breed away from it but

887
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:45,480
no matter what like it's going to be in

888
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:48,200
there you know cuz that's its survival

889
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,278
mechanism to uh you know reproduce if

890
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,038
there's no you know male pollen around

891
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:55,599
or whatever female reverse plants around

892
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:59,558
that are pollinating it so like it's

893
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:01,319
always something to watch out for but uh

894
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:03,158
yeah you can definitely breed it out it

895
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,558
just goes back to selecting plants

896
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:07,720
selecting the strong healthy vigorous

897
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:10,960
plants that aren't showing those uh

898
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,558
hermaphodite traits you know coming out

899
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,519
but uh it's always a risk no matter what

900
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:16,879
so whether it's like a $500 pack of the

901
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,638
hottest breeder in the game who's

902
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,880
running you know hundreds of plants and

903
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:23,199
and seeing what's going on still can

904
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,960
happen you know it's still going to

905
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,840
happen you got to watch so definitely

906
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,200
got to keep a close eye on it talking

907
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:30,000
about characteristics I kind of want to

908
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,679
get deeper into what characteristics you

909
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
look for When selecting par implants for

910
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:37,080
your breeding projects so obviously like

911
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,359
we want to cater to the market to you

912
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:41,319
know but we also want to be original

913
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,959
with what we like so it's like there's a

914
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:45,119
lot of hype cuts on the market there's a

915
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,798
lot of stuff always coming out but so

916
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:48,000
we're going to grow some of those things

917
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,679
but then like what's going to really

918
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,038
stay in our stable after that so you

919
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:55,000
know we're making our selections from U

920
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:57,480
you know some breeder Cuts but then also

921
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,398
seeds that are popped so for me it's

922
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,240
like you you know the tpin a big thing

923
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:04,319
is the tpin you know certain tpin you

924
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,880
know flower structure you know

925
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:09,038
internodal spacing you know stuff like

926
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,000
that how how much they root because if

927
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:12,558
you run a pheno hunt you'll see like

928
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,240
some plants will just suddenly just like

929
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:16,960
be so vigorous and just root out your

930
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,319
whole pot you know and some aren't

931
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,440
you're like oh that's a good candidate

932
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:21,960
but then you know the tpin aren't are

933
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,679
aren't really shown so it's like well

934
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,558
it's got the strong rooting it's got the

935
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,840
Vigor but it doesn't have the

936
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:30,359
tpin you know so uh I like selecting

937
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:33,240
plants with you know high turpine

938
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:35,199
content and uh a lot of stuff I like is

939
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,278
like gasier stuff I come from a time

940
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,120
where man we were getting those OG and

941
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:44,159
sour packs back in the day then like you

942
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:46,959
know like 350 400 $500 ounce stuff you

943
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,760
know and uh so I like I like a lot of

944
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,000
that and you know with the market right

945
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:54,359
now it's like candy gas is like huge I

946
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,200
like candy gas the grape gasoline we got

947
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:58,678
one of my favorites you know and I'm

948
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,159
going to keep Crossing that into stuff

949
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:01,880
I'm going to refine it like my black

950
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,000
cherry Bliss I'm going to refine that

951
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,519
have twos but then I'm still going to

952
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,519
take that grape gasoline cut and cross

953
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:08,320
it to other like hype stuff that I like

954
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:10,480
cuz it's like it's something I really

955
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,039
like I want to bring that you know to

956
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,000
the table for other people to experience

957
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:17,519
too and also taking stuff in directions

958
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,239
that other guys aren't taking it you

959
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:21,559
know like going back to the slurricane

960
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:23,039
example I'm not going to copy exactly

961
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,039
any cross they're doing I'm taking the

962
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:26,800
suane number seven in the direction that

963
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,480
I want to take it with the plants that I

964
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,519
like so you know the blue cookies the

965
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,960
grape gasoline just to name a couple of

966
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:37,878
them you know so flower structure I like

967
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:41,559
color but you know obviously bag appe

968
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:45,000
peels big for sure but uh overall just

969
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:46,639
you know tpin we want some dank tpin

970
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,159
coming out of these flowers you know

971
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,519
what I'm saying so that's a big one and

972
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,320
with all the new stuff that we're

973
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:55,079
refining like I'll be testing like uh

974
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,440
like the different fenos just to get an

975
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:59,200
idea of where the tpine levels are at

976
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,599
and the potencies and stuff like that

977
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:04,480
and then on my selected Keepers rerun

978
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:07,039
those whatever the top three and then

979
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,880
send those in for lab tests to see who's

980
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:12,639
scoring the highest but also the smoke

981
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,880
experience of people close to us so um

982
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:16,199
yeah those are some of the things I look

983
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,880
for and like I said it's it's like what

984
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:20,960
would you like like the permanent marker

985
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:23,079
it's a leaf Le 2023 strain of the Year

986
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,599
got a hold of it I wanted to grow it but

987
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:27,000
before I decided to make seeds with it I

988
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,760
wanted to make sure it was something

989
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,920
that I liked so you know ran it really

990
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,640
like I like that gassiness that comes in

991
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,920
so we like gas in our tpin so I'm

992
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:38,480
definitely going to make some seeds with

993
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:42,639
it you know what I'm saying so yeah

994
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,119
gassy tpin candy gas flower structure a

995
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,319
few main I was kind of going on a few

996
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:49,160
different ones that you can look for but

997
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,920
it's got to have some dang tpin man love

998
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:52,719
them

999
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,519
tpin so and that brings a you know the

1000
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:58,199
potency too CU it has a synergistic

1001
00:35:54,519 --> 00:36:01,199
effect so yeah I like my stuff taste

1002
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:03,199
good you know so huge Factor so it's

1003
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:06,439
somewhat of a rigorous process that you

1004
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:08,318
put your yourself through and to really

1005
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,280
find what you're looking for before

1006
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:12,039
you're comfortable releasing to the

1007
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,280
market so you mentioned testing several

1008
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:18,159
times you know testing aeno then running

1009
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:21,240
it again testing it again having uh

1010
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:23,239
people who around do smoke reports on it

1011
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:25,799
and stuff like that before you even

1012
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:26,959
consider releasing it and I really feel

1013
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,079
like a lot of people aren't really

1014
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,800
taking those steps to do that that

1015
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:32,079
they're just doing what we talked about

1016
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,839
in the beginning which is either Chuck

1017
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,839
and pollen or or just creating a cross

1018
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:39,480
and pushing it to Market with little to

1019
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:41,799
no testing and uh really going against

1020
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,719
everything in regards to ethics when it

1021
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,200
comes to breeding so I'm happy to sit

1022
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:46,679
down with you and really pull some of

1023
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:48,000
these things out of you and maybe this

1024
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:49,559
will inspire some of the Breeders and

1025
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,119
give some of the Breeders out there that

1026
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:53,440
are cut Corners give them some ideas for

1027
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:55,760
what they can do in order to kind of be

1028
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,400
more legit push things through testing

1029
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,880
you know not just tpine testing but h VD

1030
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,519
right hot plate and vroid make sure that

1031
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,559
you're not sending seeds out that have

1032
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:07,880
hot plate and vroid cuz yes hlvd can be

1033
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:09,719
in seeds I think a lot of people know

1034
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,559
that it can certainly be in seeds and

1035
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:14,118
that's unfortunately a lot of the ways

1036
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:17,440
that people's Gardens are being infected

1037
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:18,440
is through the seeds so and another

1038
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,679
another well I guess we're going to

1039
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,119
touch on one of those questions I was

1040
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:23,199
going to say but like the the Clone

1041
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,200
swapping you know that people do too you

1042
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:29,358
know and cl swapping uh clone swapping

1043
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:31,000
sorry cl cl swapping okay yeah let's get

1044
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:32,960
into that right now you're talking uh

1045
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,760
you me something you want to talk about

1046
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,880
kind of disease management is kind of

1047
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,319
what it relates to and talk all about

1048
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,440
that so you know a lot there's a lot of

1049
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:42,039
collectors out there and and a lot of

1050
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,000
smaller collectors which is awesome I

1051
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:45,719
love it I love it but then these people

1052
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,119
are you know swapping clones back hey

1053
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:48,919
man I'll trade you this for that and you

1054
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,838
know there's they got all the breeder

1055
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,318
Cuts they got a list of 50 of them but

1056
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:54,078
it's like you don't know they uh

1057
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:57,599
standard operating procedures for

1058
00:37:54,079 --> 00:38:00,000
keeping plants uh clean and uninfected

1059
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,599
and all that so like these people are

1060
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,838
passing them around and a lot of these

1061
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,720
Growers won't even know like that they

1062
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:07,199
even have it and then they're swapping

1063
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:08,879
it with another guy who's swapping with

1064
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:10,719
another guy and then all these genetics

1065
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,480
are getting swapped around and you're

1066
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:14,318
getting all that grower problem when you

1067
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,318
get that clone that's why we try to go

1068
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:18,400
straight to the top to like a verified

1069
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:20,480
tissue culture Nursery you know the

1070
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,599
breeder you know like close uh

1071
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,039
connections we've made you know cuz I

1072
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:26,440
get people all the time you know hitting

1073
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:28,000
me up like hey uh well I got this I got

1074
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,000
these would you be down to trade I got

1075
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
the sh Banger 22 you know all the hype

1076
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,960
reader stuff that's going around and

1077
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,480
it's like no no I I can't ever do that

1078
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,199
cuz like I said don't know if it's

1079
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,480
verified I really don't know you like

1080
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:41,039
that I don't know your Sops you're just

1081
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,079
swapping stuff around you're not paying

1082
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:45,400
to get your plants tested it can be kind

1083
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:48,400
of expensive if you're like getting you

1084
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,160
know a bunch of plants tested so like

1085
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,559
there's a lot of that and to be very

1086
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:53,960
wary of that cuz you know there's a lot

1087
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:55,679
of that going on you might not even know

1088
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,079
and now you infected your other plants

1089
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:59,118
that you kept around and now you send it

1090
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:01,318
to your bu and uh it's infected and this

1091
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,160
is just going all over the United States

1092
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:05,318
and it's infecting people's Gardens and

1093
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:07,239
you know lower yields you know and and

1094
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:08,199
just uh lower plant Health you know

1095
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:12,078
lower

1096
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:13,799
tpin so it's it's definitely an issue

1097
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,720
that uh we all need more be more

1098
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,160
Vigilant on you know ask more questions

1099
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:18,719
go back to the asking questions same

1100
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:21,199
with the Clones like hey what's up lab

1101
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:22,519
reports you know so like uh we have lab

1102
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:24,439
reports on some of our Cuts we're about

1103
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:26,838
to have our whole spring menu tested

1104
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,720
plus our our original mother stock we

1105
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:30,078
have like you know mother stock that's

1106
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:32,000
segregated from the new additions that

1107
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,760
are going to drop going to you know test

1108
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,400
all those but uh yeah man so you got to

1109
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,400
be careful out there CU for me at least

1110
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,800
like now it's getting to the point where

1111
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,000
it's like man this my collection is

1112
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,839
worth like a nice a pretty penny I would

1113
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,159
say and this is my livelihood and this

1114
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:49,119
is what I need to to further create more

1115
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:51,679
genetics so it's like yo this no I got

1116
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,519
protect it at all cost so like the way I

1117
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:55,838
treat it and the way facilities treat it

1118
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,920
and the way people are really doing it

1119
00:39:55,838 --> 00:39:59,838
is uh not the way everyone's doing it

1120
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,358
like the common hom grower common you

1121
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:06,000
know clone holder you know genetic

1122
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:09,719
collector however you want to call it so

1123
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,920
that's an issue for sure be wary of it

1124
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:13,078
and don't lose your collection to I made

1125
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,440
a post don't lose your collection to

1126
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:17,599
Carl the Clone seller or Haley hop Lon

1127
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,760
don't want to do it you don't want to do

1128
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,280
it I've had to refuse so many clones

1129
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,960
over the years and you know the people

1130
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,400
offering the Clones to me it comes out

1131
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,079
of good heart right they just want to

1132
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,519
share their genetics but it goes back to

1133
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,000
me not knowing like what their grow even

1134
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:34,800
looks like you know is is there pest in

1135
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,838
the grow did they have powdery Mill do

1136
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,000
you know is there any type of disease or

1137
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:42,679
pathogen so I have had to decline

1138
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,920
accepting any clones over the several

1139
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:46,879
years I mean I've accepted in the past

1140
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,880
and and took a risk back before I really

1141
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,760
even knew about all the risks that are

1142
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,599
involved with this yeah me too in the

1143
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,960
early beginning you know and then you

1144
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,559
start getting more like okay now I can't

1145
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,838
L I can't afford to cultivars I have

1146
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:02,480
like nuh you know if you have a special

1147
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:04,318
chill out OG that you want to like work

1148
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,039
further you don't want to lose that you

1149
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:07,599
don't want that to get infected man you

1150
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:10,880
know that's your

1151
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:13,119
livelihood so exactly yeah it's risky

1152
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,160
it's very very risky and even the seeds

1153
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,318
I remember I was at MJ Biz and there was

1154
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:19,159
a guy who was just handing out packs of

1155
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:20,519
seeds he was just walking randomly

1156
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:23,239
walking up to people here want some

1157
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:25,759
seeds to next J next a couple my buddies

1158
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:27,078
took them I you know he handed it to me

1159
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,040
I just hand it over to my buddy I'm like

1160
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:31,400
I'm just don't even want in my garden

1161
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:33,239
cuz you you have no idea if this hot PL

1162
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,720
and viroid in those seats or not maybe

1163
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:36,239
if the guy like stopped me and had a

1164
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:37,879
conversation and explained a little bit

1165
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:39,679
more about it and and you know the

1166
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,119
practices he did and so on and so forth

1167
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:43,598
they'd be more comfortable accepting

1168
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,920
that but for the most part these days if

1169
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,800
I don't know what the source is if I

1170
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,920
don't know you know what the card looks

1171
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,039
like I'm most likely not going to be

1172
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:54,838
accepting any clones or seeds from

1173
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:56,519
really untrusted sources is what I'd say

1174
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:58,799
CU he could just be the poen chucker guy

1175
00:41:56,519 --> 00:42:00,679
you just like you know know you just he

1176
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,359
just chucked it all over he doesn't he

1177
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:05,519
just handing them out he just go you

1178
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:06,639
know you don't know you don't know so

1179
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:08,318
maybe it's just because he's a small

1180
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:11,118
scale guy trying to get his name out

1181
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:13,400
there there's that understand a lot of

1182
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,519
challenges that small scale breeders

1183
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,280
face in this industry right you know

1184
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:20,358
this industry sometimes prioritizes big

1185
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,240
names and commercialized genetics right

1186
00:42:20,358 --> 00:42:23,679
talk to us about those challenges well

1187
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,239
yeah we're like I was kind of touching

1188
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:26,558
on earlier you know we're competing with

1189
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:29,159
some of these guys who have like just

1190
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,920
Mega facilities you know they're they're

1191
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:34,078
they're cranking out these seed lines

1192
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:37,559
like crazy so it's like you know uh real

1193
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:40,440
estate having the the space you know and

1194
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:42,640
cuz you know too if you're making seeds

1195
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:46,240
well you're not producing in there it's

1196
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:48,759
seeds you know if you uh got mother sack

1197
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:50,199
well that those nutrients and that light

1198
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:53,720
and everything that's not going to

1199
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:55,759
producing stuff you know so there's a a

1200
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:57,838
lot of money that goes into it you know

1201
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,280
to like get the genetics to the people

1202
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:01,239
you know there's a lot of sacrifice that

1203
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,720
you got to make for for the space that

1204
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:04,358
you do the limited space that you do

1205
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:06,598
have because it comes down to limited

1206
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:08,279
space you know uh not having the

1207
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:10,838
licensing to have like you know huge

1208
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,920
facilities huge plant counts all that so

1209
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:15,519
you have to go around it a certain way

1210
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,599
in order to make it happen and uh these

1211
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:19,440
guys like I said are cranking it out so

1212
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,359
it's like we're only going to be able to

1213
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,920
release so many per year cuz like I want

1214
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:24,440
to do it right you know like I'm going

1215
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,039
to have to get some out to some people

1216
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,280
and grow them out myself make sure

1217
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:30,039
they're not herming out all that it's

1218
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,000
like we're not g to be able to drop you

1219
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:33,519
know lines like that and like I was

1220
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,440
telling you earlier it doesn't matter if

1221
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:36,880
you worked on it for this long or for

1222
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,039
years it doesn't guarantee that those

1223
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,079
seeds are going to sell well all that so

1224
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:43,838
all that time money and energy went to

1225
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:47,200
really what you know and uh so there's a

1226
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:49,480
lot of sacrifices uh we make and and for

1227
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:51,480
the people doing it you know more power

1228
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:54,199
to you it because I I know the struggle

1229
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,000
of it so but I also like that it's like

1230
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:57,799
you know it's it's touched by me it's

1231
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,599
like what I want to bring to the table

1232
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,960
what I truly like when some of these

1233
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,318
guys are just pumping them out like I

1234
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,318
say it's just kind of a numbers game

1235
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:06,039
they're just okay what's okay PR Mark

1236
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:07,838
came out okay this game sure Banger 22

1237
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:09,920
okay boom boom boom just pollinate a

1238
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:12,119
bunch of stuff all right let's run a 100

1239
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,440
of each okay this one's Herm we're not

1240
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:16,519
getting that one okay we're going to

1241
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,920
release these six crosses D well in

1242
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:20,838
order for us to get to that point it's

1243
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,800
like a lot more you know a lot more time

1244
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:25,960
and effort to to get to it so you know

1245
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,720
support those support those people cuz

1246
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,079
like you know we're pouring our pass to

1247
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:32,759
this it's like it's like you know you

1248
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,599
got to you got to you know follow their

1249
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,920
story and like their selections it's

1250
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:37,318
like more than just like the brand

1251
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,880
because it almost like takes on a life

1252
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:40,159
its own once you're at that point and

1253
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,039
it's like like I said almost

1254
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:43,519
corporatized where you're just looking

1255
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:44,639
at numbers on a sheet okay well we're

1256
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:46,079
going to do the permanent Mark times

1257
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:48,879
this this sold well last so we're going

1258
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:51,200
to do this with that da D and yeah

1259
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,760
that's cool and all but like you know it

1260
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:55,358
kind of strips away some of the passion

1261
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,400
I feel or like some of the genuiness

1262
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:59,159
that can that like what I what I'm

1263
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,920
offering or what uh other breeders are

1264
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:02,358
offering like yourself and and other

1265
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,358
guys who are just pouring their heart

1266
00:45:02,358 --> 00:45:06,519
into this you know what I'm saying like

1267
00:45:04,358 --> 00:45:09,279
this is our Obsession like for me this

1268
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:12,039
is my therapy my obsession this is what

1269
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,720
helps keep me grounded I love it I'm not

1270
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:16,279
going nowhere and I'm going keep uh

1271
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:17,519
forging uh those networks cuz like even

1272
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,680
in the beginning man you know you have

1273
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:21,880
some push back you know from your own

1274
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:23,558
your own mind your own doubt your own

1275
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,000
worry and then even people around you

1276
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:26,480
well aren't you going to need this well

1277
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,199
like well this dude he's got this and

1278
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,960
that how are you going to why didn't

1279
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:31,960
listen to know that I just kept pushing

1280
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,480
forward and expanding and going and

1281
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,880
going and you know what I'm looking back

1282
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,318
now and I'm like I'm so glad I didn't

1283
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,400
listen to No One I'm so glad you know

1284
00:45:39,318 --> 00:45:44,400
I've taken this journey and uh you know

1285
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:48,280
I was like I said I was working in a

1286
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,160
warehouse and uh I quit I quit uh it's

1287
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:53,040
not even a year ago coming up on a year

1288
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:54,480
but basically I just felt it in my gut

1289
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:57,039
man it was just like I was still doing

1290
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,199
it on the side you know but I was like

1291
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:00,800
missing out on opportunity because I'm

1292
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:02,838
rushing around all day to try to make

1293
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,960
sure everything's great and uh taken

1294
00:46:02,838 --> 00:46:06,318
care of before I go to work then I get

1295
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,358
off work work till like 3:00 in the

1296
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:09,558
morning I was working 3:00 to 11:00 p.m.

1297
00:46:08,358 --> 00:46:12,239
so then I'm working till like 3:00 in

1298
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:15,400
the morning doing plant stuff got to get

1299
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:17,519
up cuz I got kids 7 in the morning and

1300
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,079
man it was just getting so to be too

1301
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:21,318
much and then sometimes mother stock

1302
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,519
like Mother Health would suffer because

1303
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:24,318
I'm rushing around I'm trying to do too

1304
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:26,159
much I'm trying to do too much oh well

1305
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:27,880
now I can't cut clones off of her well

1306
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:30,118
now someone's hit me for clones now I'm

1307
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,599
missing out on that opportunity and you

1308
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:33,200
know these warehouses don't pay that

1309
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,440
much I don't have to really say for you

1310
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:37,519
to get the idea so I'm like man if I

1311
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,200
just put my full effort and attention

1312
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:40,639
into this I know I can make that money

1313
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,078
because I'm missing out on money because

1314
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:46,639
I'm here at this place maybe clearing

1315
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:49,400
$100 a day after taxes so it was like a

1316
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:51,118
huge leap of faith and just you know I

1317
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,800
felt it was right and you know looking

1318
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,358
back now I'm glad I did it hasn't been

1319
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,160
all glamorous it hasn't been all pretty

1320
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,759
it hasn't been all perfect there's ups

1321
00:46:57,159 --> 00:47:01,759
and downs you know money goes back into

1322
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,640
the business you know I just got a bunch

1323
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,720
of graphic design done more labels that

1324
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:07,118
was like almost $800 you know like so

1325
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:10,239
there's a lot of money that goes into

1326
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:13,640
the testing you know uh having grows for

1327
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:15,639
testing your stuff you know all that so

1328
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:17,558
a lot of money that goes into it to to

1329
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:19,318
make it all possible but I wouldn't have

1330
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:21,680
it any other way I'm in controling my

1331
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:23,480
destiny you know I got like I said I got

1332
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:26,480
chickens you know I got my own chickens

1333
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:30,679
I got my own garden Tomatoes all that

1334
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:32,119
going to be canning my own Foods so yeah

1335
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:33,799
I'm just uh grateful to be on this

1336
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:37,039
journey I'm grateful to be here talking

1337
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:40,400
to you man very up it is really you know

1338
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:41,960
so much work to do all of it and you

1339
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,440
really it really has to be a passion in

1340
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,679
order if you to prevere and and keep

1341
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:48,838
going and get it done as you know I have

1342
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:50,960
a cross called chill out OG and I

1343
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:53,719
started back in 2019 and this is the

1344
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,240
only cross I've ever had you know it's a

1345
00:47:53,719 --> 00:47:57,118
something I've been working on for

1346
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:58,959
several years and it's a little bit more

1347
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,039
difficult for me cuz I'm a small hom

1348
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,358
grower I have a plant count I have to

1349
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:05,639
stay within so I've done hunts where I

1350
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:07,358
threw away everything I didn't like

1351
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:09,759
anything it wasn't what I was looking

1352
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:12,519
for and then the next grow nailed it

1353
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,119
right but you know grow takes 4 months

1354
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:16,599
or something like that you know roughly

1355
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:18,960
four months in order to complete so it

1356
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:21,318
takes a very long time I'm all the way

1357
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,679
down F3 now and really I probably could

1358
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:26,358
be on F4 or F5 now but I'm picky you

1359
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:28,440
know it's a I'm waiting to get what I'm

1360
00:48:26,358 --> 00:48:30,558
looking what I know is in the genetics

1361
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,280
that I'm looking to pull out and bring

1362
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:37,920
down to that F4 level so it takes a lot

1363
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:40,400
of patience and uh a I commend you for

1364
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,519
for going through it man and I think I

1365
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,400
think when you make your next uh filial

1366
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:46,280
generation you should throw a couple

1367
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,119
other plants in there man like all right

1368
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,519
well here's my refined chill out OG G

1369
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:51,358
but I also have chill out OG G to the

1370
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,639
grape gasoline or the trop cherry and

1371
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:56,960
you offer a couple more and I think

1372
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:59,118
there's definite value in that and also

1373
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,720
like you like mixing in the land race

1374
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,200
genetics to it like I like that too like

1375
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:05,118
there's some guys in the midwest here

1376
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:06,358
killing it with like land R stuff and

1377
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,200
like I want to like work with them to

1378
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:11,239
kind of get something like that too you

1379
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:13,358
know like uh a breeder Khalifa genetics

1380
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:16,759
he's got like some ibls like lemon

1381
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:18,798
Afghan like an true IBL land race so

1382
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,400
like that' be a great one for you too

1383
00:49:18,798 --> 00:49:21,759
honestly you know but you got your

1384
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,880
Pakistan Valley in there which is kind

1385
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,359
of a similar thing pure Inda right so

1386
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,079
yeah so like I want to work something

1387
00:49:26,358 --> 00:49:30,798
like that into the genetics too but yeah

1388
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:32,680
man it's a lot of work and you have all

1389
00:49:30,798 --> 00:49:35,358
those mixed fenos you know even if

1390
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:37,318
you're gifting out the product you know

1391
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:39,159
not it's not always ideal when you have

1392
00:49:37,318 --> 00:49:40,960
all these mixed fenos and like yeah well

1393
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:43,558
this one has no smell to it and this one

1394
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,318
you know so yeah you're you're spending

1395
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:47,240
all that time and it's like now you got

1396
00:49:45,318 --> 00:49:49,199
some smoke that you particularly might

1397
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:50,598
not you know prefer or it's decent but

1398
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:53,399
it's just not hitting the mark like if

1399
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:55,119
you filled it with like a breeder cut

1400
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,519
that you know is going to perform and

1401
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,640
give you the potency yield and and the

1402
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:01,639
tpin are after but it's like instead

1403
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:03,239
you're putting that into your breeding

1404
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:04,838
projects where it's like you're not

1405
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:07,679
trying to yield probably you know you're

1406
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:10,078
just trying to see expressions and and

1407
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:11,719
uh yeah so all the money and time that

1408
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,200
goes into that you know it's it's

1409
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:16,078
definitely a lot of work it is it is a

1410
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:17,679
lot of work is not for the fainthearted

1411
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,160
you do got to like have some true

1412
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:23,318
passion in order to pursue this straight

1413
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:25,598
up so I completely agree now there are a

1414
00:50:23,318 --> 00:50:27,679
lot of folks that are getting into

1415
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:30,240
breeding right they brand new maybe

1416
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:32,358
they're doing their first Cross or maybe

1417
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,439
they have a cross already and now

1418
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:36,679
they're working on more what advice do

1419
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,318
you have for those who are on their

1420
00:50:36,679 --> 00:50:41,519
first or second round of breeding man I

1421
00:50:39,318 --> 00:50:43,759
would say uh just just build that

1422
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:45,000
experience because it's like uh you know

1423
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,000
when you cross something you might be

1424
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,679
like wow well this plant dominated the

1425
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,920
cross wow well you know I'm going to use

1426
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:52,598
this with this then cuz if I want that

1427
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,119
to come through well the genetics aren't

1428
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:55,640
going to mix the same it might be the

1429
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:58,400
opposite now when you cross it to that

1430
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:59,679
plant so it's like uh you know stuff

1431
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,480
like that just get the experience just

1432
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:03,919
keep going keep running plants cuz you

1433
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,318
know that's what gets you better that's

1434
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,599
what gets you the point where you kind

1435
00:51:05,318 --> 00:51:08,079
of know what you're talking about and

1436
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:10,519
kind of know what's going on with the

1437
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,359
genetics and knowing the plants you're

1438
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:14,079
working with you know like I said like

1439
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:15,358
just cuz permanent Mark is hot do

1440
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,240
doesn't mean you should just get it and

1441
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:19,639
pollinate it if anything get it grow it

1442
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:20,798
you're going to be way behind these guys

1443
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:23,000
who are pumping out the seed lines

1444
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:25,280
that's another struggle you know like

1445
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,440
getting that cross out you know right

1446
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,960
away like it ain't going to happen but

1447
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,880
you know cross it and or grow it out see

1448
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,440
if you like it you like it okay well I

1449
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,920
like what this brings to the table I

1450
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,639
know what this plant does what it's like

1451
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,280
so now you kind of know what to expect

1452
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:41,879
you know so definitely know your parent

1453
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,599
plants you know cuz that's something

1454
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,079
that a lot of people don't always do you

1455
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,000
know so they don't know like what are

1456
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:48,798
they looking at or if they like it or oh

1457
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,199
does this one lean this way so knowing

1458
00:51:48,798 --> 00:51:54,318
your parent plants is huge and uh go

1459
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:55,759
with your heart man you know like I

1460
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:58,000
understand we got to keep the lights on

1461
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,440
and stuff so like I said Focus your

1462
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,920
attention on certain things but you know

1463
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:06,838
make some other stuff and and just keep

1464
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:08,880
growing man just keep growing keep keep

1465
00:52:06,838 --> 00:52:10,558
experimenting and don't ever think you

1466
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,960
know it all cuz I feel like with this

1467
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:16,280
you can just keep going it's like never

1468
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:18,000
ending but uh and be transparent be

1469
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,040
genuine cuz that'll shine through

1470
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,639
that'll shine through man so be genuine

1471
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:23,679
transparent go in the direction that you

1472
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:25,279
want like like we're going to be making

1473
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:26,960
hype stuff and Crossing hype stuff but

1474
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,480
we're taking it with the cuts we like

1475
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,920
directions we want to take and uh for

1476
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,838
the most part stuff that that hasn't

1477
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:36,119
been made yet you know

1478
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:37,558
so yeah that's a couple things I can say

1479
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,000
think that's a lot of good advice and

1480
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:40,920
really a lot of good information this

1481
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,358
whole episode you know this is something

1482
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:46,280
that uh we haven't really talked about

1483
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:47,719
in this podcast ethics you know some of

1484
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,559
