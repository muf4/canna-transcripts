1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,819
what's up everybody feel that don't

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,230
normally my name is Chris aka mr.

3
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:07,048
guerrard and you're watching extras

4
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,638
channel this is the minger 600 led grill

5
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,980
light I purchased this girl light off of

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,869
Amazon at a discount in this video I'm

7
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,240
going to unbox the unit I'll do a quick

8
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:16,769
walkthrough of the app that is used to

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,750
control the light and I'll test the

10
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:20,850
power output first thing out of the box

11
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,550
is the antenna according to the product

12
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,279
listing page the Bluetooth range is 15

13
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,949
meters which is about 49 feet next out

14
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:31,500
the box is a power cord this is 6 feet

15
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:35,370
long it comes with a set of wire hangers

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,960
and a user manual here is the LED grow

17
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:39,628
light I won't go over all the features

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,100
in this video but I will leave a link in

19
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:42,599
the description section below so you can

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,160
click on it and you can learn about all

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,020
the details on this girl light

22
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,609
I've hung the light on one side of a 2

23
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,440
foot by 4 foot Croton

24
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:51,299
unfortunately the wire hanging kit that

25
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,289
comes with this girl light is a single

26
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:54,029
style hanger

27
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,800
this results in difficulty in hanging

28
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,239
the grow lights straight so I highly

29
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,189
recommend picking up a pair of light

30
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:01,049
ratchet hangers and then you can do what

31
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:02,939
I've done here which is remove the hook

32
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:04,859
that comes with it and connect the wire

33
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:06,868
hangers directly to the light ratchets

34
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:08,728
this makes it much easier to hang the

35
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:10,829
grow light straight now let's do a quick

36
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:13,829
walkthrough of the app the name of the

37
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:16,228
app is gouf home and it is available on

38
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,179
Android and iOS once you get into the

39
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:19,739
app click the icon on the top right

40
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,479
corner and you can add in the device

41
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,399
I've actually already added in the

42
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,618
device as you can see here so I'll tap

43
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,118
on this device it takes a few seconds to

44
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:29,549
connect to the grow light and then this

45
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,739
is what you see you can actually set two

46
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,079
different timers and then you have the

47
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,328
option of three different spectrums in

48
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,978
order to enable the timers you would tap

49
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:40,500
the slider and then you would tap the

50
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:42,989
time spots and adjust the on and off

51
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,509
times for the spectrums they have three

52
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:47,250
different options for one six one and

53
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,409
eight one and the manufacturer

54
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,780
recommends these different spectrums for

55
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,909
different growing stages I plug the unit

56
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,159
into my kilowatt meter just to see what

57
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,290
the wattage draw is on this unit on the

58
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,630
for one setting it pulls about one

59
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,060
hundred six hundred seven watts on the

60
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:04,938
six one setting it pulls in ninety eight

61
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,920
watts

62
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:12,719
and on the eighth one setting it pulls

63
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:16,020
94 watts now let's jump into the power

64
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,639
measurements I'm using the apogee mq 500

65
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,969
power meter and then speed are measures

66
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:23,519
from 389 nanometers to 692 nanometers

67
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:25,139
plus or minus 5 nanometers so there's

68
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,060
any light being emitted outside of that

69
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,949
range it won't be shown on this meter

70
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,900
and this is just to give you a general

71
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:32,310
idea of what the power output is this

72
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,319
isn't meant to be exact

73
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,840
the reflective walls in this grow tent

74
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,560
could increase the numbers so just keep

75
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,479
that in mind

76
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,189
it doesn't say what the coverage area is

77
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,409
for this girl light however from my

78
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:45,989
experience this size grow light is best

79
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:47,729
for a 2 foot by 2 foot grow space like I

80
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:49,620
mentioned earlier I've hung this light

81
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:51,359
on one side of a 2 foot by 4 foot grow

82
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,239
tent and I'll try to keep my par meter

83
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,709
within a 2 foot by 2 foot grow space all

84
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,580
right I'll let the measurements do the

85
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:01,319
talking

let me know in the comment section below
