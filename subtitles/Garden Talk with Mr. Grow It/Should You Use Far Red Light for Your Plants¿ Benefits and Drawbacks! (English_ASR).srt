1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,040
can you talk to us with a far red light

2
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:06,639
specifically between 700 and 750

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,839
nanometers what does it do to the plant

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:12,120
and then also is it worth supplementing

5
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:14,359
far red light or do most grow lights

6
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:17,038
have enough far red that it's not worth

7
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:19,679
supplementing well it's uh this is

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,400
something that uh this is like the

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,039
something i' I've been hearing about for

10
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:26,358
10 years but once again still is ever

11
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,279
evolving it's it's uh it's funny we had

12
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,920
a we recorded an episode of The Jug

13
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:33,878
dealers podcast the other day and uh I I

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,559
happen to know once again I I've been in

15
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:38,640
the world I've watched certain people

16
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:39,679
use far red to effective results for the

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,079
most part and then I'm talking with

18
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:45,840
these guy here the jiren and Gabe two my

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,280
most like respected grow brains in all

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,879
the thing and they both look me in the

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,600
eye and they're like you're wrong and I

22
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,039
go bro well I was like I thought they

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,439
were gonna be yeah of course the flower

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,679
initiation that stuff works and they're

25
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:58,198
like no doesn't do anything doesn't

26
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,159
exist in nature I'm like who so this

27
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:01,759
controver you know this goes deep like

28
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,639
this is one of the those controversial

29
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,560
things there's the there's the red and

30
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,359
there's the UV we'll get to I find that

31
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,000
to be not since organic vers sythetic

32
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:13,319
have we had as much debate in the

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,640
growing community and so as far as the

34
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,118
far red some people can be confused

35
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,840
right off the bat so we should probably

36
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:23,359
clarify that I mentioned the red earlier

37
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,000
as as the IR the infrared and so when uh

38
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:29,000
as grow mentioned the par when you see a

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,640
par chart it's what does a plant see

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,078
think of it like the VIS visual spectrum

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,118
of a human right we don't see X-rays and

42
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:37,478
gamma rays we don't see microwaves and

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,759
radio waves but we see visible light

44
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:40,798
same sort of thing with the plant it's

45
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,920
got a visual spectrum that it can see

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,360
but just the same way as x-rays Shores

47
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,439
hell affect us if we're bombarded with

48
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,280
them same thing things outside of the

49
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,959
par range also affect the plant and so

50
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,439
uh infrared is outside of that par range

51
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,759
way outside of it and so it it's uh like

52
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,559
I said that's why it's interesting it's

53
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,840
like oh it's outside of par yet it still

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,759
does affect the metabolism the plant

55
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,478
there's also that's infrared now we're

56
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,000
discussing far red so that is slightly

57
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:09,719
on the end it's just dipping over the

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,959
side of the par range a little bit in

59
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:16,199
little bit out and it does quite a bit

60
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,400
of sort of stuff uh a lot of negative

61
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,560
stuff as well as positive one of the

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,239
main things that uh I think as I can

63
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,800
speak is you know there's there's not a

64
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,239
ton of science science out there as as

65
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,200
far as this stuff once again it's a lot

66
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,560
of the companies and I trust a lot of

67
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,479
the companies sh from migro I trust this

68
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,640
guy you know I there's certain

69
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,679
characters out there Jer from the Dutch

70
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:41,318
lighting Innovations I trust him so when

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,800
these guy says things I listen and so we

72
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:46,039
can start with uh the negative sort of

73
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,200
effects that the far red will have so

74
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:50,598
far red is a just like if you can think

75
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:53,199
like the reason the x-rays are so

76
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:55,039
powerful is they're a really small wave

77
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,719
they're very intense it takes a lot of

78
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,400
energy like if I want to make something

79
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,919
like jiggle fast I got to put a lot of

80
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,158
energy with it and so versus a radio

81
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:06,639
wave right it's this giant huge thing it

82
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:09,000
can wrap over your house and still get a

83
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,238
signal on the next one whereas if I shot

84
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
you know an x-ray burst at your house

85
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,840
it's G to hit the wall it can't go over

86
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,519
it it's too small of a wavelength and so

87
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,759
you can think of the the uh the far red

88
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:22,759
kind of like that it's a bigger thing so

89
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,759
it can get past your canopy it can get

90
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:28,239
past your leaves it can get down lower

91
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,639
so if you have a forest and you got a

92
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,000
bunch of trees that are shad out a plant

93
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,878
a little plant that's trying to grow

94
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,080
down there our our little favorite High

95
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:38,598
valued plants that we like to grow if we

96
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,840
put that underneath a giant forest

97
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:42,759
canopy right it's not going to get any

98
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,360
of that that delicious par that we're

99
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:46,878
talking about but what it is going to

100
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,599
get is some of that far red because it

101
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,359
can get through the canopy and it still

102
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:53,839
hit it and what that tells the plant is

103
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,599
stretch baby stretch you're not getting

104
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,680
any of the yummy light that we need to

105
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,238
grow we're getting all that red light

106
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,680
and that means that there's light above

107
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,079
us but we ain't getting it so we got to

108
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,120
grow up there so one of the things that

109
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:10,079
I've seen a lot is people that will uh

110
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,158
use uh their far red lights all cycle is

111
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,159
that they're getting a lot of stretch

112
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:16,918
now some people like the stretch this is

113
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:18,478
a interesting thing of uh at the the 58

114
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,798
jug dealers guys we like to say it's

115
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,800
it's like think of a like a bloom

116
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,918
booster right is like an additive right

117
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,560
it's not it's not required it's just

118
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:30,038
it's going to get you farther I think of

119
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,560
like the these UV the the the far rad

120
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:33,120
things like that that these are the the

121
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,399
additives that we're adding and some

122
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,519
genetics need more calag that's where it

123
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:39,959
came from some need less some need so

124
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,000
same thing some genetics some cultivars

125
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:43,478
as we're now calling them they uh or

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,199
should probably should have always been

127
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:48,079
calling them strains are for mushrooms

128
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,840
and and flues cultivars are for plants

129
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,599
just to clear up any we still call it

130
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:55,119
strains we can still say it no one's

131
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,800
don't don't be a Snicker puss don't

132
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,199
don't talk down to someone because they

133
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,800
say strain we get it C you know but some

134
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,919
of these of ours they uh they need more

135
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,520
than others and so if you got like these

136
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,758
little tiny squat plants that you want

137
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:10,560
to grow up maybe you you have techniques

138
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,360
for increasing that that inner noal

139
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,120
spacing one of the things the reasons we

140
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,160
don't like stretching is because it

141
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,120
takes no to node of those those flower

142
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,680
sites it increases it and then you get

143
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,079
these giant topheavy things that want to

144
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,720
bend and break and you're having to give

145
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:27,038
them more silic so that way they have a

146
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,840
little bit more elasticity to them and

147
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,719
everything just gets changed so if

148
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:32,879
you're one of these like highlevel

149
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,800
thinking Growers like my buddy from

150
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,159
threes genetics JLS monster he's one of

151
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,600
one of the best breeders in Colorado and

152
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,000
he was like I like I run my far red

153
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,039
midcycle I I like a little stretch like

154
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,918
he'll grow these this Colonel chem that

155
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:50,159
I love I I got some of it sitting over

156
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:52,519
here and man amazing he's like it's to

157
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,960
squat the nose are two together I I

158
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,399
sometimes I get Bud

159
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:58,198
mold okay I would have never thought

160
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,959
like okay maybe this guy wants dress

161
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,319
because he's he's getting Bettis at the

162
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,439
end of his Harvest he's like this

163
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,360
loosens up some of those tight flower

164
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:09,038
sights and okay I'm learning holy crap

165
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,400
here's another thing I would have been

166
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:14,159
like that's bad I could say that's bad

167
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,959
don't stretching as B is it not if

168
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,960
that's exactly what you want to keep

169
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:21,680
your plants that keep you happy and

170
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:24,120
healthy happy and healthy so uh on the

171
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,478
positive side of it is the flower

172
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,879
initiation this one my friends have

173
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,079
legit been doing forever you can think

174
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,759
of it just like I talked about with how

175
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:36,680
red are these big giant things well

176
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,879
before our eyes can actually see the

177
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,560
sunrise we're actually starting to get

178
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,680
bombarded that's why it starts to heat

179
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,918
up a little bit before the sun even

180
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,879
comes up we're getting hit with that IR

181
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:48,758
first it's the biggest it's coming down

182
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,399
it's cooking up our atmosphere and then

183
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:53,120
that far red is coming in and so even

184
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:55,719
though the sun hasn't crested the

185
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,478
horizon yet it's still throwing some of

186
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,440
that far red that our eyes can't

187
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:03,279
necessarily even see but the plants can

188
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:04,918
and that tells them to wake up same

189
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,719
conversely when the Sun starts to go

190
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:09,639
down it crosses the Horizon and then all

191
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,280
that visible light is blocked by the

192
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,639
horizon yet some of that red is still so

193
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:16,198
big just like the x-rays hitting your

194
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,000
house versus the radio hit in your house

195
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,000
you can hit the radio in a big city even

196
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,680
though it's blocked it it your plant

197
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,319
sees ah there's that outgoing red time

198
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,478
to go to sleep so people have called

199
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,319
this the flower initiator you'll run it

200
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:31,800
for 15 minutes before your lights turn

201
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:35,479
on and 15 minutes after your lights turn

202
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,879
on this tells them that it is fully time

203
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:39,359
to wake up and fully time to go to bed

204
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,560
and they will go it takes your plants

205
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,720
you know an hour to se I I once again

206
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,879
cultivar specific some some plants go to

207
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,039
sleep very very fast and some other take

208
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,080
forever just like people it's almost

209
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:53,719
like life is like life you know they're

210
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:55,878
so much like us it's it's almost spooky

211
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,319
and so it will tell them wake up go to

212
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,000
bed and they go faster and then so

213
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,479
they're they're able to produce sugars

214
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,720
and oxin at night and interchange with

215
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,719
the roots the the roots and the the

216
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,440
chotes as we call them they both are

217
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,240
doing different roles one's creating

218
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:12,759
oxygen people always think that the

219
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,918
plants well they create CO2 well did you

220
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,439
know the roots create oxygen that's why

221
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:19,918
terrariums can exist blew my mind when I

222
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,839
star you can put a plant in a sealed

223
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:26,000
bottle and it will live because its

224
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:28,119
roots are producing oxygen and it's uh

225
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,038
flowers are producing CO2 and it can

226
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,839
circulate through the two blew my mind

227
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,598
and so if you start shortening those

228
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,959
days or not shortening your days but

229
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,158
getting them to go to sleep faster

230
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:41,158
you're actually day after day in a you

231
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,918
know a 60 to 80 Day flower cycle you're

232
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:45,039
actually pulling several days off some

233
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:47,199
people are saying I'm pulling a week off

234
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,799
of my plants this is the point I tried

235
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,399
to make with jiren and Gabe on The Jug

236
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,719
dealers show is where they're like no it

237
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,639
doesn't do anything and I was like I

238
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,080
think we're talking quality I don't

239
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,240
think it does anything to increase

240
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,519
quality you're not going to get more oil

241
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,320
and those voc's from this but you're

242
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,839
taking time off of your schedule so it's

243
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,519
more I guess this could be lumped into

244
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,959
the yield category because if you can

245
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:11,000
jam another harvest in your garden each

246
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,278
year even if you're losing a little bit

247
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,919
of weight run to run you're gaining that

248
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:16,759
weight back plus by jamming a whole

249
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:18,399
extra harvest in there I think that's

250
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,200
something we all can get down with got

251
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,679
it yeah so they're definitely pros and

252
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,640
cons and sounds like that con that you

253
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,359
mentioned is really subjective right

254
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:28,199
actually I had uh somebody on the

255
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,320
podcast pretty recently Dave Baker shout

256
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,120
out to him he was on talking about autof

257
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,560
flowers and one thing that was pretty

258
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,360
interesting is he actually uses the far

259
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:40,679
red for autof flowers cuz he wants that

260
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,919
stretch he wants that veg growth uh to

261
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,120
happen you know he wants the biggest

262
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,078
plant as you possibly get in an

263
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,039
Autoflower obviously we all know that

264
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:50,838
it's limited on its time frame for veg

265
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:53,559
it automatically flips to flower right

266
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,200
so that veg time frame is super super

267
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:57,399
important if there's any stunt growth

268
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,278
you could have a significantly smaller

269
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:02,240
plant so he utilizes fared supplements

270
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:03,639
far red in order to get a bigger stretch

271
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,600
on his autoflowers before they actually

272
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:07,039
flower I thought that was interesting

273
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,159
that is interes and this is what

274
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,399
learning looks like people go people ask

275
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:12,879
questions like how do you know that and

276
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,839
I go because someone smart told me it

277
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,838
once and I listened autof flowers that's

278
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,640
fasc because exactly like I talked about

279
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,079
like getting Bud rotten stuff that's

280
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:24,319
usually an outside uh outdoor sort of

281
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,439
thing you know but a lot of people do

282
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,440
get it indoors and I could totally see

283
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,600
you get that that giant Christmas tree

284
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,279
you can't really top an Autoflower the

285
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,000
way we would top a normal photop

286
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:36,559
periodic plant so you get this giant

287
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,839
Christmas tree Cola going up I could see

288
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,638
totally increasing that internodal

289
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,360
length gives you more room for those

290
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,360
buds to grow tells them there's more

291
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,519
space for them this makes sense to me

292
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,919
absolutely so would you say it's worth

293
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:54,240
adding in like for people actually go

294
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:55,958
out and buy the lights to supplement or

295
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,600
is it just kind of like an a plant

296
00:10:55,958 --> 00:11:00,359
additive where you can get it but it's

297
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,000
kind of like an option thing and it'll

298
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,480
take you a little bit further but it

299
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,039
might not be worth it for some so you

300
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,519
can type into Google Google image search

301
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:12,159
at some point after this podcast

302
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,000
everyone listen just type uh law of the

303
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:17,679
minimums chart or graphic the law of the

304
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,399
minimums right so if you take a barrel

305
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,638
and it's all got level sides right you

306
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,240
can fill the water up to that level of

307
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:26,360
the barrel now you take one plank of

308
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,919
that barrel and you hammer it down five

309
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,480
inch right well the height of what that

310
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:33,278
Barrel can contain is now its lowest

311
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,839
point right that's just what it is the

312
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,000
water's going to flow out that hole

313
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:39,519
until it reaches to that equilibrium

314
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,120
point of that that lowest Plank and

315
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,799
that's your new water level you pull

316
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,120
that plank up now you can fill it all

317
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:47,000
the way back up and it's it's a great

318
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,839
chart I think it's Lee Big's law of the

319
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,399
minimum I can never remember exactly the

320
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,279
the F's name I I I learned from college

321
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,559
educated people yet was not college

322
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,600
educated so I have a hard time retaining

323
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:59,319
some of the it's it's a knowledge fire

324
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,839
hose out there these days grow it's it's

325
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,240
hard to maintain all this stuff you know

326
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,839
so yeah look up law of the minimums and

327
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,919
uh I would say for

328
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,320
sure we we'll say this even about

329
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,679
something as pedantic as CO2 don't worry

330
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,920
about it until everything else is dialed

331
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,879
in if you're not hitting your DLI your

332
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:21,039
preferred ppfd you're not even going to

333
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,679
be able to uh like you're G to get

334
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,198
that's another thing about giving it

335
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:27,198
more light it's it's this weird cause

336
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:28,679
and effect Loop right don't worry about

337
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:30,599
having CO2 if you don't have enough

338
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:33,039
light and then don't worry about putting

339
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,440
more light in if you don't have CO2 it's

340
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:38,719
like a weird all all apes are monkeys or

341
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,839
all monkeys are Apes but not all apes or

342
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,079
monkeys sort of thing it like depending

343
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,160
on what you're doing is so I would say

344
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:46,759
for sure just a short answer to the

345
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:48,919
question is yeah it should be one of the

346
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:51,278
last things you're worrying about but if

347
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:52,919
you have your room dialed in and you're

348
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,519
like I don't know how I could possibly

349
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:57,198
make it any better yes now we're talking

350
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,560
you're the person that should be kind of

351
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:00,120
thinking about that but if you're a new

352
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,078
grower you're buying your first tent

353
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,240
you're like should I buy some Far red no

354
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:09,198
no your your light will contain enough

355
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,720
