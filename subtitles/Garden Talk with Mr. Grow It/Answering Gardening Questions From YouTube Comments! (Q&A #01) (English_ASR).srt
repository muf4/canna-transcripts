1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,720
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,940
know me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,798
and you're watching my extra Channel got

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,570
a new video for you today

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,160
well a new type of video I never done

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,080
this type of video before on this

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,820
channel I'm gonna answer some questions

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,820
I am going to look through my YouTube

9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,980
channel comments and a lot of these

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,109
comments I get I'm not able to respond

11
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,240
to so I figure I'd make a video and

12
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,949
respond to them here I want to do

13
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,640
different types of videos on this

14
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,320
channel the past eight or nine videos

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,450
and things have been hard test videos

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,058
and people are starting to get sick of

17
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,820
them so I am going to try to switch

18
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:41,280
things up create more content for this

19
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,530
channel YouTube likes this channel they

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,230
like part test videos they don't like

21
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,929
gardening videos they don't like the

22
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:50,488
plants that I show on the channel so I'm

23
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:52,530
trying to walk a thin line here

24
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:54,209
particularly on this channel but anyways

25
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,829
enough of that let's answer some

26
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,649
questions these questions are coming

27
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,090
from my main youtube channel if for some

28
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,259
reason you're not subscribed to my main

29
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,120
two YouTube channel you're not aware of

30
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:04,890
it I will link it down in the

31
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,590
description section below how many times

32
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,379
you top a great question it really

33
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,600
depends on growth for me personally

34
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:14,280
everybody does it different what I

35
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,589
normally do is I'll wait till the plant

36
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,060
gets up till about its fifth node then

37
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,890
only the top of the fifth node and try

38
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,259
to do LSD to spread all those lower

39
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,090
branches try to spread them all out as

40
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,500
wide as possible sometimes I want to hit

41
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,930
the fifth note on top down to the third

42
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,478
node it really depends on growth more

43
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,670
stretchier strains I'll probably top

44
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,219
down more and then do additional tops as

45
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,680
well indica strains that are real

46
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:40,739
compact I don't need to top as much I

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,070
might talk once if I top it all so it

48
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:46,319
really depends on growth for me the moon

49
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:49,739
and stars are light leaks I don't buy

50
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,269
into that tiny light leaks will affect

51
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:54,149
your plant enough to stress them out

52
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:57,359
okay so he is talking about the

53
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:59,070
equipment to status light on your

54
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,618
equipment such as humidifier or

55
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:03,328
dehumidifier air conditioner or whatever

56
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:04,950
you're running those little status

57
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:07,589
lights that are on that those LED lights

58
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,239
he's saying that he doesn't think that

59
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,000
that's gonna actually cause the plants

60
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:15,610
stress surprisingly they will

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,060
and from experience here I once left my

62
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,320
humidifier light on and my plants and

63
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,300
they were in flowering and they

64
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,560
stretched for longer than the 21-day

65
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,390
period and I'm like what tech is going

66
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,039
on here they seem to have stopped and

67
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:28,089
then they started back up again as far

68
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,709
as stretching and I was like what the

69
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,780
heck is going on here and then I

70
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:33,670
realized what happened is that I left

71
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,919
that humidifier light on so it didn't

72
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:38,019
actually affect it to the point where it

73
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,339
hurried out and was producing seeds

74
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,920
right away which I was kind of surprised

75
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:46,569
by the Moon and stars a light leak you

76
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:48,789
can do a google search and it'll talk

77
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:51,430
about plant photosynthesis and how the

78
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:54,370
moons and stars actually don't impact

79
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,230
that enough to where it's gonna you know

80
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,539
cause photosynthesis or stress the

81
00:02:56,229 --> 00:03:01,629
plants out and cause them to grow so so

82
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:03,819
yeah germinated seeds sprout first how

83
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:05,680
soon can I determine the gender of my

84
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:08,979
seedlings so there's a couple ways to do

85
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,989
it so seedling send it in to a farmer

86
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:12,488
Freeman that's my recommendation now

87
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:14,170
there's a fee for that but what they do

88
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:16,390
is they'll take a microscope and look at

89
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:18,149
the chromosomes and they'll be able to

90
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:20,798
tell if your plant is male or female

91
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:24,280
while it's still a seedling this is

92
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:26,080
something that is I want to say new but

93
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,400
it's been around for years now but a lot

94
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,989
of people don't know about it it's all

95
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,159
linked that down in the description

96
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:33,159
section below so you can learn more

97
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,479
about it but I've been doing it and it's

98
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:36,340
been a hundred percent accurate since

99
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,409
I've been using that service or you can

100
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,569
wait until the plant is late in the

101
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:43,599
vegetation stage you know weeks four

102
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:45,579
five six it may start showing signs of

103
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,889
sex he's up pistols for female and

104
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:48,519
pollen sacks for males or when you flip

105
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:52,208
to flowering

106
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:54,280
it'll then show either or I'm gonna grow

107
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:56,319
up plant indoors but it turned out to be

108
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,099
a big one and confusing that how is

109
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,180
gonna flower

110
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:02,169
I seek some help okay so in order to

111
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,549
switch it over to the flowering stage

112
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:05,559
I'm assuming you're growing a

113
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:07,930
photoperiod plant if you need to change

114
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,420
the light cycle to most people do twelve

115
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,250
hours on and then twelve hours of

116
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:14,738
complete darkness now some people will

117
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,019
do eleven hours on and thirteen hours of

118
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:19,239
complete darkness both of those will

119
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,978
transition the plant to flower stage

120
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:22,989
that's it that's how you switch it over

121
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:24,339
to flower house smell proof could this

122
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,269
material make the room he's actually

123
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:29,109
commenting on

124
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:30,250
my pop panda film poly film video if

125
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,439
installed professionally with taped

126
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,990
corners wouldn't stop smell sono poly

127
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,969
film Penta film does not stop to smell

128
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,788
at all really if you're looking to

129
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,560
control the smell look at carbon filter

130
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:43,180
and you can also look at air

131
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,030
purification systems as well something

132
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,769
like in viral cleanse would be something

133
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:49,388
look into and I'll link that in the

134
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:51,399
description section below all the

135
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,269
products I talked about in this video

136
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,758
will be linked in the description

137
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:56,348
section below and don't any discount

138
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:59,288
codes I have for those products to help

139
00:04:56,348 --> 00:05:01,329
you out but yeah either carbon filter or

140
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:04,478
air purification system that's gonna

141
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:06,490
help with smell okay so Greg is asking

142
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,899
so many to choose he's actually

143
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,240
commenting on one of my grill live

144
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:12,519
videos says so many to choose I have a

145
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,329
small tent and just need a good light

146
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:15,758
that does everything

147
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:17,468
anyone have any good recommendations so

148
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,199
Greg it really comes down to what size

149
00:05:17,468 --> 00:05:22,180
gross space you're looking to cover once

150
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,460
we know that we got to narrow down a lot

151
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,189
actually on my website mr. Greg calm

152
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:29,680
under the article section you can find

153
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:32,199
articles I've done on best LED grow

154
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,889
lights and I've done those articles last

155
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,598
year 2019 I'm working on new article for

156
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:39,848
this year for different size grow spaces

157
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:41,259
so those articles that are o 2019 a

158
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:42,750
little bit outdated but there's still

159
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:44,468
some really good grow lights in there

160
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,509
definitely check that out if you can

161
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:48,129
tell us what grow space you're looking

162
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:50,020
to cover will be able to help you out

163
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:51,430
even more if you would have said paper

164
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:53,680
towel one more time I would have laughed

165
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,468
so hard I was hoping you would keep

166
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,209
saying it much love to you girl so a lot

167
00:05:56,468 --> 00:06:03,370
of people call out my accent it's from

168
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:07,418
Boston so I say Pepa stay of paper paper

169
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:09,399
towel paper towel yeah so is the Boston

170
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:11,109
accent coming out I had a question about

171
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:13,478
farmer Freeman have you ever gotten a

172
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:16,150
result that wasn't male or female can

173
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:18,968
they detect her me or might it show as

174
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:21,038
bolt or inconclusive just curious I've

175
00:06:18,968 --> 00:06:23,800
had a couple select bagged seeds I'd

176
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,990
like to run good question we were just

177
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,360
talking about farmer Freeman I haven't

178
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,490
gotten a result that says male or female

179
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,800
I have gotten a result that said that it

180
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,120
was pending and it was gonna be another

181
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,960
day and then end up being another day

182
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,019
I don't know if they'd have probably the

183
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:40,129
sample or if they just it was the end of

184
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:42,680
the day and they couldn't get to that

185
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:44,569
particular one but now I haven't ever

186
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,939
gotten a result that wasn't male or

187
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:49,339
female how long darkness do you give

188
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:52,339
your plants after 12:12 before harvest

189
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:55,698
do you do 24 hours 48 hours heard

190
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:57,379
different reports a good question it

191
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:59,780
really all depends on my schedule my

192
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:02,860
personal schedule what I'm doing for the

193
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:05,269
day well I mean for the week actually

194
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,069
sometimes I'll do 48 hours of darkness

195
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:09,168
sometimes I do 72 hours of darkness

196
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:12,110
there's really no set rule that I have

197
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:14,469
for how long to do it the whole point of

198
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:17,500
the darkness period is supposedly

199
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:20,449
secondary metabolites it produces

200
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,579
trichomes while the lights are off so

201
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:25,310
some people will have a period of

202
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:27,709
darkness at harvest well before

203
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,889
harvesting right so they'll just put

204
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:33,918
their plant on 24 48 hours 72 hours of

205
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:36,439
darkness and then a harvest but yeah I

206
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,870
mean I do a little bit of all 24 48 72 I

207
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,069
think it's kind of marginal as far as

208
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,060
the difference there that's just my

209
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:42,649
personal opinion

210
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,300
Chris cannulas to know how those fans

211
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:46,069
hold up please I love design but the

212
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,210
reviews are bad okay so he's talking

213
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:49,430
about that oscillating fan actually

214
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:52,430
clips onto the grow tent I got that from

215
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,810
by bosun so far so good I mean I have

216
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,759
two of them running right now and

217
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,848
they've been fine running 24 hours a day

218
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,519
since I got that let's see 50 days so

219
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:03,918
far so so far so good but yeah I saw

220
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,089
saying bad reviews on Amazon if anything

221
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,129
updates on there I'll definitely

222
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:08,509
definitely update you guys hey brother

223
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:10,219

225
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,180
your seeds I live in a 420 friendly

226
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,740
state willing to pay just trying to get

227
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,360
my hands on a good strain so for those

228
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,939
of you guys who do not know I do have my

229
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,069
own strain it's called chill otogi it's

230
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:24,079
something about working on four G's

231
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:25,759
I think it's been almost two years now

232
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,589
still I kind of feel like it's in

233
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,459
development of an F to growing right now

234
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:33,408
I had some testers working on them and

235
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:36,949
they got some good results but right now

236
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:38,599
long story short is I don't have any for

237
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,479
sale at the moment but keep an eye out

238
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,789
if I do have them for sale I will

239
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,629
definitely announce some either on

240
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:48,490
Instagram probably Instagram Twitter

243
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,289

I would have seats or sale all right I'm

in the future videos like this are easy

251
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,759
for me to bust out because I'm not gonna

252
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:12,129

255
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:22,300
per video and includes filming editing

256
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,220
and then posting on to YouTube so

257
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:25,750

258
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,920
really take me a couple hours just kind

259
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:32,230
of cut up and put on to youtube so I can

260
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,419
do a lot of these videos I can do a lot

261
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:37,769
