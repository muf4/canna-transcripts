1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,160
coming up on garden talk there's kind of

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,759
this mindset that we're trying to

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,160
replicate what the roots are

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,679
actually like what's actually happening

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,599
in the soil and that's sort of

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,320
impossible because the system is so

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,839
complex

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,919
and there's so many physical and

9
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,679
chemical and biological variables that

10
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:20,079
are interplaying together that you can't

11
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:22,000
actually see what's happening and the

12
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,399
biggest issue i see here is there's this

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,839
elevated magnesium at 149 and that's

14
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,679
really going to prevent the uptake of

15
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,960
calcium and potassium i would rather

16
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,839
have that around like

17
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,600
35 parts per million if your plants are

18
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,359
uptaking those amino acids

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,760
it's saving a bunch of energy that they

20
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,479
can put toward shoot growth or flower

21
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,960
development

22
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,078
or root growth or any number of

23
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,160
metabolic

24
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,079
activities but ultimately if i had a

25
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,078
magic wand i would reduce your nitrogen

26
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,359
magnesium i might push up your soluble

27
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,119
phosphorus a little bit

28
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:58,399
and your iron and from there things

29
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:59,599
would really just fly

30
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,239
what's up everybody if you that don't

31
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,520

testing he takes a look at a soil test

41
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,519
that i got

42
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,239

43
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,438
balancing

44

control my indoor garden environment

65
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,639
so the temperature and humidity stays in

podcast i am here today with

110
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,400
bryant mason aka the soil doctor how's

111
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,878
it going today

112
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,200

today um in this episode today what

128
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,598
we're going to go over is we're going to

129
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,840
talk all about soil testing

130
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:08,639
so uh my audience is say mostly

131
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,799
beginners

132
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,359
intermediate home growers i'd like to

133
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,319
say a large majority are home growers

134
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,400
of course there are some people out

135
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,079
there that do outdoors and they are

136
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,798
commercial facilities and so on and so

137
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,280
forth but

138
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,279
i would say indoors mostly and so we'll

139
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,839
talk all about soil test today

140
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,519
um an introduction to it also i have a

141
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,119
soil test that i got from logan labs i

142
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,240
got a soil report

143
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,918
and also a saturated paste test so we'll

144
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,319
go over some of the results

145
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,319
in this podcast today and then if we

146
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,120
have time we can get into

147
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,478
some of the nutrients and what you know

148
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,560
about them particularly like

149
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,439
macronutrients maybe like the npk

150
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,199
type stuff so i'm excited for this one

151
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,120
usually when we start off the podcast

152
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,800
we talk about introductions so can you

153
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,000
give us a little introduction about you

154
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,680
tell us a little bit about yourself and

155
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,759
kind of how you got into gardening

156
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:03,038
yeah so i live in colorado and

157
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,439
i am a soil and crop advisor through the

158
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,800
american association of agronomy and so

159
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,120
what that means is i help

160
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,120
farmers in various aspects of their

161
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,240
operations but unlike other

162
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,720
crop consultants i specifically focus on

163
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,879
nutrient management in organic systems

164
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,759
so um i do help you know answer

165
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,759
questions for

166
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,319
for growers about cover cropping and

167
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,919
different farm practices but but i

168
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,159
really really focus on

169
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,799
nutrient management and i do that

170
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,360
through extensive soil testing tissue

171
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,199
testing

172
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,038
plant sap analysis so all kinds of

173
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,080
different laboratory techniques

174
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:40,399
to really hone in on the nutrient

175
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:43,120
bottlenecks that are preventing greater

176
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,359
yield or photosynthesis or quality

177
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,160
in crops on a garden level actually

178
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,680
before i was a consultant

179
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,120
i started a business in colorado called

180
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,560
the urban farm company

181
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,399
and we installed um raised bed organic

182
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,680
vegetable gardens for homeowners

183
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,679
and taught people how to grow their own

184
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,360
food in their backyard at night i

185
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,720
built that business for about five years

186
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,759
before selling it

187
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,199
but we installed probably two or three

188
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,280
thousand vegetable gardens

189
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,759
across the front range of colorado and

190
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:18,159
that enabled me to see

191
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:21,360
really um it's sort of a hyper

192
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,199
data set of gardens in different

193
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,120
environments in different backyards with

194
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,840
different crops and crop types and soil

195
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,120
types and so

196
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,879
in a sense we were able to observe um

197
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,399
very quickly what was working and what

198
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,038
wasn't and i learned a

199
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,478
tremendous amount about gardening

200
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,879
specifically in the high desert

201
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,079
in the arid west and i was i've been

202
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,600
able to translate that

203
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:46,318
into more technical and data

204
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,840
driven soil chemistry and fertility

205
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,400
recommendations so

206
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:54,719
i work with all kinds of of crops

207
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,120
i have been working more and more in

208
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,120
soilless media and potting soils

209
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,639
in indoor environments but i also work

210
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,439
with a

211
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,038
small organic veggie producers uh tree

212
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,918
fruit and i'm actually

213
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:09,839
currently starting a peach orchard in

214
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:10,959
western colorado so i have a

215
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,560
my hands in a lot of different

216
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,680
agricultural enterprises and i get to

217
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,959
see things from a lot of different

218
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,560
angles so

219
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,799
that's that's just in a nutshell kind of

220
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,199
my background awesome

221
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,919
now let's get into talking about soil

222
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,800
testing

223
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,038
and the soil audits that you do first

224
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,360
off

225
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,719
what is soil testing and why should

226
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,759
growers get them

227
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,639
yeah so a soil test is essentially uh

228
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,199
when you take

229
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,079
a sample an aggregate sample from your

230
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,560
garden so

231
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,519
you choose multiple locations around

232
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,280
your garden

233
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,719
and you mix it all together into an

234
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,159
aggregate sample and you send it to a

235
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,240
laboratory and there's there's

236
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,479
university laboratories there's third

237
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,680
party private labs and the labs

238
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,519
use different data or i'm sorry

239
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,918
extraction techniques

240
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,198
and they extract the nutrients from the

241
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,439
soil and give you a

242
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,960
chemical nutrient analysis of what is in

243
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,319
your soil because

244
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,918
all soils are different you can actually

245
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,199
see this map behind me there's a map of

246
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,439
the united states that shows

247
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,199
all the different soil orders and you

248
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,360
can just see there's just tremendous

249
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,000
variability and diversity in soil

250
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,680
so it's really important to to test your

251
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,399
soil to understand what you're starting

252
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,759
with

253
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,878
some soils have really really high

254
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,960
magnesium some have really low magnesium

255
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,319
and you can go nutrient by nutrient and

256
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:28,159
and there's infinite iterations so um

257
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,919
the reason a soil test is important is

258
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,639
because there are

259
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:34,559
you know somewhat of gardening

260
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,120
prescriptions that exist on the internet

261
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,918
like

262
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,639
feed your tomatoes epsom salt but that

263
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,639
only works in one specific soil type or

264
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,399
one specific context sometimes

265
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,919
there's enough magnesium and you don't

266
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,120
need epsom salt so

267
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,958
the best way to to apply nutrients is to

268
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,480
first figure out what's actually in your

269
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,518
soil and that's the purpose of a soil

270
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,120
test

271
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,120
and to go a little deeper what the lab

272
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,600
does is there's a number of different

273
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,039
kinds of soil tests there's and and

274
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,560
usually they're

275
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,559
specific to different parts of the

276
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,518
country so they use

277
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,079
different acids and they mix the soil

278
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,879
with an

279
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,680
acidic solution that extracts the

280
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,399
nutrients

281
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,079
so um you know i like a soil test called

282
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,039
a maleic 3 and they use a

283
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,320
an acid with a ph of 2.5 to extract all

284
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,759
the nutrients

285
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,160
and i also like what's called the

286
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,879
saturated paste test which just uses

287
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,559
water

288
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,080
to extract the nutrients so i can go

289
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,759
into that more if you'd like but

290
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,360
the point is there's a lot of different

291
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:35,600
kinds of soil tests

292
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,680
and um there's a lot of nuance

293
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,920
so what's important is to choose a lab

294
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,759
and choose a specific soil test and not

295
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,439
change because all labs and all

296
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,120
protocols and soil tests are different

297
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,959
so it's important to stick with one over

298
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,759
time and really calibrate

299
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,000
to one specific kind of test gotcha i

300
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,480
know

301
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,399
one of the most popular testing

302
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,680
facilities is logan labs

303
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,440
and that's the one i went through from

304
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,759
my soil report

305
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,920
that i have in the saturated pace test

306
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,319
now you can either go through a lab or

307
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,278
like on amazon you can buy the home test

308
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,600
kits

309
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:10,000
so are they worth it i've seen some

310
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,079
video where this guy did a test on the

311
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,278
home test kits and he compared it to it

312
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,519
i think he had a couple different home

313
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,039
test kits and one was like extremely

314
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,278
inaccurate and one of them was like

315
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,039
pretty pretty on point to what he saw

316
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,278
got from back from the lab so

317
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,399
you know in your opinion are home soil

318
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:26,480
tests worth it or

319
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,480
is it really kind of a waste of money

320
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,159
you know i

321
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,600
i fall in the ladder camp where i think

322
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,120
it's a waste of money now

323
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,120
let me let me explain why there's

324
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,839
essentially two reasons

325
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,078
the first is that they're not very

326
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,360
accurate compared to what a commercial

327
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:44,838
laboratory would use

328
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,399
they use um equipment like uh

329
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,560
um an inductively coupled plasma mass

330
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,320
spectrometer it's a big name for a

331
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,759
piece of equipment that costs about two

332
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,160
hundred thousand dollars

333
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,399
and is extremely accurate in identifying

334
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,199
each and every macro micronutrient down

335
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,240
to

336
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,000
the part per million so the garden kits

337
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,799
are not accurate usually it's a it's a

338
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
color metric

339
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,240
type of thing where you're matching the

340
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,799
color um to

341
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,720
a certain chart that tells you the level

342
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,759
now that's not my biggest issue with it

343
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,240
actually because precision you know

344
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,159
super super accurate data isn't

345
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,759
necessarily the goal the goal

346
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,439
of a soil test is just to give you

347
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,200
direction in terms of what you should be

348
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,399
applying and what you shouldn't so

349
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,000
the accuracy thing while it is

350
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,600
surely a problem isn't the reason i

351
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,240
think these tests are a waste of money

352
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,360
the real reason is that

353
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,079
if you use one of these kits usually

354
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,759
there's not

355
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:45,359
a good um standard

356
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:47,200
or target level that you'd be familiar

357
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,240
with using these kits it may say hi

358
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,360
low or medium but the reality is

359
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,440
you really need to see data

360
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,200
over and over again like i've probably

361
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,399
seen five or ten thousand tests from

362
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,519
logan labs so i've

363
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:05,039
i'm hyper calibrated to

364
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,360
logan labs uh test reports if i were to

365
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,519
change labs whether it's a home test kit

366
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,560
or another commercial lab the data would

367
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,120
would essentially be

368
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,518
unhelpful and so the biggest issue for

369
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,320
me around these home test kits is that

370
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,959
they they don't really give you a good

371
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,120
quality

372
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:26,319
baseline i don't think high low and

373
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,320
medium is actually

374
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,559
a very good approach to managing soil

375
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,879
and so

376
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,559
it's better to either have a consultant

377
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,439
or an agronomist even if it's with the

378
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,759
commercial lab

379
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,839
doing the interpretation because there's

380
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,240
a lot of nuance in interpreting a soil

381
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,839
test

382
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,320
so that's sort of my my two cents on

383
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,639
that i've also mentioned that i've used

384
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,760
home test kits where i've taken the same

385
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,000
soil

386
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,600
and i've tested it twice and the results

387
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,240
were different between

388
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,399
the two the two tests so that that

389
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,360
didn't really give me much confidence

390
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,200
wow yeah and like you said there's a

391
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,278
difference between getting a soil test

392
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,560
and seeing the results and then knowing

393
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,720
what actions to take

394
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,078
after the fact right or getting

395
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,399
consulting

396
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,199
and that's where soil audit comes into

397
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,440
place can you

398
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,720
tell us about soil audit yeah sure and

399
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
let me add one thing to the last

400
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,639
question a p

401
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,639
a ph a home ph uh test

402
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,240
i think is pretty good um if you're

403
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,519
trying to figure out if your ph is

404
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,278
five or eight i think it's it's totally

405
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,039
worth it to do a simple

406
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,958
ph test with litmus paper whatever

407
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,000
whatever the the test is those tend to

408
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,159
be accurate enough to

409
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,078
actually get a sense of if you should be

410
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,799
increasing your ph or not

411
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:43,679
um i also just want to add that when it

412
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,359
comes to soil testing

413
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,278
there's there's kind of this this

414
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,000
mindset that we're trying to replicate

415
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,559
what the roots

416
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,600
are actually like what's actually

417
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,039
happening

418
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,959
in the soil and that's sort of

419
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,919
impossible because the system is so

420
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,078
complex

421
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,399
and there's so many uh physical and

422
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:02,159
chemical and biological variables that

423
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,360
are interplaying together that you can't

424
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:07,439
actually see what's happening but these

425
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,320
soil tests are just a proxy to give us

426
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,160
sort of a

427
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,399
a sense of of what's happening so

428
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,078
anyway that the the purpose of me saying

429
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,078
that is there isn't

430
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:20,399
i'm not here to promote one specific

431
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,599
soil test i think what's key is to get

432
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,600
comfortable with one

433
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,680
as a proxy and be able to relate that to

434
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,720
plant health and stick with that so

435
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:31,278
to get into the soil audit what i do

436
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,480
i probably do 20 to 30 of these a day

437
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:35,679
it's my primary

438
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,159
role as a consultant is growers send

439
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:40,159
their soil to logan labs and they get

440
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,600
two separate soil tests on the same soil

441
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:43,198
one is the maelic three which i already

442
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,320
talked about it's called a standard test

443
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,599
and the other

444
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,079
is a saturated paste test and so

445
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,519
the maelic 3 is a strong acid extraction

446
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,120
it looks at what's theoretically

447
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,120
available in the soil so all the

448
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,600
nutrients kind of like the bank account

449
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,120
of nutrients and the paste test is on

450
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,000
the other end of the spectrum and it's

451
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,480
showing what's

452
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,078
immediately available today so not all

453
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,720
the theoretically available nutrients

454
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,719
just what's soluble in the soil solution

455
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,278
and the soil solution is a term for the

456
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,040
water in the pore space of the soil

457
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:17,039
uh that plants roots have access to

458
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,719
right now that's it's the water that's

459
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,039
actually uptaken by the roots

460
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,160
so the paste test is a really really

461
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,159
good test to see

462
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,159
what's what the plant roots are actually

463
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,000
swimming in and so i look at both of

464
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:32,000
these tests from logan labs

465
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,799
and i do a whole bunch of agronomic math

466
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,559
and write recommendations for growers on

467
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,799
how to amend their soil

468
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,559
so it may be and most of the time this

469
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,120
is a pre-plant recommendation so before

470
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:45,359
the season or before they

471
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,720
put in their new round of indoor plants

472
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,399
uh they

473
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,079
send me the soil test and i write a

474
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,839
recommendation of how many

475
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:53,519
pounds per cubic yard of soil they

476
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,480
should apply of let's say

477
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,639
alfalfa meal or gypsum or a

478
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,278
micronutrient like manganese sulfate and

479
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,799
i go

480
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,759
nutrient by nutrient and i write

481
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,838
customized recommendations and the goal

482
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,680
that i the approach that i take is the

483
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,199
first thing i'm trying to do is achieve

484
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,958
sufficiency so i'm trying to make sure

485
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:12,879
there's enough of every nutrient in the

486
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,399
soil for the plants to be healthy

487
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:18,639
and this varies by species so

488
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,679
you know a recommendation for lettuce is

489
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,000
going to look different than

490
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,519
for tomatoes in the same soil and then

491
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,278
this and then the second thing i'm

492
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,959
aiming for is balance so it's very

493
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,559
important to have balance

494
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,239
between the different nutrients in the

495
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,638
soil so um

496
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,919
you know there needs to be enough

497
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,519
calcium and there needs to be enough

498
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,360
magnesium but there also needs to be a

499
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,560
good balance between those two nutrients

500
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,399
to optimize

501
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,159
the nutrient uptake by the plant and so

502
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,720
the recommendations or the audit that i

503
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,120
do

504
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,480
is giving people more information about

505
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,159
what their soil

506
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,240
looks like and the chemistry of their

507
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:51,919
soil but there's also a very actionable

508
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,839
recommendation of how to

509
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,360
amend their soil to move it closer to

510
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,920
sufficiency and balance and that's

511
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,519
really

512
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:01,679
a soil audit they're 40 dollars per test

513
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,600
and usually i can turn them around

514
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,959
within 24 hours of receiving the soil

515
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,480
test results

516
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,078
and then growers can actually take it

517
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,038
and implement it immediately and the

518
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,318
beauty of

519
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:14,480
of the my business is i get to see over

520
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:14,959
time how the nutrient levels in the soil

521
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,160
change

522
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,199
and so i've really calibrated very very

523
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,400
accurately

524
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,000
to hit specific ppms in the soil using

525
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,919
organic amendments

526
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,519
and i've optimized it for a number of

527
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,559
different crops so i have a model at

528
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,879
this point that gets

529
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,000
pretty pretty close in pre-plant

530
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,360
amendments

531
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,279
okay and just to touch back on the

532
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,359
pricing you had mentioned forty dollars

533
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:38,558
for is that just for the audit or does

534
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,038
that also include the

535
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,960
testing through logan labs it's just the

536
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,960
audit so the forty dollars goes to me

537
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,079
and that's for the recommendation okay

538
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,558
the foil test through logan labs cost 55

539
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,678
for both the standard and the saturated

540
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,319
paste test

541
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,679
and um that can the growers can either

542
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,599
purchase that directly through logan

543
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,240
labs or they can go through my website

544
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,918
and purchase it as a package

545
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,519
with the soil test and the right and the

546
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,840
audit so

547
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:07,679
it doesn't really matter to me um but

548
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,439
that's kind of how the pricing works

549
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,038
i feel like for home growers you know if

550
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,160
you're reusing your soil and over and

551
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:13,919
over again maybe

552
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,279
what do you think like once a year maybe

553
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,360
get their soil tested

554
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,879
or in between grows or what is the

555
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,959
general recommendation for that

556
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,480
yeah it really depends on the economic

557
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,880
value of the crop

558
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,640
so commercial growers i work with who

559
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,039
are growing really high value

560
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,038
medicinal plants are testing every two

561
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:34,558
weeks because

562
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:36,798
any increase in yield pays for itself

563
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,639
a hundred fold because the tests you

564
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:40,400
know 100 bucks every two weeks for

565
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,240
nutrient management is nothing compared

566
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,000
to the yield that they're getting

567
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,759
if you're a home gardener and

568
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,759
it depends on how serious you are if

569
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,319
you're an enthusiast

570
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,440
if you're kind of a hobbyist once a year

571
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,079
is the minimum

572
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,720
i would say every time you plant every

573
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:58,480
time you're

574
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,000
you're replanting you should you should

575
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,679
test so in my garden

576
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,079
in my vegetable garden i test

577
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,080
once a year i put down the amendments

578
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:10,879
and i let things rip

579
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,599
when i'm really trying to optimize

580
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,840
specific

581
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,519
plants my medicinal garden plants i'm

582
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:17,439
testing usually

583
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,359
once before planting and then once in

584
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,440
veg immediately before flower

585
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,359
to really give myself the opportunity to

586
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,720
top dress or just see where things are

587
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:29,199
to adjust my feed uh my liquid feeds

588
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,319
so that's kind of the minimum amount the

589
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,558
other thing i'd mention

590
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,639
is i recommend that if you're going to

591
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:36,558
test mid-season you also do a tissue

592
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,559
test and the tissue test

593
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:40,639
is where you take you know leaves off of

594
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,720
your plants um you send it in again

595
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,200
logan lab says tissue test for 40

596
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,640
a pop and you can actually see the

597
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,038
nutrient concentration

598
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,960
in the the plant because what i like to

599
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,480
say is the plant doesn't lie

600
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,240
so just because you can have you can

601
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,759
have a perfectly you know sufficient and

602
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,599
balanced soil but at the end of the day

603
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:01,038
the plant is going to decide

604
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:03,119
um what it uptakes and so

605
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,319
to have a soil test alongside a tissue

606
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,359
test is really

607
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,158
the best thing to do so for a home

608
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:10,798
grower

609
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,400
i think what i would recommend if you're

610
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,440
really an enthusiast is to do

611
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,798
one soil test before planting and then

612
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,960
one soil test

613
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,000
right around that time when the plant is

614
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,840
transitioning from

615
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,558
a vegetative state to a reproductive

616
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:28,319
state with a tissue test

617
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:31,038
gotcha okay cool now let's get into

618
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,639
the soil test that i got so i sent it

619
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,720
over to you prior to

620
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,880
filming today there is just the the

621
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,400
regular test and then also the saturated

622
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,600
pace test so we won't go over every

623
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,600
single line item

624
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,359
there but maybe just take a look at it

625
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,279
and kind of what stands out to you

626
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,678
and kind of general recommendations so

627
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,558
on and so forth yeah yeah so let me walk

628
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,320
through how i would

629
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:51,918
how i would look at a test okay so the

630
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:53,918
first thing i'm looking at is the

631
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,640
standard soil test which is in blue and

632
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,640
gray

633
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,720
um when you when it's received from

634
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,679
logan labs the saturated paste test is

635
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,558
kind of in a

636
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,080
pink orange color so first thing i look

637
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:06,079
at on the standard test is about the

638
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,199
sixth line down it says organic matter

639
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:09,918
percent

640
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,038
and that gives me an indication of if

641
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,880
it's topsoil

642
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:17,759
so you know real soil that has sand

643
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,919
silt and clay or if it's soilless media

644
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,679
or potting mix that's primarily composed

645
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,799
of peat moss coco coir

646
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,240
aggregate and compost so the first thing

647
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:27,200
i see here is that the organic matter is

648
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,880
57

649
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,960
so that indicates to me that it's a

650
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,080
soilless media so it's more of a

651
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,960
of a engineered media and this is

652
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,678
typically used

653
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,558
for high value crops in indoors or in in

654
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,600
raised beds

655
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:43,200
or in pots you really only want to use

656
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:44,319
soilless media in pots you don't want to

657
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,000
use

658
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:50,079
topsoil so i i first determine if it's

659
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,119
topsoil or soilless media and that that

660
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:56,000
totally changes how i analyze things

661
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:58,399
it completely changes the analysis so

662
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,599
i'll walk through how i do soilless

663
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,120
media

664
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:07,199
next thing i look at is the ph ph of 6.6

665
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:09,439
um i think anywhere from like 6.0 to 7.2

666
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,600
is a great range for soilless media

667
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,200
plants tend to do just fine in the high

668
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,439
fives but

669
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,640
you start to see issues with calcium

670
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,440
uptake below 6

671
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,720
and micronutrient issues that really

672
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,080
appear visually

673
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:27,440
below about 5.5 but it kind of depends

674
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:28,639
so 6.6 is perfect i i think six four to

675
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,159
six six is really

676
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,640
optimal um actually i'd say six four to

677
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,760
like

678
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,159
six eight and okay so the next thing i

679
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:40,319
look at i skip sulfur and i look to the

680
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,840
it says maelic 3 phosphorus and it's

681
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:45,200
reported in in

682
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,079
pounds per acre of p205 i like that

683
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,519
around about

684
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:53,038
1500 but it really depends too on

685
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:55,119
how well that phosphorus is is becoming

686
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,960
available in the soil solution so i pop

687
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:59,279
over to the paste test

688
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,279
and so i'm going to be jumping between

689
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:04,319
the paste tests and the standard test

690
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:06,798
and i see that the phosphorus

691
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,960
on the saturated paste report is 2.88

692
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:10,720
ppm so i think that's a great level so i

693
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,600
don't think you necessarily need to

694
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,640
have more phosphorous i might apply

695
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,719
maybe five

696
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,559
cups of bone meal or soft rock phosphate

697
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,360
just to keep moving that phosphorus

698
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:21,759
number up

699
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:23,759
but ultimately biology is going to cycle

700
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,440
that phosphorus into availability and

701
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,440
create good availability

702
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,360
right around 3 ppm so i'm happy with

703
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,600
that so

704
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:33,119
i keep working down i skip on the

705
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,359
standard test i skip

706
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,479
the exchangeable cations calcium mag and

707
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:38,399
potassium

708
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,839
i would not skip those on a topsoil but

709
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,320
for soilless media

710
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,000
i much prefer to look at the saturated

711
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:47,359
paste report

712
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,679
and the reason for that is because

713
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,798
soilless media doesn't actually have any

714
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,360
clay in it

715
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:54,079
and clay is what when you're looking at

716
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,119
um

717
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,960
the cation balance in the

718
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,558
these the malik 3 is developed for

719
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,919
topsoil where clay

720
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:05,440
is holding different cations within its

721
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,759
clay has a

722
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,480
slight negative charge and so it holds

723
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,240
these positively charged cations

724
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,839
but because loyalist media doesn't have

725
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,359
that i'd rather just see what's

726
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:18,720
immediately available

727
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,079
um in the soil solution so i pop over to

728
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,720
the paste test

729
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,960
and i look at calcium mag potassium and

730
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,000
sodium calcium's at 170 parts per

731
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,600
million

732
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,038
that's very sufficient pretty good level

733
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:35,119
magnesium is 149 potassium is 230 parts

734
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:38,319
per million and sodium is 33.

735
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:39,839
okay so when i look at that great

736
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,839
calcium levels

737
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:42,879
great pretty pretty high potassium

738
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:44,639
levels

739
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,320
really low sodium which is great because

740
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,600
sodium is not actually a plant nutrient

741
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,079
so you want to minimize

742
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,439
you want to absolutely minimize sodium

743
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:53,439
in your soil because it's going to

744
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,798
compete so all of those four cations are

745
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,159
going to compete with one another for

746
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,639
plant uptake

747
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,159
so all of those are sufficient the next

748
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,400
thing i mentioned is balance and it's

749
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,080
really important that these are balanced

750
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,559
and the biggest issue i see here is

751
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,918
there's this elevated magnesium at 149

752
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:10,319
and that's really going to prevent the

753
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:14,000
uptake of calcium and potassium

754
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:16,558
i would rather have that around like 35

755
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,919
parts per million so that's it's it's

756
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,200
much higher than i would want it and

757
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,600
that's reflected in that

758
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,200
percent magnesium on the on the paste

759
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:26,319
report

760
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:30,720
a little bit lower in white

761
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:33,119
it's magnesium is 44

762
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,240
of the cations on the paste report i'd

763
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:39,439
rather have it at about 15 to 20 percent

764
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,400
so one thing one little trick is i

765
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,480
actually like to have

766
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,600
epsom salt which is magnesium sulfate on

767
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,599
hand i like to run magnesium levels low

768
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:49,918
and then if i need if a certain cultivar

769
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,240
needs more magnesium i like to apply

770
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,320
a foliar spray of epsom salt to just

771
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,240
kind of help it along and that really

772
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,240
maximizes the calcium and potassium

773
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,759
uptake

774
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,319
so anyway there's a whole there's a

775
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:04,079
whole game there's kind of an art

776
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:05,678
game with balance when it comes to

777
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,278
cations and one of my biggest issues

778
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,440
with calmag is there's too much

779
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,359
magnesium and so you start to see these

780
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,480
elevated magnesium levels which can come

781
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,678
from calmag

782
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,440
dolomitic lime compost a lot of compost

783
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,480
or high in magnesium and so

784
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,080
a major issue this is very common is

785
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,919
high magnesium now this isn't going to

786
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:25,278
create toxicity you probably won't even

787
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,880
see it in your plants

788
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,640
you can still have really really healthy

789
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,720
plants but

790
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,520
if you if you're really trying to

791
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,400
maximize and optimize yield and quality

792
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,000
you want to get that magnesium down i'll

793
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,080
take a breather for a second and take a

794
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,558
sip of tea do you have any questions

795
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,079
at this point uh i think just basic

796
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:44,480
question would be like you had mentioned

797
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:47,278
uh

798
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,679
foliar spray for magnesium what would be

799
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:49,599
like

800
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,320
the kind of the ratio the recipe for

801
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:55,278
that uh i say a tablespoon per gallon

802
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,839
of epsom salt uh tables a per gallon of

803
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:57,839
water

804
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:59,839
you could do it's like one to three

805
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,359
teaspoons so

806
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:02,720
and and i think it's forgiving i've

807
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:03,678
never applied it more than that but i'm

808
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,720
sure you could do

809
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,960
two tablespoons with no issue but i'm

810
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,240
all about frequency over intensity so i

811
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,200
would much rather

812
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,880
apply three foliar sprays maybe four

813
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,080
days apart

814
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,840
then then do one massive application

815
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:20,558
because the reality is the the phylo

816
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:23,678
plane the leaf

817
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:26,480
can't uptake that that much and one

818
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,120
in one fell swoop so frequency is always

819
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,798
better

820
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,319
and then there's some folks that say you

821
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:31,519
need to you should be spraying at a

822
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:33,678
certain time

823
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,440
is there a recommendation for for you on

824
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,480
when the spray should happen

825
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,440
yeah absolutely so

826
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,558
there are stomata which are specialized

827
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,880
guard cells

828
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:48,639
in a leaf and they open and close uh

829
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,640
and they're critical for photosynthesis

830
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,038
because they're exchanging gases

831
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,840
co2 and oxygen in and out of the leaf

832
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,359
and

833
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,879
turns out that stomata can actually

834
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:58,240
uptake nutrients as well so

835
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,880
the best time to spray is when the

836
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,399
stomata are open and that will maximize

837
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,440
the nutrient uptake in the leaf

838
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:08,398
most stomata in uh in

839
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,080
dicots which are the majority of the

840
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:11,519
plants we're growing our dicots are on

841
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,000
the underside of the leaf

842
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,720
so when you apply your foliar you kind

843
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,558
of want to aim

844
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:21,200
up if possible and

845
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,639
you want to apply it when the stomata

846
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,319
are open which tends to be

847
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,559
early in the morning or later at night

848
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,319
really it's a function of vapor pressure

849
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,798
deficit or vpd

850
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:34,558
so height you know when it's when it's

851
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:37,918
humid and kind of cool

852
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:40,158
that's when you want to be applying um

853
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,278
because in in the middle of the day when

854
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,240
the vpd's high

855
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:46,480
the the stomata close because they're

856
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,480
trying to preserve

857
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,599
water they don't want to lose too much

858
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,720
water

859
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:54,000
in hot dry environments so that's

860
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,360
that's definitely what i'd recommend

861
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,558
most growers do it first thing in the

862
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,839
morning

863
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:01,839
or you know real late at night okay cool

864
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,519
uh i also if you're indoors i turn my

865
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:04,798
lights down when i do foliar

866
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:06,079
applications

867
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,558
yeah i know there were some concerns

868
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,240
from people that uh the the

869
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:12,079
the light will come down and kind of act

870
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,359
as a magnifying lens

871
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:16,480
on those droplets um and that could burn

872
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:18,158
your plants or

873
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,159
or whatever yeah it depends on the

874
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,240
product

875
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,559
but in epsom salt probably not but a lot

876
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,880
of the ipm products for sure

877
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:28,798
if you're using synthetic like a calcium

878
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,360
chloride that could really

879
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,200
you know burn um it just depends on the

880
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:33,678
style of grow and the product being used

881
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,278
and

882
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,640
the rate okay gotcha okay let me keep

883
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:40,880
let me keep walking through this test i

884
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,440
never finished um

885
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,480
okay so that covers the phosphorus and

886
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,240
the cations

887
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,919
and the ph the next thing i look at

888
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,200
on this saturated paste report is the

889
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:56,320
soluble salts so soluble salts

890
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,278
is essentially the same as ec it's just

891
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,398
electrical conductivity um what you'd

892
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,679
usually see

893
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:05,439
as an ec of one you multiply that by

894
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,919
640. so

895
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,759
the the soluble salts are just an

896
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,120
aggregate measurement of all the the

897
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:14,000
total nutrient load

898
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:15,839
in the soil solution and this one is

899
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,240
1800 ppm

900
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,119
that's a pretty high level uh most

901
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,960
plants maybe

902
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,479
beans and more sensitive veggies

903
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,000
wouldn't like those levels but heavy

904
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,919
feeders

905
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,038
you know your medicinal garden plants

906
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,799
tomatoes

907
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:30,240
even peppers can really handle those

908
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,079
high levels and will thrive at those

909
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,200
nutrient levels but i wouldn't

910
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:38,079
want to push my nutrients much higher

911
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,080
um i think the sweet spot is actually um

912
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:41,439
for for indoor cultivation right around

913
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:44,079
like

914
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,640
900 to 1200 so right around a thousand i

915
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,319
think is

916
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,759
is all you need so um this just gives a

917
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:53,599
sense of how heavily

918
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:55,759
this soil should be fed or amended

919
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:57,278
and in this case there's total

920
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:58,640
sufficiency at these levels and we're

921
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:02,000
really just going for balance

922
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,640
so reducing the magnesium

923
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,079
maybe reducing the sulfur so let's jump

924
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,480
down to chloride

925
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:10,720
i like chloride less than 120. your

926
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,640
chloride's at 83. so no problem there

927
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,960
bicarbonates are 43.

928
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,000
bicarbonates really aren't an issue

929
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,880
below 100 or

930
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,200
120 so there's no issue there

931
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,399
bicarbonates can can tie up

932
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,440
nutrients because it's a it's an anion

933
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:28,879
so it can it can

934
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,759
tie up iron and magnesium um in alkaline

935
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,880
environments

936
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:34,558
so then i go to sulfur on the paste test

937
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,440
which is a much better and more accurate

938
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:38,398
measurement than this

939
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,320
the standard test and it looks like your

940
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,158
sulfur is 75 parts per million i think

941
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:43,278
that's great i think 40 is the minimum

942
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,559
for medicinal plants

943
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:49,038
20 for veggies so that's great

944
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:49,918
and sulfur just comes in naturally

945
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:52,558
through most

946
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,200
amendments that are bringing in cations

947
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:56,558
so

948
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,038
gypsum for example is calcium sulfate

949
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:00,480
uh potassium sulfate or magnesium

950
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:01,119
sulfate all these are just naturally

951
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,440
bringing in

952
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,479
sulfur and so you usually have elevated

953
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,759
sulfur just from

954
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:11,440
the application of gypsum or

955
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:13,359
some a product like that okay so

956
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,120
next i jump down to the micronutrients

957
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:16,319
we're looking at boron iron manganese

958
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:17,918
copper and zinc so i

959
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:20,319
copper and zinc i always look at on the

960
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,880
standard test so on the standard test

961
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:22,879
you have

962
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,319
0.96 so less than one ppm of copper and

963
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,918
1.7 ppm of zinc

964
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,439
totally depends on the crop but i would

965
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,440
want to move both of those levels

966
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,960
up with a little bit of copper sulfate

967
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,038
and zinc sulfate by the way all the

968
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,759
amendments that i recommend are organic

969
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:41,599
so if a soil test validates that you

970
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:43,599
need micronutrients you you

971
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:46,879
can use trace mineral or micro

972
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:48,798
micronutrient sulfates

973
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,640
looking at boron iron and manganese on

974
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:54,798
the paste report

975
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:56,559
boron at 0.24 is great iron at 0.17

976
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,480
should probably go up and manganese at

977
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,960
0.28 is great so you always want iron to

978
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,278
be higher than manganese

979
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,278
so i'd want iron maybe a 0.75 and

980
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:06,798
manganese maybe at 0.4 or something like

981
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:08,159
that so your manganese is actually

982
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:09,599
pretty good and the biggest priority

983
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,399
here is iron there's two ways to get

984
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,158
iron you can use

985
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:13,839
iron sulfate or you can use a product

986
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,120
like blood meal that's naturally high in

987
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:17,439
iron

988
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,319
to fulfill your nitrogen requirement and

989
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,120
get iron

990
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:22,879
as a secondary nutrient so let's jump

991
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,000
over to nitrogen because nitrogen is the

992
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,600
final thing that i would look

993
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,880
at and that's on the standard test at

994
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:32,158
the very bottom

995
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,919
um in the other category there's

996
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,600
ammonium and nitrate

997
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,360
those are two different forms of

998
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:40,558
nitrogen they're two different

999
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:41,918
um they're like two different molecular

1000
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:43,119
forms of nitrogen

1001
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,320
nitrogen is a really interesting

1002
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:46,158
nutrient because there's actually

1003
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:47,759
multiple forms of nitrogen that the

1004
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,679
plant can uptake and they're

1005
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,440
they act very differently in the plant

1006
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,440
and in the soil for that matter

1007
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,519
so ammonium is nh4 plus it's a cation

1008
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,519
and nitrate is no3 minus which is an

1009
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,720
anion so it has a negative charge

1010
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:05,120
and in most soils

1011
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,000
what happens is an organic amendment

1012
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:07,518
will go into the soil

1013
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,358
so let's just say soybean meal is

1014
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,199
applied to the soil and the microbes

1015
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:13,679
feed first so the microbes

1016
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,719
break it down mineralize it into

1017
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,240
ammonium

1018
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,838
and then very quickly another set of

1019
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,439
microbes takes it from ammonium and

1020
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:21,358
converts it into nitrate

1021
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,200
so what happens is over the course of

1022
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,398
maybe two weeks in a warm moist

1023
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,960
environment

1024
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:28,638
you'll see almost all of your nitro

1025
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,480
nitrogen in the nitrate form

1026
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,519
so sure enough there's only one ppm of

1027
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,679
ammonium and 420 of of nitrate

1028
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,679
so that means that your amendments have

1029
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,878
fully mineralized or broken down which

1030
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,440
is a good thing

1031
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:44,239
and nitrate is definitely the preferred

1032
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,559
form of nitrogen for most crops

1033
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,358
unless you're growing rice or something

1034
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:51,759
you really want

1035
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:54,159
nitrate not ammonium so um

1036
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,440
i think it and and nitrogen management

1037
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,920
is totally

1038
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,079
context dependent what i mean by that is

1039
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,320
if you're growing in pots

1040
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,119
it depends on the volume of soil if

1041
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,200
you're growing

1042
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:10,559
in um topsoil

1043
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:13,598
it's it it changes everything

1044
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,679
because in topsoil you're also

1045
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,960
i also look at how much nitrogen is

1046
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:18,719
going to be contribute

1047
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,639
contributed by the organic matter

1048
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,959
breaking down so the nitrogen

1049
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:26,000
calculation may be a little bit too

1050
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,960
uh detailed for this podcast

1051
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,679
but what i'd say is you'd want i i think

1052
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,599
nitrate

1053
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:33,679
is is good at about 100 parts per

1054
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,079
million for heavy feeding

1055
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,919
crops so you're a bit high and i would

1056
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,480
say the combination of your magnesium

1057
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,320
and your

1058
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,079
and your elevated nitrate is what's

1059
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,599
leading to that slightly elevated

1060
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,160
soluble salts level

1061
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,838
so if you could um the good thing is

1062
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:50,159
that in soilless media

1063
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:52,159
after harvest you could you could leech

1064
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:53,759
your soil you could just run like

1065
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:55,759
you know water through your soil until

1066
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,440
about six to 12 inches of water

1067
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,800
leeches out the bottom of your pots or

1068
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,720
your beds or whatever

1069
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,240
and that would bring the nitrate down

1070
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:04,159
and the magnesium down

1071
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:05,519
dramatically probably cutting it

1072
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:08,879
anywhere from like 50 to

1073
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:11,280
80 percent so the

1074
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,559
different cultivars of heavy feeding

1075
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,839
medicinal plants

1076
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:17,119
will perform way differently at these

1077
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:19,519
nitrogen levels

1078
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,880
but for most cultivars in my experience

1079
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:23,358
you'll get

1080
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,480
your internode spacing will be too too

1081
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:26,559
wide and the

1082
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,719
and the flower buds will be a little bit

1083
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,719
too kind of loose and fluffy

1084
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,759
when the nitrogen is elevated you can

1085
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:34,799
also screw up

1086
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,560
um the profile of secondary metabolites

1087
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,720
so like you know terpenes and different

1088
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:41,358
aromatic substances can really

1089
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:43,358
be decreased at those nitrogen levels

1090
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:45,358
with sensitive plants like

1091
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:47,519
um i'm trying to think there are certain

1092
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,440
veggies that would actually

1093
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,838
be burned at those levels you'd start to

1094
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,920
see like the traditional burn symptoms

1095
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:54,719
of necrosis on the on the outer leaf

1096
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,079
edges

1097
00:36:54,719 --> 00:37:02,239
um for you know legumes

1098
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:05,119
for sure and and other sensitive plants

1099
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,879
any questions on that no so that that's

1100
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,240
pretty much it huh so overall it's

1101
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,680
pretty decent um

1102
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:11,759
there's a couple areas that can be

1103
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:12,559
improved upon but yeah that's that's

1104
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,280
pretty much uh

1105
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:16,239
pretty much it for the audit yeah yeah

1106
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,599
so the the

1107
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:22,719
analysis is you know there's a lot to it

1108
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,480
um it totally depends on if it's topsoil

1109
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:26,239
or soilless media the nitrogen

1110
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,519
concentration totally depends on the

1111
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:30,639
soil volume

1112
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:32,559
the cultivar the species etc

1113
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:34,799
but ultimately if i had a magic wand i

1114
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:36,000
would reduce your nitrogen magnesium i

1115
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,240
might push up your soluble

1116
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,159
phosphorus a little bit and your iron

1117
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,679
and um

1118
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:43,279
and from there things would really just

1119
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,358
fly cool now

1120
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,280
there was one talking a little bit

1121
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:49,119
deeper about nitrogen there was one

1122
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,560
i think was your instagram video you

1123
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,079
made on nitrogen

1124
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,599
and i believe it was something along the

1125
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,400
lines of like 18

1126
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,680
of the energy has to do with converting

1127
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
can you talk to us a little bit about

1128
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:01,598
that

1129
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:05,920
yeah so um

1130
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:09,920
what happens in the plant is the plant

1131
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:13,039
uptakes either ammonium

1132
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,320
or nitrate or amino acids

1133
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:17,759
which is an organic form of nitrogen so

1134
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,920
there's a third form of nitrogen that

1135
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,160
the plant can uptake

1136
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,079
and again they act totally different

1137
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:25,679
depending on what happens when it comes

1138
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,480
to nitrate which is

1139
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,118
what the vast majority of nitrogen is

1140
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,639
taken up

1141
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,000
as the plant has to convert that

1142
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,879
nitrogen

1143
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,559
in the form of nitrate into complete

1144
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,400
proteins to actually

1145
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:43,119
put into its leaves so nitrogen is sort

1146
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,119
of the backbone of proteins

1147
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,440
in the plant and so it actually has to

1148
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,200
take that no3 molecule and and make it

1149
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,400
into a protein and that

1150
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:55,759
process is metabolically uh very energy

1151
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,760
intensive and so

1152
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,199
you know i've heard and i heard this in

1153
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,280
a podcast

1154
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:04,319
put out by john kemp i can't i haven't

1155
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,359
been able to validate it in a textbook

1156
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,599
but that upwards of 18 of the plant's

1157
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:12,319
metabolic energy is used to convert

1158
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,440
nitrate into complete proteins

1159
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,720
so in theory there's a there's a sort of

1160
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,400
a hack

1161
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:20,639
and that is that if you can feed the

1162
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,200
plants amino acids

1163
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:25,039
so amino acids are the building blocks

1164
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:27,759
of proteins if you can feed them

1165
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:29,279
a soluble amino acid that they uptake

1166
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,640
they don't have to convert it into

1167
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,400
proteins they don't just spend as much

1168
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:33,838
energy because it's already in that

1169
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,960
building block

1170
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:39,920
of an amino acid and so i really like

1171
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,519
um there's a there's like a soluble

1172
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,000
there's a number of soluble organic

1173
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:44,079
amino

1174
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,519
acid products that are in liquid form

1175
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,359
that you can feed your plants i like

1176
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:48,880
soluble soybean meal there's like four

1177
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:50,559
different brands

1178
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,160
that are probably all manufactured by

1179
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:53,119
the same company and just branded

1180
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,000
differently

1181
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,920
but the theory goes that if your plants

1182
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,679
are uptaking those amino acids

1183
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,119
it's saving a bunch of energy that they

1184
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,440
can put toward

1185
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,240
shoot growth or flower development or

1186
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,679
root growth

1187
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:11,039
or any number of metabolic

1188
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:13,118
activities so

1189
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,519
i'm not sure if that actually works

1190
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,440
there's no way to actually test that

1191
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:18,800
i do know that plants perform extremely

1192
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,240
well when you feed them

1193
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,119
soluble amino acids but the question is

1194
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:25,118
really do the

1195
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,800
do the roots uptake at first or do the

1196
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,119
microbes get it first because

1197
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,160
if it goes in the soil and the microbes

1198
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,280
um

1199
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:32,879
get it first then they're going to

1200
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,640
convert it into ammonium and then

1201
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,800
nitrate and the plants going to have to

1202
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:39,118
convert it back into amino acids but if

1203
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,599
the plants can uptake it in amino acid

1204
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,680
form

1205
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,640
it's definitely definitely a superior

1206
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:44,799
way to go

1207
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:46,559
gotcha okay yeah that's that's really

1208
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,318
good information i was

1209
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:50,239
super intrigued when i heard that you

1210
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:52,239
know amino acids hack

1211
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:54,159
i'm hearing more and more about amino

1212
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:55,519
acids and how they're beneficial

1213
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:57,358
and i know there are some nutrient

1214
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,880
companies that are they're using them

1215
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:00,400
as kind of like a primary thing for

1216
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,039
uptake so um

1217
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,920
that's super cool yeah and i also

1218
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:06,079
mentioned that they're the most

1219
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,639
efficient form of foliar for nitrogen so

1220
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,720
if you're gonna

1221
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:10,480
if you're gonna apply nitrogen foliar um

1222
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:11,039
you wanna you want to be an amino acid

1223
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,719
form

1224
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:16,639
um and yeah they're definitely more

1225
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:19,598
expensive

1226
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:21,118
but at the end of the day almost all of

1227
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,800
these organic amendments are

1228
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:26,960
in protein or amino acid form and

1229
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,800
because they're dry and in chunks if you

1230
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,800
can imagine soybean meal or any kind of

1231
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,640
meal feather meal blood meal

1232
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,280
they're going to get there the microbes

1233
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:37,279
have to have to mineralize them

1234
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,880
but in a liquid amino form it's much

1235
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,200
better

1236
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,920
so yeah they're very popular really if

1237
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,318
you ferment

1238
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,838
any organic substance it's going to end

1239
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:48,480
up in amino acid form

1240
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:49,599
interesting let's move on let's talk uh

1241
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,280
let's get a little bit deeper into

1242
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,720
phosphorus can you tell us a little bit

1243
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,640
about phosphorus i want you to know

1244
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,719
about it yeah phosphorus is

1245
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:58,318
the primary function that i think of is

1246
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:00,480
just energy transfer so

1247
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:01,440
so phosphorus is the you know the

1248
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,880
primary

1249
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,559
uh element in atp which is kind of the

1250
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,519
the energy transfer uh

1251
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:12,559
money in in cells so all metabolic

1252
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:14,239
processes need

1253
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,000
energy phosphorus is the main energy

1254
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:18,078
source um

1255
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,760
you know phosphorus isn't needed in as

1256
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,920
high as quant

1257
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,000
in as high of quantity as most people

1258
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,760
think and actually if you push nitrogen

1259
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,239
traditionally people have pushed knight

1260
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,680
or i'm sorry phosphorus way too hard

1261
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:31,598
and that can create major environmental

1262
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:33,440
issues especially outside so

1263
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,519
i don't necessarily believe in in really

1264
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,280
pushing soluble phosphorus in outdoor

1265
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,679
environments because it really

1266
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,440
it's leaky it leaves the farm it leaves

1267
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:42,799
the garden and ends up in ecosystems and

1268
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,240
really wreaks havoc

1269
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,519
so phosphorus is super important and

1270
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:49,358
there you definitely need to have a

1271
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:50,480
certain concentration of phosphorus in

1272
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,880
the root system

1273
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,559
for root growth and for flower

1274
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,720
development and

1275
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:59,039
for just reproductive energy in general

1276
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:02,000
but i think it's oftentimes overdone

1277
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:03,599
in uh conventional systems especially

1278
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,199
with people are using phosphoric

1279
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:10,318
acid or monoammonium phosphate or

1280
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:12,639
you know triple superfos but underdone

1281
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:15,039
in organic systems

1282
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:16,639
so i like to i like to have luxurious

1283
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:19,920
levels of phosphorus

1284
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:21,440
in organic systems yeah i've heard that

1285
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,760
in some of these bottled nutrient lines

1286
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,720
in particular that they way over doing

1287
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,040
phosphorus

1288
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:29,279
that it's just it's an overkill and then

1289
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:30,800
people are adding pk boosters on top of

1290
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,240
it and flowering and that's

1291
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,640
causing problems down the line now will

1292
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:37,598
phosphorus in excess of that will that

1293
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:40,318
lock out other

1294
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,039
nutrients you know it takes a lot it

1295
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:43,279
takes a lot

1296
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,318
i mean hydroponically we have to have

1297
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,400
100 ppm

1298
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:48,239
to start but but absolutely it'll start

1299
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,599
to antagonize or lock out other

1300
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:53,598
nutrients such as zinc

1301
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:55,680
iron uh a lot of the i mean it's a

1302
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,640
it's an anion so it'll lock out any

1303
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:58,960
cationic

1304
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:00,239
micronutrient which is zinc iron

1305
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,280
manganese

1306
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:04,719
um and copper but really zinc and iron

1307
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,480
are the ones to be

1308
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:10,719
uh aware of the most okay

1309
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,760
uh moving on potassium talk to us a

1310
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:13,598
little bit about potassium yeah

1311
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,319
potassium is a fascinating one

1312
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,960
potassium is responsible in the plant

1313
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:18,559
for

1314
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,240
and by the way when i when i do this

1315
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,078
very quick overview of what these things

1316
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:23,598
do in the plant

1317
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,760
these three nutrients really all the

1318
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,079
macronutrients are ubiquitous

1319
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,160
they have so many roles in the plants

1320
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,920
that you would have to be a phd in plant

1321
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:34,318
physiology to even understand all the

1322
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,800
different roles of potassium so

1323
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:39,358
high level stuff um i'm saying what they

1324
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,599
do maybe one or two things but

1325
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:43,519
they they have their hand in almost

1326
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,760
every metabolic function

1327
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:46,960
but when i think of potassium i think of

1328
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,560
um

1329
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,760
the it's it's like cell balance so the

1330
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,960
opening and closing

1331
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,240
of stomata and the movement of nutrients

1332
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,440
through the xylem

1333
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:00,719
and the translocation of nutrients and

1334
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,358
carbohydrates

1335
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:05,519
it's all about potassium because it's

1336
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:07,519
it's um

1337
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:09,358
it's a very high concentration cation

1338
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:12,719
that helps open and close

1339
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:14,559
um cells so

1340
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:17,679
yeah potassium is very important it's

1341
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:20,159
also as if people who

1342
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:21,919
are growing for flowering flowering

1343
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:23,838
plants know that

1344
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,838
whether you're trying to size up an

1345
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:28,559
apple or a tomato

1346
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:29,920
or a medicinal flower you you need to

1347
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,039
have a lot of potassium in the

1348
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,760
reproductive

1349
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,039
state so to me there's this very

1350
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,960
interesting relationship

1351
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:38,719
that i focus on a lot between calcium

1352
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,000
and potassium they're both cations with

1353
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:41,679
positive charges

1354
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,679
and they're both very antagonistic to

1355
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:46,239
one another so i like to really

1356
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:47,118
push calcium and veg and try to maximize

1357
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:49,519
the plant

1358
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,960
uptake of calcium and then in flour when

1359
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:52,960
you're really trying to fill flour and

1360
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,720
hit yield and create density you want to

1361
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,440
you want to switch that ratio and really

1362
00:45:54,719 --> 00:46:00,480
be pushing potassium

1363
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,599
so yeah potassium in the soluble form

1364
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,559
there's a number of different

1365
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,920
organic products um i was about to say

1366
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,880
potassium silicate

1367
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,960
it's actually not considered organic

1368
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,240
unless you're using it for ipm but

1369
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,039
i don't have any issue with it

1370
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:16,719
whatsoever but potassium sulfate is what

1371
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:19,920
i tend to recommend

1372
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:21,519
and you can really push potassium levels

1373
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,920
up i've noticed that it has a bit of a

1374
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:25,440
of a delayed effect so if you want to

1375
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,440
size a flower

1376
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,039
it's not going to be a 24 hour effect

1377
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,240
you should be applying it like

1378
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:33,679
weeks in advance of when um the flowers

1379
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:35,759
are really sizing so

1380
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:36,799
uh the rule of thumb i use is like a lot

1381
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,839
of

1382
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,280
growers uh understand the idea of like

1383
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,960
the plants stretch like

1384
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,640
at the end of stretch that's when i

1385
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,400
really hammer down on potassium

1386
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:48,078
okay and then yeah there are some

1387
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,079
growers out there that swear by

1388
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,880
potassium towards the end of flowering

1389
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,760
they're just

1390
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,119
absolutely yeah um so and i do too i

1391
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,560
think that's critically important

1392
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,240
the interesting part was there is you

1393
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:00,000
said after stretch is really when you

1394
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:00,799
want to start to apply it so when would

1395
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,719
you stop

1396
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,160
applying it a couple weeks before

1397
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:06,239
harvest okay i mean

1398
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:08,318
it it totally depends on your and this

1399
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:10,239
is why soil testing is so important

1400
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:12,400
it depends on your soil levels right if

1401
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:15,519
you go into flour and you're at

1402
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,599
where you are at 2 2 30 i don't think

1403
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:21,199
i'd apply potassium i think that's great

1404
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:24,318
um but in a perfect world your your

1405
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:27,199
calcium's at 170 your mags at 35

1406
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:27,920
your potassium is like under a hundred

1407
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:29,679
and then

1408
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,838
and then once you enter flour you've got

1409
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:33,358
to get that up to over 200 so that's

1410
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:34,159
when you really just got to hammer down

1411
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:36,078
on it

1412
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:38,480
so it depends on where your soil's at

1413
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:40,240
and it depends on the tissue levels too

1414
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,240
like if you haven't loaded calcium then

1415
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:43,838
you may not need as much potassium

1416
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:45,279
um so it's important to kind of

1417
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:47,440
understand that it's it's hard to give a

1418
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,480
set recommendation but in general

1419
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,079
in general feeding potassium

1420
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,358
is going to help and it's the

1421
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,559
interesting thing about potassium is

1422
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:57,598
it's not going to hurt

1423
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:59,760
so plants

1424
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,280
like potassium won't lock anything out

1425
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,119
it won't antagonize anything because

1426
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,480
plants most plants have

1427
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,838
um the ability to to uptake luxury

1428
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,519
levels of potassium

1429
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:10,960
so they can just keep up taking it they

1430
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,719
can eat it like candy

1431
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,960
and just store it in vacuoles or in

1432
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:16,000
different cellular constituents and and

1433
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,240
not use it

1434
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,440
but they like to just uptake it in

1435
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:23,039
luxury levels

1436
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:26,720
and it's not gonna tie anything up um

1437
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:28,159
so it's not gonna hurt to feed potassium

1438
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:29,519
and flour and i and i don't

1439
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,118
have an issue saying that because i

1440
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:32,318
don't think it's a major environmental

1441
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:34,480
concern outdoors

1442
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:35,599
so if someone's slamming down on a

1443
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,000
phosphorus

1444
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,599
during flower that bothers me someone's

1445
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,358
slamming down on potassium

1446
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,519
excessively it's it's not that big of a

1447
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:45,920
deal okay i did want to touch

1448
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,280
on one more thing and that is heavy

1449
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,159
metals

1450
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,040
so i know you did the the talk with tad

1451
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,118
hussey

1452
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:54,400
you went into detail with heavy metals i

1453
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,599
know like on the commercial facility

1454
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,680
side of things it's

1455
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,519
it's pretty important i mean they can

1456
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:01,838
fail testing

1457
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:03,119
for heavy metals now on the homegrown

1458
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:05,519
side of things we don't really

1459
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,280
hear about that much but can you talk to

1460
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:08,159
us about heavy metals and soil and

1461
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,359
plants

1462
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:11,118
yeah so the interesting thing about

1463
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:11,838
heavy metals is i think that it's it's a

1464
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,960
little bit over

1465
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:18,159
hyped but but

1466
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,240
not over hyped the the issue is

1467
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:21,598
if you fail your tests you have huge

1468
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:23,919
economic loss

1469
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,760
so they're so it's this this high risk

1470
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,800
low probability event

1471
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:31,280
and those are the worst um

1472
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,960
that's what that's usually in life where

1473
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,440
there's a high risk low probability

1474
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,880
event

1475
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:39,519
you buy insurance so like you know

1476
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,519
for a fire or whatever but you can't buy

1477
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:44,639
heavy metal insurance so

1478
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:47,358
the the goal is you just try to minimize

1479
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:49,519
a few risk factors that may be

1480
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:52,639
contributing to heavy metal failure the

1481
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:55,599
first obviously is genetics

1482
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,719
you know plants medicinal plants are

1483
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,720
often

1484
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:00,719
just natural hyper accumulators and

1485
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:04,078
different different

1486
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:06,558
uh cultivars have a much higher

1487
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,800
proclivity to accumulate heavy metals so

1488
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:12,319
so part of the failure issue is just

1489
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:14,000
growers have just certain cultivars that

1490
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:16,159
unfortunately accumulate it in high

1491
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,599
quantities but beyond that

1492
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:22,879
there are certain inputs that

1493
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:25,519
bring in heavy metals and

1494
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,200
and there are certain soil conditions

1495
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:30,480
specifically

1496
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:32,078
ph and redox which is like how saturated

1497
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,079
your soil is

1498
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,079
that will influence the uptake of heavy

1499
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,440
metals so usually heavy metals are

1500
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,599
coming in through

1501
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,519
a bad compost source so oftentimes

1502
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,599
historically biosolids

1503
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:45,599
have a lot of high so compost made from

1504
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:48,160
biosolids which is like municipal

1505
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:50,000
sewage sludge have a lot of heavy metals

1506
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:51,519
which sounds disgusting but

1507
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,280
it's interesting the stuff performs

1508
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,759
super well i've used it

1509
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,680
it's it performs extremely well but it

1510
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,160
often has higher heavy metals

1511
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:02,078
inputs like kelp meal which is such a

1512
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:03,199
staple in the organic program for most

1513
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,280
growers

1514
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:07,118
can have it pretty much always has

1515
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,760
elevated arsenic so a little bit

1516
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,240
a little bit is fine but if you're

1517
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,720
applying

1518
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:15,358
huge amounts of kelp meal you could

1519
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:17,598
start seeing failures

1520
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:19,679
again depending on the cultivar soft

1521
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,160
rock phosphate and rock dust which are

1522
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,639
mined

1523
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:24,078
products often have elevated heavy

1524
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:25,838
metals it's kind of brand

1525
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,119
specific from my research so you just

1526
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:27,759
want to make sure you're sourcing the

1527
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,240
right

1528
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,760
amendments um i help growers source

1529
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:33,598
amendments that have been screened

1530
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,880
and they have the the lowest levels of

1531
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,440
heavy metals if they're going to get

1532
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,200
tested

1533
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,880
and then it kind of depends on the state

1534
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:42,318
right because some states don't test

1535
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,240
some do and sometimes

1536
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:46,800
the the levels can be really rigorous

1537
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:50,318
some s states test for barium

1538
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,200
some don't so it's kind of again context

1539
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:52,800
specific

1540
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:54,558
then the final thing is just foliars

1541
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:58,000
most most people

1542
00:51:54,559 --> 00:52:00,079
avoid foliar applying their um

1543
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,119
final product whether that's a vegetable

1544
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:04,480
a melon

1545
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:09,358
or a flower and um so if you're fully

1546
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:11,519
applying kelp meal on your flowers

1547
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:12,960
you're gonna you have a hundred times

1548
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:16,000
higher likelihood of failing

1549
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,280
than if you aren't so

1550
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,559
you just wanna be very conscious of

1551
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,440
foliage and then all the branded

1552
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:24,559
nutrients just

1553
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,960
any org certified organic product

1554
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,880
has to get tested they have to meet

1555
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,720
certain i would say fairly rigorous

1556
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,119
standards for heavy metals

1557
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:33,759
and so i'm i have the heavy metal levels

1558
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,800
of all

1559
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,000
organic products at my disposal and so i

1560
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,160
can actually just look

1561
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,039
if a product's not certified organic and

1562
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:43,199
it's from some

1563
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:44,719
bottled nutrient company you have no

1564
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:46,318
idea and so

1565
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:48,399
if you're really trying to minimize that

1566
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:49,920
risk you really need to either have

1567
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,400
those products tested

1568
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,440
um or i would say demand from the

1569
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,400
manufacturer that

1570
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,200
you get test results or you need to

1571
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,800
eliminate them

1572
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:00,399
and so what i do is i help growers use

1573
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,240
the raw mineral ingredients and put

1574
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,920
together customized fertility programs

1575
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:05,199
so they can get off bottle nutrients

1576
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,639
i'm not saying i mean i have bottle

1577
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:08,239
nutrients in my shed right now just

1578
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:08,799
because if i need to do a quick fix i

1579
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:11,199
can

1580
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,160
just slam it with something quick but

1581
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:13,838
ultimately

1582
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:15,279
i'd say that's a big question mark in

1583
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:16,480
commercial operations in terms of

1584
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,359
figuring out where heavy metals are

1585
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,800
coming from

1586
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:20,558
final thing i'll mention is that logan

1587
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,200
labs does heavy metal testing they do

1588
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,559
all the epa 503 heavy metals so for 150

1589
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:25,759
bucks you can test your soil and

1590
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,240
actually see

1591
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,319
what the heavy metal levels are in

1592
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:33,519
addition to the nutrient analysis

1593
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:35,599
um so those are my thoughts i have more

1594
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:39,119
thoughts that get more technical but

1595
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:41,280
honestly i don't think it's that

1596
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,800
it's it's too theoretical like i

1597
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,839
understand when cadmium becomes

1598
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,760
available

1599
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:47,519
but i don't think it's a relevant

1600
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,359
conversation to the home grower

1601
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:51,119
or even to the commercial grower because

1602
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:53,199
certain things just are out of the

1603
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,720
out of control of a grower like you're

1604
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:56,879
not going to change the redox state of

1605
00:53:54,719 --> 00:54:00,078
your soil it's just not

1606
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,800
realistic gotcha gotcha really good

1607
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,680
stuff there

1608
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,720
for sure so wrapping things up how can

1609
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:06,399
the listeners find you

1610
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:07,679
and is there anything special you got

1611
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,800
upcoming in the future that you want to

1612
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:11,519
talk about

1613
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,960
um i've got a i've got a number of

1614
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:14,960
things in the works that i can't wait to

1615
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,240
launch i'm not talking about them yet um

1616
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,280
but there's some really exciting things

1617
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:18,078
that i'm going to launch in the next

1618
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,559
year

1619
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,359
and i'd say the best way to follow me is

1620
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,280
on instagram

1621
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:24,639
um soil underscore doctor i haven't

1622
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,400
posted for a while because the busy

1623
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:27,759
season just sweeps me away i'm starting

1624
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,680
an orchard i'm helping hundreds of

1625
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,400
growers i'm not producing content but i

1626
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:32,239
will be

1627
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,838
as things slow down so follow me on

1628
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:37,118
instagram

1629
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:38,639
you can order soil audits consulting

1630
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,280
phone calls anything you want on my

1631

new episodes are released i release

1646
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:05,920
every single weekend

1647
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:07,598
so either saturday or sunday usually

1648
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,200
it's saturday but if susan

1649
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,798
over youtube decides that she needs to

1650
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:13,118
manually review a video

1651
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:14,719
it'll come out on sunday instead so also

1652
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:17,358
if you're listening on apple podcast

and lastly sharing that's probably one

1658
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,119
of the biggest things you can do is

1659
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:29,838
share this podcast reddit is a good

1660
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,079
place to share

1661
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:34,639
facebook groups is a good place to share

1662

share this podcast

1664
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,359
brian thank you so much for coming on to

1665
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:41,838
the podcast today i have learned

1666
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:43,039
so much and uh there's a really a lot of

1667
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,639
knowledge here that i think is going to

1668
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:46,960
help out the audience so
