1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,600
it's a little different when you're

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,278
running um CO2 because I also don't just

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:09,160
if I want if I can avoid it I don't want

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:11,559
to just dump all my CO2 straight out of

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,759
the window yes and that's I think where

6
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:16,000
a lot of people steer themselves the

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,320
wrong way is they'll supplement CO2 but

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,160
then they'll have their inline fan kick

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,240
on and exhaust it all out of the grow

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,800
space yeah so let's get into CO2 a

11
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,439
little bit deeper here how do you

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,880
supplement CO2 using the tanks or you us

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,599
in one of the other methods before um

14
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:34,960
I've used I've never tried the little

15
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,238
cans but I have tried the um uh what are

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,399
they called I can't remember the name

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:42,479
but the little mycelium

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,120
bags I've had those I've ran them more

19
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,718
than they recommend you to run them like

20
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,159
more in my space than they say you

21
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:52,679
need and it seemed like for me

22
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,439
personally in my limited experience I

23
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,840
could never really get the PPM of CO2 I

24
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,718
was looking for I think the highest I

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,680
ever got with three of those bags in a

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:06,359
5x5 tent was like 860

27
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:08,640
PPM so now I have got I just run a 20 lb

28
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,438
tank I have a 20 lb tank right outside

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,840
of my tent I have a automatic controller

30
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:16,839
that goes in the tent there's a little

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,680
fan in that controller that's always

32
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:23,079
pulling air through the box and getting

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,159
a CO2 rating on it and I can set my high

34
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:30,919
and low and so then if I set my low to

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:34,399
say 800 and my high to 1,400

36
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,840
as soon as the CO2 dips below 800 the

37
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,680
electronic valve will open and that tank

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,240
will start leaking out CO2 it's just

39
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,040
piped in through a little small air hose

40
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:45,199
just run right to the very top of my

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,560
tent cu the CO2 is really heavy so I

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,280
running up top the goal is to have it

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,920
fall down and as it's falling through

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,359
the canopy all these fans towards the

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,439
bottom of the tent are just going to

46
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:59,159
keep it moving all around the leaf

47
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:01,839
surfaces so they can just use it all the

48
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,520
time because you're Leaf can really only

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,880
use the CO2 that is like right there

50
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:09,159
touching the leaf surface on the top and

51
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,919
the bottom so I always want to be moving

52
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:14,560
it around but after you get it set up

53
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,359
after I have this set up it was a little

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,598
expensive to set up the controller is a

55
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,360
little expensive the valve isn't very

56
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,119
expensive but the electronic controller

57
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,000
is and that first CO2

58
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,759
tank I think was close to 200 bucks but

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,439
the way it works is it's just an

60
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:34,399
exchange program so now every time I

61
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:38,560
want to go get more CO2 I just take my

62
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,439
empty tank to the um grow shop drop it

63
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,920
off and pick up a new one like they

64
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:45,000
don't like refill it or anything they

65
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:48,518
have full ones there waiting on you and

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,919
that price to refill that is very very

67
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:54,080
small like um I'm paying like under I

68
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,958
think it's like $15 I can't remember

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,920
exactly it's so small that I don't even

70
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,680
know the exact price cuz usually when I

71
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:04,759
add it to whatever I'm getting from the

72
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,719
grow store like I can't I'm not sure how

73
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:07,959
much it costs you know it under 20 bucks

74
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:12,439
is all I

75
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:17,319
know but for the potential that you can

76
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:18,759
get in your growth um and not just your

77
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:20,719
growth because it's not always about

78
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:22,120
biomass it's not always always about

79
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:26,359
plant

80
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:28,840
size to me I like the CO2 really because

81
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,439
it makes my plant it just seems to make

82
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,319
the plant more party in every way I can

83
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:36,479
imagine it seems to make it more

84
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,958
resilient to Drought stress more

85
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,039
resilient to heat stress more resilient

86
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,959
to Pest and

87
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:47,560
pathogens and if I can get faster plant

88
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,080
growth that's always great even if I'm

89
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,680
not going for a bigger plant always like

90
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,439
to get to harvest you know quicker if I

91
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,438
can save a little time that's always

92
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:58,598
great it gives me time to start a new

93
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:01,078
round it's super beneficial I know

94
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:03,238
there's a study out of University where

95
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,120
they ran, 1400 PPM in the flowering

96
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,039
stage and they got a 30% increase in

97
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,000
yield I saw that I saw um that I I think

98
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,759
it was debacco University covered that

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
on his YouTube channel and when you see

100
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:16,279
those

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,600
pictures of those plants you're like

102
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,159
well that's clear that's clear as day

103
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,840
that's the clearest thing I've ever seen

104
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,919
like there's no way I'm going to it's

105
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:27,879
when you realize it and for me it was

106
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,918
really like what really made me look

107
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:32,120
into it is when I realized how many any

108
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,599
of these big commercial

109
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,759
facilities might cut Corners to save

110
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,039
money here and there and there and there

111
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,560
and they're cutting Corners to save

112
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:43,680
money wherever they can but never ever

113
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,680
ever on the CO2 the CO2 is running all

114
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,160
day every day really high 1400 1500

115
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,560
ppms and it's because they've seen it

116
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,560
it's because they've had a room that had

117
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,160
a few hundred plants in it and then they

118
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,519
had a room right beside it with a few

119
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,199
hundred plants in it and they only had

120
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:04,359
enough CO2 one around to run it in one

121
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,080
room and they saw the difference in

122
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,520
these two rooms and they were like okay

123
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:12,959
that was huge that was a that was 30%

124
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,918
more money came out of the same size

125
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:18,198
room we can never make that mistake

126
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:19,839
again yeah so super beneficial a lot of

127
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,038
uh a lot of good can come out of it

128
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:24,839
although it is a upfront cost you

129
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:26,199
mentioned $200 for the tank to be plus

130
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:28,638
hundreds of dollars for the controller

131
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,680
valve all that stuff but pids for itself

132
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,560
pretty quickly there yeah I think so are

133
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,680
you running it daytime only uh a lot of

134
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,680
people will will just do CO2 in the

135
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,519
daytime and they'll uh say ignore it

136
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,639
during nighttime yeah um the controller

137
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:47,839
I have is actually set up to run exactly

138
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,199
that way so it has it's monitoring two

139
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,758
things at the same time the first one is

140
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,280
the fan that pulls the air through and

141
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,600
reads the actual ppms of the CO2 the

142
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,879
second thing is just a little light

143
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,439
monitor right on the front of the

144
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:04,478
controller box so and you put that

145
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,519
inside of your tent and so anytime there

146
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:09,159
isn't a very bright light source like if

147
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:11,680
your grow light isn't turned on then

148
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,319
that thing just defaults to stay off all

149
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,439
night long so all during the night or

150
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,960
all during lights off it's not putting

151
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,199
out any CO2 at all and then as soon as

152
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,038
the lights come on in the morning it

153
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,280
