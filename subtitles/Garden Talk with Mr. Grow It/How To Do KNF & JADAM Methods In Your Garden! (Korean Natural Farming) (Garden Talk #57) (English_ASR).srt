part b is for flour well our part a is

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:17,278

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,839

16
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,839
many days and then you strain out the

17

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,720
so i'm really like involved in the plant

148
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,120
world and how

149
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,199
natural plants can be used to help

150
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,120

151
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,360
and conditions and just

152
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,120
everyday modern sickness even even just

153
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,280
boosting your immune system if we all

154
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,199
ate more organic plants and spent more

155
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,439
time out in nature and the sunshine and

156
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,199
fresh air it could it could help all of

157
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,800
us heal a lot

158
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,560
so i'm i'm totally into stuff like that

159
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,400
totally into the natural way of doing

160
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,879
things with you which is cool because

161
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:54,000
more sustainable way to do things it

162
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,478
arguably a cheaper way to do things

163
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,600
yep yes

164
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,079
exactly

165
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,280
so there's so many benefits to going

166
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,318
that route

167
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,839
now when we talk about k f in particular

168
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,240
don't assume my audience knows what that

169
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:11,359
is can you talk about like what is knf

170
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,918
and what inputs do you do

171
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,038
so um k f stands for korean natural

172
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,120
farming

173
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:20,079
um everything that i have ever learned

174
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,360
about k f i i learned it online by

175
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,719
watching chris trump's youtube videos

176
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,720
and uh you can even check out his

177
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,400
website christtrump.com he's got a lot

178
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,360
of really great information on there

about

180
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,280
what type of inputs you want to use at

181
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,879
what certain times and how you can make

182
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,879
your own inputs

183
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,120
uh that's one of the things i've done um

184
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,279
to kind of like help save money by

185
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,680

186
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:46,879
your garden um there's some things i

187
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,519
have out here that i have made um not

188
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,759
this one ohn

189
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:55,279
this is oriental herbal nutrient it's

190
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:59,280
used for plants animals and humans too

191
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:01,519
it could um ohn helps to like get rid of

192
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,679
pathogens diseases ailments this could

193
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,918
help boost your immune system you could

194
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,759
take a little bit of this every day

195
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:09,519
i can't open the jar right now because

196
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,520
it it's made with sugar in the

197
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,839
fermentation process and i got some on

198
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,680
the lid and it's stuck

199
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,359
but um

200
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,959
it's really great stuff

201
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,960
humans can take just a little bit every

202
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,519
day to help boost their immune system

203
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,239
you put like about four mils of this

204
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,560
into a gallon of water and water your

205
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,240
plants with it just once in a while

206
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,079
maybe once every couple of weeks or

207
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,639
maybe once a month to help boost their

208
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,399
immune system also if like for your cats

209
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,079
for example or your plants or if you

210
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,679
have livestock you could give just a

211
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,159
little bit of this into the water and

212
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,598
it'll help boost their immune system

213
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,919
so how do you make that how do you go

214
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,399
about making that right there

215
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,399
if you've seen the video he uses big

216
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,079
jugs and i've done the same thing so

217
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,159
i've made

218
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,959
so much i would recommend anyone doing

219
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,720
this at home to try to go with smaller

220
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:04,318
jugs and smaller amounts but um you take

221
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,599
uh ingredients like angelic root

222
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,720
cinnamon

223
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,319
ginger

224
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,000
garlic

225
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,160
and um i i used turmeric too not

226
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,399
everybody uses turmeric in their ohn

227
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,560
recipe but i've used it in mine because

228
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,638
he had recommended it on his youtube

229
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,560
page when or his youtube video and he

230
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,960
made it at the time so i added it into

231
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,639
mine because i did exactly as he did and

232
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,959
uh turmeric is really great for your

233
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,918
heart and your blood anyways so why not

234
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,918
add it in with the rest of your ohn

235
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,038
this is something that's been used for

236
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,360
centuries

237
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,360
um just as a tonic to help people feel

238
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,599
better but it can also be given to like

239
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,038
plants and animals to help their boost

240
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,399
their immune system help them feel

241
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,159
better as well

242
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,320
so um

243
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,399
some of the ingredients are dry you you

244
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,278
rehydrate them by letting them soak in

245
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,759
beer and you can taste uh the different

246
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:59,600
beers and people's different ohns like i

247
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:03,039
have used ipa beer a friend um my friend

248
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,080
matt mile high gardener he had used um

249
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,838
stout

250
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,720
which actually tastes much better than

251
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,360
mine

252
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,440
and uh so the other ingredients once

253
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,120
you're done hydrating those ingredients

254
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,000
you move on to the next step which is to

255
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,360
put all the ingredients into a big jar

256
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,759
of alcohol

257
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,278
and you let that sit for it takes a long

258
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,720
time um

259
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:24,480
like

260
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,639
i forgot how long it took me but it was

261
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,080
over a month i remember i wrote all the

262
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,159
dates down but i went in there every

263
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,399
single day and stirred those jars every

264
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,319
day to mix the ingredients around

265
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,480
um and then you strain it through a

266
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,399
strainer then you put the ingredients

267
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,399
back in and then you fill the jar back

268
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,480
up a third of the way and then you add

269
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,720
more alcohol to the jar

270
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,278
and then you let that sit for another

271
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,120
um i think two weeks or something if you

272
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,799
want more details you gotta check out

273
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,240
his youtube page because it'll have all

274
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,399
the information

275
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,839
and then do you dilute it down before

276
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,200
giving your plants and how often do you

277
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,920
give to the plants

278
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,360
so um this is in this way it's straight

279
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,838
uh alcohol

280
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,800
uh and you would give it like just four

281
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,760
mils

282
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,958
four milliliters per gallon of water

283
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,039
and you don't need to give it to your

284
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,639
plants often maybe if you gave it to

285
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,120
them once a week once every other week

286
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,078
would be fine foliar spraying is great

287
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,159
too

288
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,319
um later on i'll talk about um the

289
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,078
maintenance solution because this is

290
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,000
something that you would mix three

291
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,639
different ingredients

292
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,639
so ohn would be your first ingredient

293
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,958
your second ingredient is fermented

294
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,519
plant juice i've made that fermented

295
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:37,278
plant juice is usually made out of uh

296
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,759
fresh uh roots not roots the fresh

297
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:42,799
shoots that's the word i'm thinking of

298
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:45,838
fermented plant juices um it's a rich

299
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:49,039
enzyme solution made out of um

300
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,079
beneficial biochemicals inside of the

301
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,399
plant

302
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,479
so when you take a a

303
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,839
fresh like say in your backyard you got

304
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,440
weeds and you got a lot of things

305
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,360
growing fast

306
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,839
you go out there early in the morning

307
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,320
and you harvest all of the tips

308
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,800
you put the tips into a big bucket and

309
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,879
you mix it with equal weights of

310
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,719
raw brown sugar

311
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,600
and you mix it together then you take it

312
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,200
in like a jar

313
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,360
you take it in like a jar about this

314
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,519
size and you smash it all down so that

315
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,440
it's all compressed together and then

316
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,679
you put like a breathable lid on top and

317
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,839
you leave it in a cool dark area for

318
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,319
about two weeks depending on the plant

319
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,160
material some plants break down a lot

320
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,160
faster than other plants but basically

321
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:35,120
through that osmotic pressure and

322
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:37,278
fermentation the sugar starts eating

323
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,120
away at the plant and it starts

324
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,600
releasing

325
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,440
all of this great chemical compound in a

326
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,680
liquid form and then you strain off and

327
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,160
you collect the liquid form

328
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,679
and you could use that liquid form same

329
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:53,120
thing as um

330
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,239
pohn about four mils per gallon

331
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,200
so there's two different things that

332
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,399
fermented plant the fermented plant

333
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,440
juice is made out of like fresh leaves

334
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,240
fresh tips greens so you're using that

335
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,440
to

336
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,079
as an input for your veg side of things

337
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,920
to help your plants grow fast in their

338
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,838
veg stage

339
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,278
there's another thing called fermented

340
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,959
fruit juice

341
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,958
i made this one nope

342
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,959
fermented fruit juice this is made out

343
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,039
of

344
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,119
fruits

345
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:28,799
like with the fruits you're

346
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,278
getting out all of the

347
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,639
nutrients and and chemical compounds in

348
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,278
those fruits that are letting your

349
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,919
plants know it's time to make more fruit

350
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,838
so same process you cut up your fruits

351
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,919
you mix it in with equal weights of raw

352
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,240
brown sugar you

353
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,078
put push it in a in a jar with a

354
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,000
breathable lid and you give it like a

355
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,519
couple of weeks for the fermentation

356
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,078
process to do its thing and then you

357
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,440
strain it out and you keep the liquid

358
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,679
the liquid uh for fermented

359
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,440
uh fermented fruit juice

360
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,519
that's about eight mils when you're in

361
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,519
flour

362
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,360
so um

363
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,639
fermented plant juice ohn and brown rice

364
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,680
vinegar

365
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,799
um you could make it if you want i just

366
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,319
buy this

367
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:18,958
off of amazon it's brown rice vinegar

368
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,600
this has so many great um

369
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,518
qualities just this alone how helpful it

370
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,759
is for your plants

371
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,679
um it's basically like

372
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:28,639
a cleanser

373
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,519
so

374
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,079
that

375
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,480
brown rice vinegar plus ohn plus

376
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:37,199
fermented plant juice is all added

377
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,199
together to make a maintenance solution

378
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,600
so when you you could order these

379
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,759
products by the way off of somebody that

380
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,040
you know like

381
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,278
who's making them there's a lot of

382
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,039
people making k f products and selling

383
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,480
them so if you don't want to make it

384
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,958
yourself but you want to give it a try

385
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,800
totally buy it off of them this is my um

386
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,198
k f maintenance solution it's those

387
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:59,519
three ingredients ohn fermented plant

388
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:01,679
juice and brown rice vinegar mixed

389
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,519
together so if i wanted to give my

390
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,239
plants a boost i'd give them just a

391
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,278
little bit of this 20 mils per gallon

392
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,879
uh soil drench or foliar spray is fine

393
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:13,039
just a little bit you don't need to

394
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:16,439
overdo it how often do you do the

395
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,439
maintenance solution

396
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,359
if i was

397
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,078
so you i don't think that you need to do

398
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,120
it if you're foliar spraying and also

399
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,879
doing a soil drench then

400
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,959
maybe one or the other

401
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,919
if you're doing it just once a week it's

402
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,439
fine

403
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:34,958
uh when you go on a flower you don't

404
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,120
want to foliar spray anymore you want to

405
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,359
put it in the soil once a week is fine

406
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,039
once every other week is fine too

407
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,800
also i've made water-soluble calcium

408
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,039
well actually sorry before we move on to

409
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,838
that i did have question about

410
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,919
the

411
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,760
fermented plant juice so just to kind of

412
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,599
quick recap

413
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,198
four milliliters per gallon for the

414
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,000
fermented plant juice

415
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:00,559
and that is going to mostly be veg human

416
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,919
during the vegetation stage and then the

417
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,919
fruit

418
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,399
fermented juice

419
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,838
fermented fruit juice would be used

420
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,639
during flower

421
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,480
that's eight milliliters per gallon

422
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,600
so you can use them individually or you

423
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,560
can make that

424
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,000
um

425
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:17,599
maintenance solution that you spoke

426
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,559
about right so you can do either or

427
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,360
right

428
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,439
yeah

429
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,039
um the maintenance solution that i've

430
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,040
made is only with the fermented plant

431
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,120
juice

432
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,039
so okay gotcha

433
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,399
not the fermented fruit juice that does

434
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,399
kind of get a bit confusing

435
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,480
that makes sense you could totally use

436
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:41,039
just fermented um fruit juice

437
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,560
with a water and just water that to your

438
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,919
plants

439
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:47,919
the ohn and uh is is kind of used

440
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,599
sparingly

441
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,439
same thing with the uh brown rice

442
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,959
vinegar just a little bit you don't need

443
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,560
to add it all the time but it's

444
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,758
definitely beneficial to have it in

445
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,758
there

446
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,639
so let's say you're doing bottled

447
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,480
nutrients and you would have your part a

448
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,159
and your part b and your part a is for

449
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,278
veg and then your part b is for flour

450
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:12,078
well our part a is fermented plant juice

451
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:14,000
and our part b is fermented fruit juice

452
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,439
there's also um

453
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,278
you could use all sorts of types of

454
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,199
different fruits to make the fermented

455
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,679
fruit juice i heard you should probably

456
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:22,559
stay away from citric fruits

457
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,559
and

458
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,399
pineapple

459
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,159
but

460
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,919
my friend that does fermented plant

461
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,360
extracts makes this fermented pumpkin

462
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,360
so if you didn't want to make it

463
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,039
yourself you could buy it off of

464
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,360
somebody else

465
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:41,120
and then same thing this one's like the

466
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,079
comfrey

467
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,120
this one you would use in veg this one i

468
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:47,120
would use in flour

469
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:50,078
so

470
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,039
you get things from building soil don't

471
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,559
you

472
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:56,319
oh yeah yep definitely uh

473
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,000
juice or

474
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,079
i have not now that's something i've

475
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,919
been i've been wanting to do so i think

476
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:04,480
maybe this year i'll definitely

477
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,240
experiment with fermented juices

478
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,519
absolutely

479
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,599
yeah what was that other thing that you

480
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,519
were going to show behind you i'll see

481
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,798
i'll cut you off before i cut you off

482
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,279
that's okay

483
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:17,679
water soluble calcium

484
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,519
this is made with um

485
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,839
your eggs you collect all of your

486
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,038
eggshells preferably organic and see if

487
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:24,399
you're doing your own regenerative

488
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,000
farming and you had chickens you would

489
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,798
just use your own chicken eggshells the

490
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,119
best

491
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:30,879
um but what you do is you collect

492
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,599
eggshells and you crush them up and then

493
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,240
you cook them preferably outdoors on a

494
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:39,119
pan until they get like nice and brown

495
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,919
and then you put them into like one of

496
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:44,399
these containers of brown rice vinegar

497
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,080
and you let it soak and ferment for so

498
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,679
many days and then you strain out the

499
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,480
shells and then what you have left over

500
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:53,360
is water soluble calcium

501
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,360
available to be taken up to the plants

502
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,759
love it they'll take it immediately

503
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,798
you mentioned the egg shell should be

504
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,960
laid out

505
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,160
and that you should potentially cook it

506
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,600
outside

507
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,720
so you wouldn't recommend that they do

508
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,798
it inside in like the oven for example

509
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,120
well like on your stove top you could if

510
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,359
you wanted to um for a lot of people it

511
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:16,239
creates a nasty odor so they just prefer

512
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:18,719
to do it outside is all uh

513
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,440
i did mine outside so

514
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,919
i just grabbed a um

515
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,240
one of those cast iron pans

516
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,320
and went outside and

517
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,839
mixed it all around you've got to keep

518
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:34,159
mixing it so it's nice and brown and

519
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:36,879
so if you don't clean out your egg

520
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,440
shells they do kind of have this white

521
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,360
fluffy stuff that needs to be cooked off

522
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,960
you don't want that stuff

523
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:45,439
in your solution

524
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,360
just the eggshell itself not any part of

525
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,360
the embryo or yolk or anything i was

526
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:53,119
going to say is there a specific ratio

527
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:54,399
of eggshells to vinegar

528
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:57,678
um

529
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,679
yes 1 10 egg shells

530
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,600
and the other nine tenths to brown rice

531
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,480
vinegar

532
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,839
okay

533
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,759
and um

534
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,678
that one you would apply a little bit

535
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:11,440
when you first transition your plants

536
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,440
about four mils per gallon later on in

537
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,880
flower when they start

538
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,840
producing

539
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,720
um then you would put um

540
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,319
eight mils per gallon gotcha yeah good

541
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,319
information there i know uh there's

542
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,480
quite a few people who want to ditch the

543
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,439
bottle of calmag and this is the way to

544
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,279
do it right because you're getting

545
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,720
calcium through the eggshells through

546
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,200
this process

547
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,519
so i'm glad you shared that today

548
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:40,080
there's there's other easier ways to add

549
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:41,038
in um magnesium like um epsom salt

550
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,199
so

551
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:45,038
but the the funny thing is everyone's

552
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,279
always saying more calmag when something

553
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,279
goes wrong and it could possibly be a

554
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,960
lockout of another nutrient not that

555
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,399
you're missing that nutrient just that

556
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,558
you added too much of one thing and you

557
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,240
gotta lock out of something else

558
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,079
happen to me

559
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,000
absolutely yeah i mean the running joke

560
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,319
is just add more calmag and it's like

561
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,919
well what type of cal mag is it military

562
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:07,599
calmag

563
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,600
is there a medical grade calmag

564
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,279
what was that one uh skit that people

565
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,720
would say like i have a disease and the

566
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:18,960
only cure is more calmag

567
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,880
there's so many memes out there so funny

568
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,200
i know

569
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,360
so the other stuff um

570
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,480
water-soluble calcium

571
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,918
and

572
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,599
i already showed you my bloom for a

573
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,720
minute

574
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:32,719
sea salt

575
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,159
sea salt is one of the ingredients one

576
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,038
of the k f minerals um and just a little

577
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,919
bit

578
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:39,679
uh

579
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,240
throughout the

580
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,320
whole growth cycle uh i wrote down here

581
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,558
one to two grams of sea salt per liter

582
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:48,240
of water once you measure it out in your

583
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,480
hand then you know how much goes in and

584
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,880
i put it in my water and i let it

585
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,919
swirl around and i put that in

586
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,280
um

587
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,280
this is fish amino acid

588
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,200
i got this off of a friend from

589
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,000
neverwinter farms

590
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,240
this is his faa he's got a buddy that uh

591
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,480
is a fisherman so he goes to his friend

592
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,640
all the time to get fish off of him

593
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,519
he loves fish i'm not a big fan of fish

594
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,640
myself so i would i don't want to go out

595
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,558
there and

596
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,280
go fishing

597
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,480
so if you love fishing but uh let's say

598
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,759
you come home and you're eating up some

599
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,279
parts and you've got a whole bunch of

600
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:24,640
heads and tails left over or whatever

601
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,480
you're not eating

602
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,559
you take all your fish same thing that

603
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,400
you do with the rest of the inputs equal

604
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,158
weights of brown sugar put it in a

605
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,280
bucket shove it down

606
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,520
um let it ferment for a long time fish

607
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,879
amino acid takes a long long long time

608
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,679
to ferment

609
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,159
um but this could be used um all

610
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,320
throughout the growth of your plants a

611
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,559
little bit more uh

612
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,079
during the beginning of your plants

613
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,440
because they need a little bit more of

614
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,839
that nitrogen

615
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,960
not so much towards the end this has a

616
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:56,480
lot of

617
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,558
nitrogen rich

618
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,679
nutrients and enzymes and stuff like

619
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:01,839
that in it

620
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,280
and like for example if i couldn't make

621
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:04,558
it myself you could always buy it off of

622
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,359
somebody else

623
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:10,480
this is conscience natural inputs before

624
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:12,879
i started making my own k f inputs i was

625
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,038
getting his just to test the waters and

626
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,039
to see if i liked it or not

627
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:18,798
and then after that some things are easy

628
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,359
to get the salt's easy to get the brown

629
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,480
rice vinegar is easy to get you could

630
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,399
get this

631
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,440
it's easy to buy it and just give it a

632
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,400
try

633
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,640
if you wanted to grow organically

634
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,038
so these are the k f inputs that i have

635
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,120
been messing around with i i really love

636
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:37,279
it i don't know if it's because i just

637
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:38,798
love making things so much

638
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,399
but i just have a good time making all

639
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:42,319
these inputs

640
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,559
fermented plant juice is my favorite it

641
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:47,038
took me so many tries before i got it

642
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:49,918
right doing fermented

643
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,440
plant juice with leaves

644
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,720
but that depends on which leaves you're

645
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,558
buying some of them break down really

646
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,319
easily and some of them don't and it's a

647
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:58,558
learning process you learn along the way

648
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,119
sometimes just got to jump in and get

649
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,038
your hands wet

650
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:05,678
i also wanted to get into that a little

651
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:07,919
bit leaf mold right i know you spoke

652
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,159
about it a little bit on the live stream

653
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,759
i think it's value added to speak about

654
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,799
it here as well can you talk to us about

655
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:17,919
leaf mold and how you get that

656
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:20,240
this mold is what happens when um you're

657
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,320
like out like under a tree or in the

658
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,319
forest or something like that and all

659
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,000
the branches and all the leaves and

660
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,678
everything that may have grown and then

661
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,319
died and then grown and then died they

662
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,400
all start to collect and they are what

663
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,240
is making up your soil

664
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,400
it's all mulch

665
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,720
so that's another thing why mulch is one

666
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,519
of my favorite things to have around

667
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,200
it's great when it can help keep your

668
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,119
soil moist

669
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,880
uh but even better is the breaking down

670
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,639
of the mulch just because the leaf is

671
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,400
dead doesn't mean that it lost the

672
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,000
nutrients that were inside of it it's

673
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,919
still stored in there

674
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,200
as it breaks down and mulch as it

675
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,038
becomes a leaf mold is when things like

676
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,038
um

677
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,960
fungi and bacteria and other

678
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:05,440
microorganisms start coming in and

679
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,759
decomposing and breaking it all down for

680
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,440
you now when they come in to decompose

681
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,440
and break down those are the guys that

682
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,558
are feeding your plants roots the

683
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,759
nutrients that came out of that mulch

684
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:17,678
so

685
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,519
one reason why we always say to chop and

686
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,159
drop it if you're if you're cutting it

687
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:24,720
off just leave it on the ground or on

688
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,440
your bed whatever setup you got

689
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,679
and just kind of let nature do the rest

690
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,440
as long as you've got a a healthy dose

691
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,400
of microbials

692
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,120
fungi

693
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,480
bacteria

694
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:40,719
nematodes protozoa worms just things

695
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,558
breaking down that matter for you they

696
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,600
do all the work so that you don't have

697
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:45,759
to

698
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,359
so leaf mold there's a few things you

699
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,440
could do to go out to the forest to

700
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:53,038
collect it and bring it back

701
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,038
you could um to don

702
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:59,120
jadon's way of

703
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,798
of grabbing uh microorganisms and

704
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,079
bringing them back into your garden is

705
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,319
to go out

706
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:05,918
and dig preferably under like something

707
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,639
where you've seen a tree that has fallen

708
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,200
down and a lot of dead material has

709
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,520
already decomposed and new life has

710
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,960
already grown on top of it if you dig

711
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,038
underneath that that's where you could

712
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,558
find all the fungi and all the mycelium

713
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:19,359
and that's where you know that you got a

714
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,558
good

715
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:25,278
network of leaf mold soil down there

716
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,359
like it's hardly recognizable anymore it

717
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,519
sort of looks like soil but technically

718
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,479
it's not soil but what is soil made up

719
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,960
of you know it's made up of

720
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,120
mulch that's been decomposed time after

721
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,360
time after time after time

722
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:41,439
and so you grab a handful of that and

723
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:45,038
you could bring it back home and you can

724
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,840
make um jadon microbial solution

725
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:48,240
and

726
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:51,199
sort of the same thing as a compost tea

727
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,000
where that you're giving it some carbs

728
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,240
to feed it like a baked potato a little

729
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,440
bit of that sea salt in the bottom of

730
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,038
the bucket

731
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,640
and

732
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,200
you let it sit in the middle of the

733
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,559
bucket for a few days depending on the

734
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,880
temperature

735
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:10,240
and there'll be a ring around the edge

736
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,000
when the microbes are ready it's like a

737
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,720
i think that that might be an outcome of

738
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,798
yeast or something some type of

739
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,120
action is happening in there that causes

740
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,480
that ring of bubbles to happen and once

741
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,439
you have that ring it's a perfect

742
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,880
opportunity you got to use it

743
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,679
immediately

744
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,400
you take that big bucket of five gallons

745
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,798
you mix it in with maybe another 20 30

746
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,400
gallons of water and you apply that to

747
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:35,440
all of your plants to introduce all

748
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,600
those microbials into your plants

749
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,360
into the soil

750
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:42,480
another way to do it like the korean

751
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:44,000
natural farming way they call it uh imo

752
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,079
which stands for indigenous

753
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,919
microorganisms

754
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:50,240
their way of doing it is by having some

755
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,000
slightly cooked rice in a box and then

756
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,558
you go out to the forest and then you

757
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,240
dig to till you find that area where you

758
00:26:54,558 --> 00:27:01,119
see a lot of mycelium the leaf molds

759
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,200
you hardly recognize the material that's

760
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:06,000
in there anymore but you can tell that

761
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,798
there is a lot of great fungal life down

762
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,480
there

763
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,720
you put your collection box on top of

764
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,200
that and then you kind of not bury it

765
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,360
but cover it up so it's safe from

766
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,120
like bugs and critters or maybe other

767
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:18,319
people walking by wondering what a box

768
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:19,839
is doing there

769
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:21,439
uh leave that for a few days and that

770
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:23,678
also depends on the temperature you're

771
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,278
supposed to be able to take collections

772
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,159
any time of year including the winter

773
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:28,159
time

774
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,159
but um me personally i'm having a really

775
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,399
hard time doing a winter collection

776
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,760
right now because all the places i have

777
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:34,959
tried haven't turned out to be so

778
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:36,960
successful

779
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,720
but um you can't give up just because it

780
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,480
doesn't work out the first time you know

781
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,839
you got to keep trying

782
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,440
but um

783
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,398
when you have a good successful

784
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,278
collection a lot of fungi is growing on

785
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:52,239
top of your rice like a nice white puffy

786
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:54,480
cloud some colors are okay a little bit

787
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,200
a little bit of mix is okay too much of

788
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,720
any one color is not okay

789
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,880
um then

790
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,000
you take that collection you bring it

791
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,799
back home with your moldy rice

792
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,440
and

793
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:10,558
you mix it equal weights with brown

794
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,278
like brown sugar raw brown sugar

795
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,359
and you let that sit in a jar to ferment

796
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,960
that becomes shelf stable so if you

797
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,038
wanted to do several collections you

798
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,200
have all your little jars your shelf

799
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:23,599
stable jars once they've been mixed with

800
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,120
the uh brown sugar

801
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,519
then um

802
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:30,798
there's there's several processes like

803
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:32,319
imo1 and imo2 and imo3 so these are all

804
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,480
the different steps

805
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:37,119
um the next step when you have your

806
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,880
collection is to mix it in water with

807
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:41,038
some other things

808
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,960
i haven't gotten this far yet you mix it

809
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:45,839
in water with some other

810
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,159
stuff like a little bit of labs and i

811
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,199
believe a little bit of the ohn

812
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,278
and

813
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,360
i think sugar i'm not sure if you're

814
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:55,359
adding more sugar to that concoction or

815
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,199
not you're brewing it around kind of

816
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:00,479
like a tea and then you're

817
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,679
using it to water like malted barley and

818
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,120
wood chips

819
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,320
and stuff like that

820
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:08,398
um then that creates like this

821
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,918
pile that could get really hot so you've

822
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:11,278
got to keep turning it every once in a

823
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,200
while to make sure it doesn't get too

824
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:16,159
hot you want to increase its temperature

825
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,440
but not get above a certain temperature

826
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,159
and

827
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,159
eventually what happens after you know

828
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,080
you've turned it enough times and it

829
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,720
cooked and it's cooling down and now

830
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:29,359
it's completely finished you could use

831
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,519
that finished product

832
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,519
to sprinkle around your garden

833
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,759
or you could use it as a tea and it's a

834
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,158
liquid imo

835
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:41,038
but that is a really amazing way to

836
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,159
introduce microorganisms into your soil

837
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:44,398
and you've got to let your

838
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,679
microorganisms do all the work for you

839
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:48,079
you don't have to

840
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,480
continuously add all these ingredients

841
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,798
when your soil is hooked up and it's got

842
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,440
plenty of microorganisms

843
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:58,000
fungi bacteria

844
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,000
nematodes worms anthropods

845
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,200
microanthropods

846
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,359
um protozoa all sorts of cool stuff soil

847
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,319
is is filled with life

848
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,479
and

849
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,960
as a regenerative farmer all you're

850
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,599
doing is maintaining that life

851
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,558
it blows my mind how many practices

852
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:17,839
there are out there that you can do

853
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,398
in order to

854
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:22,959
grow these plants right um so many

855
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:25,119
different ways to do it i'm sure a lot

856
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,120
of these viewers that are or listeners

857
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,798
that are tuning into this

858
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:31,199
their minds are blown because they're so

859
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,278
used to just growing with bottles or

860
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,919
just growing organically using just a

861
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:37,599
blend that they top dress in or are

862
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,440
initially amended in the medium then top

863
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:42,240
dress throughout the grow

864
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,120
but using these other methods

865
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,440
um

866
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:47,038
you can get away with not doing any of

867
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,519
those top dressings

868
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,038
of blends you know not using them at all

869
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,200
or using bottle nutrients at all you

870
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,200
know k f is is

871
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,319
another way to go about it you know and

872
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,679
you can have great success with k f so

873
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,519
absolutely

874
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,399
if you want to learn more about k f

875
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:06,000
you've got to talk to um chris trump

885
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:27,119

886
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:29,119
knowledge

887
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,439
is just extensive uh when it comes to

888
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,959
that and so um yeah thanks for thanks

889
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,960
for hooking it up there

890
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,640
absolutely he knows he knows way more

891
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,200
about knife than i do

892
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,278
um and i'm i'm just very fortunate i had

893
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,319
the pleasure of having him over and

894
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:46,319
showed in my garden and he said to me um

895
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,319
you're doing too much and you need to

896
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:51,038
back off so i was like

897
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:53,278
it didn't it didn't comprehend to me

898
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:54,558
until after some time that i have

899
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,240
learned that

900
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:57,678
the thing about bottle nutrients is you

901
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,120
feel like you have to constantly be

902
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,720
adding something but when you're growing

903
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:02,398
organically you don't have to constantly

904
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,038
be adding stuff it's all right there for

905
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:06,879
you you're just maintaining

906
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:09,919
you know so that's what that's what

907
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,600
makes it real easy for me

908
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,278
well said

909
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,439
let's uh let's flip it up let's talk

910
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:17,839
about composting so i know that's a

911
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,600
topic that you wanted to get into today

912
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:21,599
i do a little bit of composting myself i

913
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:23,918
do very composting so i have just a

914
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:26,639
small i think it's like 20 something

915
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,000
gallon bin uh in my garage

916
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,278
it's winter time right now so

917
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,759
everything's cold and everything's

918
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,440
moving pretty slow but hey i've got

919
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,158
something going i'm sure once the

920
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,519
springtime and summertime uh comes along

921
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,480
and the temperature heats up a little

922
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,679
bit there's going to be a lot more

923
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,278
activity

924
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,360
in my bin

925
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:44,798
but this is something that

926
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:47,359
it's often said that every home grower

927
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,398
should be doing is composting

928
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:50,000
and there's so many different ways to

929
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:52,079
compost right

930
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,679
so vermicomposting what i just explained

931
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,639
is just one way of doing it you could

932
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,000
have a regular compost pile even

933
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,679
outdoors

934
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,599
that's another way to go about it you

935
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,200
want to talk to us about composting like

936
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,678
what you do what you know about it so on

937
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,880
and so forth so um i'm doing some

938
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,880
composting myself i haven't i haven't

939
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,919
reached the point where i've had

940
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,559
my own finished compost product yet if

941
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,720
you can do a composting where you're at

942
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,240
absolutely go for it not everybody has

943
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,759
that opportunity because like let's say

944
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,880
you live in an apartment or something

945
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:27,038
like that if you needed to buy compost

946
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,919
online you absolutely could same thing

947
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:32,000
with like vermicompost and worm castings

948
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,000
i just highly recommend that if you are

949
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,960
going to be purchasing it from somebody

950
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,798
else

951
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,038
right now during the winter time is the

952
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:41,200
perfect time to go ahead and place that

953
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:43,599
order because of the temperatures are so

954
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,960
cold this time of year if you try doing

955
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:46,558
it during the summer time you don't know

956
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,399
how long that bag has been sitting out

957
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,240
in the sun for so all those great

958
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:51,678
microorganisms that maybe were once

959
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,120
thriving in there the majority of them

960
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,240
are dead by the time it even gets to

961
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:55,918
your place

962
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,240
so just something to consider when

963
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,320
composting if you're buying it off of

964
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,240
somebody else purchase it during the

965
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:04,720
winter time bring it back to your area

966
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,599
store it in a nice dark cool place i

967
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,679
like having my compost in um in a bin

968
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,159
with the lid on it one thing that i've

969
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,240
noticed just leaving my bag out in my

970
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,320
garden is it definitely attracts a lot

971
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,559
of gnats and flies

972
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,720
so for me i roll it up tightly put a

973
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:22,078
clip on it and then i put it in a bin

974
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,678
that's locked

975
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,159
if there is a time it's usually during

976
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,559
the summertime that these that more

977
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,039
little fungus flies or nats start coming

978
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:33,279
in and i notice them on my

979
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,279
compost i'll put up one of those yellow

980
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,440
sticky traps and just lay it directly on

981
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,280
my compost bag and then put the lid on

982
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,960
it and seal it for like two weeks and

983
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,280
don't even touch it every single one of

984
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,358
those flies comes out hits that sticky

985
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,440
trap and doesn't go anywhere after that

986
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:49,279
so that totally works to try to keep

987
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,960
that population down if you notice that

988
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,679
same thing like with your vermicompost

989
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,199
bin sometimes you open it and if one it

990
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,200
only takes one little fly to get in

991
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,679
there and mess things up for you i hate

992
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,239
it when it happens i have my um

993
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:03,039
vermicompost bin indoors i just started

994
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:04,159
that

995
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:06,239
um

996
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:08,078
it's just a plastic tote some holes

997
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:09,358
poked all around the top and all around

998
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,680
the bottom

999
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:14,078
i filled it up with uh well i had an old

1000
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:16,239
10 gallon pot that i was using so i just

1001
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,240
used that i put in a whole bunch of

1002
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:21,118
plant material to give it time to die

1003
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:23,519
out i added in a handful of bokashi to

1004
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,838
give it the plant material to break down

1005
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:28,559
and then some kitchen food scraps

1006
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:31,039
what else do worms also like um oatmeal

1007
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:34,400
cornmeal stuff like that added in like a

1008
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:38,400
little treat um half of an avocado

1009
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,200
uh preferably a slightly you know rotten

1010
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,280
uh

1011
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:43,679
when it's mushier they get in there

1012
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,000
quicker i've noticed if i put in a fresh

1013
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:48,078
avocado they're not going anywhere near

1014
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,320
it because uh maybe it's too hard for

1015
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,079
them to break it down

1016
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,320
but um if you want to speed up your worm

1017
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,119
population that's the easy way to do it

1018
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:00,559
one thing i uh vermicompost is really

1019
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,000
amazing but it is high in bacteria

1020
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:03,519
that's just something to consider

1021
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,800
depending on which types of plants

1022
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:09,358
you're growing because um

1023
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,920
annuals things like that usually like

1024
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:15,039
really high bacteria environment and

1025
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,760
soil to grow in and typically trees

1026
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:20,400
shrubs or your perennials

1027
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,960
usually like more of a fungi dominant

1028
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,960
soil to grow in so also it has a ratio

1029
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,199
of bacteria to fungi

1030
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,440
your annuals like more bacteria and your

1031
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:31,439
perennials like more fungi

1032
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,920
but vermicompost is really awesome it's

1033
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:37,039
got a lot of bacteria and the worm

1034
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,240
castings are coated with polysaccharides

1035
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:42,880
and carbohydrates and simple proteins so

1036
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:45,358
vermicompost is really rich in nutrients

1037
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,640
uh it can help retain moisture and it

1038
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,759
helps

1039
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:52,559
the soil like soil structure

1040
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,160
and conditioning of soil it too

1041
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:55,838
might be able to help get rid of some

1042
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:58,960
pathogens

1043
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:01,039
anytime anyone is mixing up new soil

1044
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,280
that they want to start a new garden in

1045
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:06,320
you should add vermicompost which is

1046
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:10,400
worm castings and regular compost

1047
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:12,720
like cow manure mix it in with um i

1048
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,800
always like native soil because of the

1049
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:17,759
sand silt and clay that's involved you

1050
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,640
need that for cation exchange

1051
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,599
and so i like mixing the compost in with

1052
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:25,519
that and then putting a topsoil on top

1053
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,280
and then waiting about two weeks and

1054
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:29,920
then putting your plants into that

1055
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,680
topsoil area when they're ready they'll

1056
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,000
go after that compost and they'll just

1057
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:35,039
be sitting there waiting for them

1058
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,039
um

1059
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:38,320
vermicompost is a really

1060
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,639
easy way

1061
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,960
to take care of um

1062
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:45,519
getting rid of kitchen scraps or stuff

1063
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,280
like that it's nice to use it for tea if

1064
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:50,719
you want to give it to your plants

1065
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,240
regular composting can take a bit longer

1066
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:53,838
there's hot composting and then there's

1067
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,559
cold composting

1068
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,519
hot composting um it's it's ready pretty

1069
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:59,759
quickly

1070
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:02,800
it gets really hot and it really cooks

1071
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,880
and you gotta you gotta turn it and mix

1072
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,480
it so that way what was in the center is

1073
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,039
now on the outside and what was on the

1074
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,838
outside is now in the center to even it

1075
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,800
out

1076
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:12,159
um

1077
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,880
anything about

1078
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,239
composting or the soil food web i would

1079
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,039
highly recommend

1080
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:21,598
checking out dr elaine ingham's videos

1081
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:23,920
she goes into so much detail that is her

1082
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,320
jam she loves talking about the soil

1083
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:31,599
food web and composting and even um

1084
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,720
lowensville the guy that wrote this book

1085
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,800
he uh took her course and got into um

1086
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,719
composting in the soil food web with her

1087
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,839
and highly recommends checking her out

1088
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:40,719
as well

1089
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:42,000
um

1090
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,598
i like doing

1091
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,400
cold composting it's what i'm doing

1092
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,760
myself or i call it the lazy compost

1093
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,480
that's where you're just kind of putting

1094
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,160
like a layer of browns in and a layer of

1095
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,400
greens and when you got

1096
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,319
kitchen scraps you put it on there if

1097
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,720
you've got um

1098
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,160
specific type of manures

1099
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:03,439
uh this year i have used uh aged horse

1100
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:05,920
manure

1101
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,400
along with and i layered it like a

1102
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:11,838
lasagna so browns include anything

1103
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,559
that's dead like dead leaves dead weeds

1104
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:16,000
um cardboard paper

1105
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:18,639
some things

1106
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,519
can be decomposed really quickly

1107
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:23,519
your trash that's mainly um

1108
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:25,440
paper material

1109
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:28,000
uh then you got your greens which

1110
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:32,000
basically means anything alive like

1111
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,559
plants that were alive um food food that

1112
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,760
you had ate in your kitchen scraps poop

1113
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:40,000
i guess that's considered a green

1114
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,119
greens offer more nitrogen

1115
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,519
and browns offer more carbon

1116
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,000
and so this is why i like to do a nice

1117
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:49,838
layer of both when i'm doing my cold

1118
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
composting because

1119
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:53,599
and i sprinkle a handful of bokashi on

1120
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,320
on it to get it you know rocking and

1121
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,240
rolling a little bit faster but uh i

1122
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,240
just sit there and and leave it be

1123
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:02,319
outside and i don't have to mess that i

1124
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,719
don't have to turn it too much

1125
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,200
i don't have to do anything but um wait

1126
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:09,919
for time and it'll just

1127
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:12,559
like break itself down to the point that

1128
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,119
you now have this really rich brown

1129
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:17,119
material that's kind of like most of

1130
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,960
it is unrecognizable you wouldn't have

1131
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,680
been able to tell really what went into

1132
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,400
it

1133
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:24,399
you could use that compost same way you

1134
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,039
could you could use vermicompost you

1135
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,440
could sprinkle it uh around your garden

1136
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:31,358
beds like put it on top

1137
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,240
as long as it's a few inches away from

1138
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:36,400
the stem of any of your plants

1139
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:38,879
or you can make a compost tea that's one

1140
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,119
of my favorite ways to do it because

1141
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,760
if you only have so much compost you

1142
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,559
really want it to spread and last a long

1143
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,920
time so using just a handfuls and making

1144
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:52,078
a tea out of it and you can apply it

1145
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,800
you could apply it often but i

1146
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,318
personally only do tea once a week

1147
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:01,280
and um even like with indoors on the

1148
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:04,000
beds that i have i'm slowly starting to

1149
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,119
back off of that because i've been doing

1150
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,880
compost teas for so long in these beds

1151
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,318
they're like good they don't need any

1152
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,280
more you don't need to keep on

1153
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:15,119
reapplying it but this is this is a bed

1154
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,040
there's so much to learn about growing

1155
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,519
in a bed versus growing outdoors in the

1156
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,199
ground where it's a lot easier in a bed

1157
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,039
you have this controlled environment

1158
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:24,480
once you put things in there it doesn't

1159
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:25,279
leave

1160
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,760
and

1161
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:32,880
whereas outdoors it could kind of

1162
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,119
you know go somewhere else and you know

1163
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,039
go to the next soil or somewhere else or

1164
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,680
deeper into the ground

1165
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:43,279
so you've got to be very careful not to

1166
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:45,759
add not to overdo it with the compost

1167
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:49,200
um a really light tea once a week is

1168
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,920
fine if you are reusing your soil

1169
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:53,199
watch out after doing it for

1170
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,440
so many

1171
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:58,000
runs or so many years

1172
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,079
um if you're doing it in a bed outdoors

1173
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,119
probably not that big of a deal

1174
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,039
but some people have applied top

1175
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,838
amendments and some people have watered

1176
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,599
with compost and after so many years

1177
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:11,199
their soil is just so enriched with

1178
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,680
microbial life that they don't need to

1179
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:17,118
do anything other than to keep it wet so

1180
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,879
that's where that magic happens

1181
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,640
where you've already done so much to

1182
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,400
your soil now it's totally hooked up and

1183
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:25,199
you don't need to do anything else to it

1184
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,599
other than just keep it moist

1185
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:30,480
compost is really awesome compost and

1186
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,440
vermicompost super simple easy ways to

1187
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,440
put nutrients and microbials back into

1188
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,358
your soil and let the microbials do all

1189
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,280
the work for you you don't need to do it

1190
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:40,880
when i started my vermicompost bin it's

1191
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,720
very similar to what what you explained

1192
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,480
right so you got the bin poke holes in

1193
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:46,719
the bottom i actually have a screen on

1194
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,559
the inside so things don't escape out

1195
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:50,078
those holes in the bottom holes around

1196
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:53,358
the top as well

1197
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,039
and then to start it i did a

1198
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:57,358
pretty standard a lot of people do this

1199
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,838
is the brick of cocoa

1200
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:02,480
mixed with some shredded paper or some

1201
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:04,559
people use shredded cardboard as well

1202
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,760
so mixing that all together

1203
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,960
adding in

1204
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,160
worms so buying worms from uncle jim's

1205
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,519
worm farm

1206
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:13,598
i bought the red wigglers and i bought

1207
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,199
the european nightcrawlers so

1208
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,359
diversity

1209
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:19,519
is what i was aiming for there um and

1210
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:22,318
then adding in your your inputs the

1211
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:24,159
greens and and brown so normally for

1212
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:25,599
greens what i'll add is

1213
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:27,440
i'll add in

1214
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,400
just any kind of leftover salad stuff

1215
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,960
that isn't eaten um anything real green

1216
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,680
vegetables uh goes in the bin

1217
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,358
um i also add in eggshells

1218
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:40,639
and i add in a lot of coffee grounds as

1219
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:42,000
well so those are kind of the main

1220
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:44,559
things that come to mind that i

1221
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,159
typically add in the bin and typically i

1222
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:47,920
do it on a weekly basis

1223
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:49,598
so i know a lot of people wondering

1224
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,200
frequency how often should you be adding

1225
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,559
stuff in there you can actually get to a

1226
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:55,279
point where you put too much in there

1227
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:58,480
right so like too much food for the

1228
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:01,280
worms it can go anaerobic it can have a

1229
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,599
lot of you know gnats flying around or

1230
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,440
pests flying around and so it can really

1231
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,039
turn into a bad environment if you

1232
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,119
aren't doing anything right doing things

1233
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,800
right which is something that that i

1234
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,519
quickly learned i had a nap problem for

1235
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,359
a while but um i ended up balancing

1236
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:16,960
things out i feel like and getting more

1237
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:19,039
aeration down there and the moisture

1238
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,119
level correct and all that stuff

1239
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,199
and now i feel like things are going

1240
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,440
pretty good there so but normally i'll

1241
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:27,919
add stuff in on a weekly basis

1242
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,639
and i'll kind of rotate around on the

1243
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,119
different sections of the bin right so

1244
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:34,960
like you know maybe the top right corner

1245
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,640
i'll do one week then the next week i'll

1246
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,480
go to the bottom or you know right

1247
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:40,318
corner and then i'll kind of rotate

1248
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,240
around by the time i get back down to

1249
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:44,800
that corner that i started in it's

1250
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:46,879
usually broken down at that point um and

1251
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,318
then i'm able to add in more in that

1252
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,519
area but i had it for about four months

1253
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:52,318
so far

1254
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:54,318
um

1255
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:56,480
and so i don't feel like i'm able to

1256
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:58,639
take things from that bin yet and use it

1257
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,599
for anything i think it takes uh longer

1258
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:01,199
than that

1259
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,960
um i know some people say they don't

1260
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,358
even start pulling stuff out of there

1261
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,519
until like a year into it so i'm not

1262
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:09,519
sure what your take on that is if it's

1263
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:11,039
like six months or a year or when you

1264
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:12,719
start using

1265
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,279
so much activity like you're saying this

1266
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:16,799
time of year it's a lot colder so they

1267
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,200
might not be working so fast because

1268
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,400
they're not moving a whole lot versus

1269
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:22,960
during the summer time when they're

1270
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,119
warmer they are working a lot faster so

1271
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,119
they are going through and and

1272
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,079
composting everything for you a lot

1273
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,960
quicker

1274
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,240
um

1275
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,400
the other trick i think we were talking

1276
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,559
about this last time we did our show was

1277
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,800
um instead of just you could just put

1278
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:38,400
your food scraps in there but instead of

1279
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,160
doing that you could also put them in a

1280
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,720
blender so that they're already broken

1281
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:43,759
down and extremely available to all the

1282
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:45,358
worms

1283
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,760
microbial life because it's not just

1284
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:49,598
worms that make up that worm then it's

1285
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,960
it's the fungi and the bacterium and

1286
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,440
other things breaking it down and then

1287
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,280
the worms come and eat that

1288
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,800
like i said with the avocado they the

1289
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:01,920
worms did not want to touch a nice fresh

1290
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,960
um hard avocado they wanted it to be

1291
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,559
partially starting to like turn brown

1292
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,119
a little bit rotten

1293
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:11,279
um they don't like citrus stuff i've

1294
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,440
heard they don't like the orange peels

1295
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,839
or lemon peels or anything like that

1296
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,880
they won't eat it or go near it

1297
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:18,799
um

1298
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,280
i always like throwing in apples and

1299
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:23,119
stuff like that um i like cornmeal it

1300
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,760
just it's funny i've watched so many

1301
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,920
videos on uh vermicomposting and there's

1302
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,920
this sweet english lady that loved her

1303
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,480
worm bin and would go on about all these

1304
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,318
treats she was giving her worms she goes

1305
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,880
i love to get new treats like the

1306
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:38,639
cornmeal

1307
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,318
and i think about that every time i go

1308
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:41,920
to open up my worm bin when it's time to

1309
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:44,800
give them a little food i'm like give me

1310
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,800
a little corn meal

1311
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,280
but it's fun like it's fun to make it um

1312
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:51,119
it does take a while until you can

1313
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,640
actually reap the rewards of the verma

1314
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,760
compost bin

1315
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:56,078
but um

1316
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,760
once you do have it going and you get it

1317
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,000
and you understand it and then you can

1318
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,240
kind of keep like maybe two bins like

1319
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
maybe this bin is ready to be harvested

1320
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:05,039
a little bit out of while this bin is

1321
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,440
working

1322
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:09,079
you know and that's just a super super

1323
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,599
easy way to put more

1324
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:13,920
micronutrients and microbial life back

1325
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,680
into your soil that's readily available

1326
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,599
to your plants

1327
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:20,399
absolutely it's a step towards closed

1328
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,240
loop operation so for sure and then the

1329
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,639
same thing with the outdoor composting

1330
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:27,039
in the cold compost pile worms will make

1331
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:29,598
their way up there so that outdoor

1332
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:32,400
compost pile also has worm doodoos in it

1333
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,640
also so you are totally good to use that

1334
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,119
you don't if you're outdoors you don't

1335
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:39,598
need both the outdoor pile and a warm

1336
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,480
bin i use my worm bed for the indoor

1337
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,079
stuff

1338
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:47,119
bokashi is like also fermented organic

1339
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:49,920
matter it's extremely extremely easy

1340
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,880
it's it's it's a lot like the whole imo

1341
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,880
process

1342
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,920
except for with bokashi

1343
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,280
um they use it they buy that bottle of

1344
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,280
em1

1345
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,920
from terragenix

1346
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,599
and they take that

1347
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,119
they put it in a big old five gallon

1348
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,760
bucket of water with a little bit of

1349
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:10,559
molasses and stir it up real nicely then

1350
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,960
they use that water to soak

1351
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:15,760
malted bran

1352
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,318
or malted barley sorry they use that

1353
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,359
water to soak malted barley

1354
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:23,679
and then um you let that sit and firm it

1355
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:25,440
in a plastic baggie for like two weeks

1356
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:27,279
and then after that you take it out and

1357
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,358
then you let it dry out

1358
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,760
it takes a few days and you turn it so

1359
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:33,279
often but once it's completely dry you

1360
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,680
now have like

1361
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,079
bokashi that could be put in a bag or a

1362
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:40,399
shelf stable you could buy bokashi this

1363
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,000
is from kashi blend

1364
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,318
and uh let me show you what it looks

1365
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,838
like on the inside bokashi is another

1366
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:49,358
really amazing great tool that you could

1367
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:51,199
use the same way as like other

1368
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:53,199
composting you could

1369
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,960
put it on top of your

1370
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:56,960
soil you could put it right next to your

1371
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,119
plants it'll help

1372
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,679
it'll help increase the microbial

1373
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,519
population it'll help with fungi it'll

1374
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:06,399
help with the bacteria

1375
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:10,079
um it puts a lot of nutrients

1376
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:12,559
and enzymes and whatnot back into

1377
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,400
your soil see this is what bokashi looks

1378
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,960
like

1379
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,680
okay yeah i use grow kashi which is a

1380
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,880
brand of it i believe um

1381
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:24,799
yeah

1382
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:27,358
by uh this one's by growing organic

1383
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,030
so this one has the rice bran

1384
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:29,358
uh

1385
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:31,359
[Music]

1386
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:34,480
a lot of other wheat bran and insect

1387
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:38,558
frass molasses and then the em but they

1388
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:41,920
put other stuff in here like um biochar

1389
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:44,720
and uh high nitrogen amino acids so with

1390
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,318
the with the compost and the bokashi

1391
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:48,480
once you have enough you don't need to

1392
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:50,639
keep reapplying it and so it's just

1393
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,400
something to look you you don't need to

1394
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:53,440
do too much just a little bit is good

1395
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,200
enough

1396
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,639
and i love personally love using this

1397
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:59,039
book flashy if you've seen a lot of

1398
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:01,679
people showing off their soils and you

1399
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:03,679
see the little uh fungi little mycelium

1400
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:05,519
growing and they say man ever since i

1401
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:07,039
put that bokashi down that's exactly

1402
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:09,519
what they're talking about

1403
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:12,159
you can make a compost tea

1404
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:14,880
this is um this is a recipe that i

1405
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:17,118
wanted to give your viewers

1406
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,280
with the compost tea

1407
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:22,400
you basically get um

1408
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:25,680
and you can buy compost or worm castings

1409
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,358
from your local grow store or online um

1410
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:30,078
just be careful about it not being out

1411
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:31,440
in the sun and or direct sunlight or

1412
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,359
getting too hot

1413
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:37,679
but this recipe is really awesome you

1414
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:40,480
get um one cup of oli mountain compost

1415
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:44,078
a half a cup of worm castings

1416
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:46,880
you get a handful of bokashi

1417
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:50,960
you mix all that together along with

1418
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,920
two tablespoons of oatmeal flour

1419
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,679
and

1420
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:57,440
one tablespoon of rock phosphate

1421
00:50:55,679 --> 00:51:00,558
and

1422
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:03,760
oh yeah two tablespoons of barley but i

1423
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:06,079
use gnarly barley from clackamas coop

1424
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,000
and you mix all that together you get a

1425
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,760
little bit wet i put this up on my

1426
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,599
instagram page today just to show

1427
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,680
everybody the recipe and how to make it

1428
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:16,160
i make it all the time you mix it

1429
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:18,239
together you get a little bit moist then

1430
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:20,399
you put it in a container with a cover

1431
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:21,598
on but not all the way on just slightly

1432
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,639
on top

1433
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,400
and

1434
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:27,199
you wait for about three days it's got

1435
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,519
to be in a warm but dark location so

1436
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:31,759
that the fungi on it can grow

1437
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:33,440
so i made this three days ago so i could

1438
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,599
show you guys

1439
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,200
usually if you're storing this i i leave

1440
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,960
the lid like that

1441
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:42,078
so that way a little bit of air could

1442
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:44,000
get in the lid's not completely sealed

1443
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,200
and this is what happens three days

1444
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,838
later

1445
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:49,598
oh okay you see this nice museum when

1446
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:51,599
you go out to the forest and you're

1447
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,240
trying to get a collection

1448
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:56,480
of um indigenous microorganisms this is

1449
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:58,479
what you're looking for

1450
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,960
you could make it yourself it's not the

1451
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,440
same i personally prefer just

1452
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,199
all sorts of a variety a diverse variety

1453
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,679
of different things

1454
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:09,519
but this see how like nice and soft this

1455
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:10,879
is it kind of smells like apple cider

1456
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:13,679
vinegar

1457
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,160
i call it uh santa's beard

1458
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:18,318
also in that um teaming with microbes

1459
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:20,480
book he shows you uh how you can make

1460
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:22,400
this this recipe i got off my friend

1461
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,039
random nicole 420

1462
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:29,519
so it's kind of like a cake

1463
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:29,519
and what i would do um when it's time

1464
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:36,239
see that oh okay breaking it right open

1465
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,240
there yeah wow

1466
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:43,119
when it's time i put this in a in a tea

1467
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:44,799
bag and i make a tea out of this

1468
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:48,000
this will create a

1469
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:51,359
fungi rich compost and this is good for

1470
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,440
plants that love fungi

1471
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:56,960
you could feed this tea to any of your

1472
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,960
plants because fungi life lasts for so

1473
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:03,039
long as long as you maintain

1474
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,800
maintain it that's so funny

1475
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:06,318
that's so cool

1476
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,800
i'm definitely gonna have to take that

1477
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:10,558
recipe and try it out i will send it to

1478
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,880
you but i'm telling you it's the coolest

1479
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:15,119
thing ever if you could if you make this

1480
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,039
and i've tried a few different ways to

1481
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,680
get it right you know

1482
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:21,199
just cold and dark

1483
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:23,519
i mean i wouldn't eat this but it does

1484
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:25,679
smell really good it reminds me of like

1485
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:28,000
fruit or apple cider vinegar as long as

1486
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:29,759
it smells good it's good to work with if

1487
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,679
if it starts smelling really nasty or

1488
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,599
funky then it's no good

1489
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:35,598
and nice thing about bokashi one of the

1490
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,519
things that it does is it helps to get

1491
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,359
rid of all that smell

1492
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:41,358
funky smells of anything and it helps

1493
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:44,000
them to break down faster

1494
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:47,279
this has created a lot of

1495
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,599
fungi life a lot of bacteria

1496
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,280
there's a lot of great things in here

1497
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,119
that i could use

1498
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,440
and put in my um

1499
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:58,480
my tea and then this tea i give to my

1500
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,639
plants about once a week until i notice

1501
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,480
that my plants have had too much by

1502
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:04,318
checking out their leaves then i start

1503
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,800
backing off that's all so i wanted to

1504

1511
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:23,199
out that's uh that's really cool i love

1512
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,200
how there's so many different ways to to

1513
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:25,919
go about you know feeding these plants

1514
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:27,919
or

1515
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,200
you know providing care for these plants

1516
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,800
it's uh

1517
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,838
you know we talked about so many things

1518
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,200
that are like

1519
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:37,920
your non-traditional way of growing yeah

1520
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:41,039
and it just it opens up your mind and it

1521
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:43,680
uh it makes things fun it really does

1522
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:45,679
so it does seem traditional but that's

1523
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:48,239
the funny thing isn't it

1524
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:50,318
it is very traditional why did we switch

1525
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:52,159
from our traditional simple ways of

1526
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:54,880
farming to go to this new thing that

1527
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:57,358
said we had to go out and buy nutrients

1528
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,960
from bottles i could go into details but

1529
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:00,719
i'm not gonna it's just it's

1530
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,798
