2
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,039
know me my name is chris aka mr growit

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,039
and today i've got an unboxing video for

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:16,799
you look what we have

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:20,559
here brand new not even released yet ec

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,240
infinity cloud ray s6 clip-on fan

7
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,879
developer edition i'm so excited for

8
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:27,358
this one i actually had the idea for a

9
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:30,079
clip-on fan that connects to the grow 10

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,679
clips onto the grow 10 back in 2016 a

11
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,320
few years later there was a company that

12
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,839
released one however the quality wasn't

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,558
really that great a lot of people

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,160
reported problems and of the few i had

15
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:41,679
one of them died out which the company

16
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,640
replaced and then another one that

17
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,000
became extremely noisy over time so not

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,679
really the best quality but this one

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,200
right here ac infinity is known for

20
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,198
their quality they're certainly changing

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
the game with this one ac infinity

22
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,320
actually sent me over this one and they

23
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,439
hooked up my viewers with a discount

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,960
code you can use code mr growit for 15

25
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,679
off on their website and if you're on

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,478
amazon you can use code mr grow at 15 to

27
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,560
get you 15 off okay now let's unbox this

28
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,118
thing

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,200
all right so nice looking box i have

30
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:15,680
here you can see on the side adjustable

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:18,070
tilt digital 10 speed ip44 temperature

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,840
and humidity proof

33
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:22,399
[Music]

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,640
on the side here it says ec motor runs

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,960
quieter more energy efficient and has a

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,519
longer life span than ac motors it's

37
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,438
ip44 rated components are sealed to be

38
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,078
highly resistant to heat liquids and

39
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:37,039
dust digital control pwm technology

40
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:39,758
enables a wider range of 10 fan speeds

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,320
and uis compatible connects to uis

42
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,280
controllers for temperature humidity

43
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:48,000
cycle and schedule programs

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,920
first thing out the box is a user manual

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,879
in the user manuals you'll find some key

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,118
features

47
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:57,438
installation instructions programming

48
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,438
instructions and warranty information

49
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,839
here is the circulation fan color is

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,320
black

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,560
pretty sleek very lightweight you can

52
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,478
see the buttons on the back

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,920
one is for the different fan speeds and

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,400
the other one is for the oscillation

55
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,919
feature there's a power cord it's pretty

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,000
long i believe it's nine feet long

57
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,318
here is the grip clip so you'll attach

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,400
the circulation fan to the grip clip and

59
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,238
then you'll be able to clip this onto

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,520
the pole of your grow tent

61
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,039
in this bag right here there's a few

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,680
different things an extension cord

63
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,199
there's an adapter dongle

64
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,840
a cable tie

65
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,839
and a cable mount

66
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,000
it's actually pretty easy to put

67
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,599
together all you have to do is unscrew

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,639
this piece that's on the grip clip

69
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,719
you'll slide in the circulating fan

70
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,199
slide that piece back through and screw

71
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:54,239
it together

72
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,238
and then it's good to go

73
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,280
okay so in my two foot by four foot grow

74
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,239
tent this one's actually by ac infinity

75
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,479
as well

76
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,480
clipped it onto the side of the tent and

77
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,318
pressing the button to turn it on

78
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,479
you can see there lights up on the

79
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:11,039
different speeds so i pressed it six

80
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,639
times it's on speed six out of ten if i

81
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,959
pressed it eleventh time it would turn

82
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,359
the fan off there's a spot there for the

83
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,039
uis and then the button there for

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,080
oscillation feature

85
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,560
super quiet fan i was really shocked by

86
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,319
how quiet this fan actually is

87
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,878
stays close to the grow tent doesn't

88
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,280
take up much space and yeah i can't say

89
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:33,199
enough about this this is very high

90
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,799
quality i will leave a link to ac

91
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,878
