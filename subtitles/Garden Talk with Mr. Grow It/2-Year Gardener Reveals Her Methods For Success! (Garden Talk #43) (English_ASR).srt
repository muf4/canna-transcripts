that and then i also started growing it

144
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,038

we're doing this and

169
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:06,399
once i started i realized that um

170
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:07,918
growing things is more complicated than

171
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,679
just throwing it in the dirt and putting

172
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,159
some water unless you're going alone

173
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,680
then that's something different but

174
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,199
um

175
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,639
i realized it was more to it and then

176
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,160
i just started reading more like i'm

177
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,160
like anyone else i don't like to not

178
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,680
know something i don't like to be in a

179
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,199
room with someone mentioned something

180
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,519
and like for example everybody was

181
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,840
talking about vpd around a lot when i

182
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:32,159
didn't know what that was we googling we

183
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,599
read and i want to know so

184
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,439
same thing with you know beginning

185
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,439
growing eyes same thing i couldn't

186
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,719
figure out why certain things happened

187
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,519
to my dirt

188
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,960
school i got racist so

189
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:44,318
um

190
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,680
i couldn't figure out what was happening

191
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,879
to my dirt so i researched that i

192
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,639
couldn't figure out what my legs were

193
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,719
looking my head's looking crazy so i

194
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,800
researched it um

195
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,639
and then as time was going along i

196
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,520
started learning about different things

197
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,038
as i'm

198
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,680
googling and researching i'm coming

199
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:04,560
across people like you um the guys

200
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,639
already see on media um goblin uh

201
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,879
doggo vader like i'm coming across all

202
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,519
these people and i realized this is a

203
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,439
thing like this is like really big

204
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:17,120
um so then

205
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:19,120
i just started watching and you know go

206
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,959
down like the blue pull of the red pill

207
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,478
blue for the rip and which one you take

208
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:25,519
so i think i took a half of each you

209
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,399
know um it was like we're doing this so

210
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,399
um

211
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,359
fast forward to two years later and now

212

230

i do awesome and now you've gotten to

231
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,680
the point where

232
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,319
you've got a youtube channel and you're

233
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,079
showcasing not only your grow i've seen

234
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,199
you grow on your youtube channel but you

235
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,240
also have

236
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,598
kind of

237
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,240
a shows i guess you can call it canisius

238
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,360

239
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,478

240
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,479
your youtube channel and kind of what

241
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,318
you got going on there yo here it was

242
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,478
chris watching my show y'all he watching

243
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,479
me

244
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,240
no um

245
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:38,478
so yes um so as i was researching um and

246
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,038
much to love you guys i do it was two

247
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,879
things i realized in the industry one

248
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,158
and nobody looked like me so when i

249
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:45,200
researched i couldn't find anybody that

250
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,838
looked like me

251
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,120
um that's a that's a problem for me

252
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,360
um

253
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,959
like even when people ask me how do i

254
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,000
pick out my lights

255
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:58,719
um one i have one of the sets of lights

256
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,639
i have is photon type lights

257
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,120
and how i picked those lights out was

258
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:06,639
because it was a young lady doing a

259
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,639
demonstration on the video

260
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,559
that's how i picked up like it was

261
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,240
basically i researched i got all the

262
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,518
specs information from like sitting in

263
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,399
different rooms talking to different

264
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,759
people

265
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,759
and then when i went to each company

266
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,439
each company had a guy you know doing

267
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,039
their whole demonstration and phone

268
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,519
contact had a female

269
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:28,399
and she broke it down and it made

270
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,679
perfect sense and i was relatable to me

271
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,360
and i thought that was dope and um i

272
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,879
realized that it's not a lot of females

273
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,560
in this space

274
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,919
so because of that i'll be like this is

275
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,439
crazy like how is it not that many

276
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,278
females in this space and we're the most

277
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,600
nurturing people on the planet like this

278
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,480
is for us we nurture this is what we do

279
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,240
um

280
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,800
so and then like i said there was no

281
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,480
people that looked like me so i

282
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,759
decided one day i'm gonna make a youtube

283
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,240
channel

284
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,319
i don't know how i started it but i did

285
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,480
and um it hadn't worked out i reached

286
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,480
out to people they started i'm saying

287
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,079
sure i'll do it sure i don't girl power

288
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,879
you know it's the year the girl paul

289
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:07,919
girl popper i got it so i realized that

290
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,958
i wanted to bring like two females in um

291
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,479
certain businesses and um

292
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,359
and just tell the story whatever the

293
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,959
story is and then when you fast tour i

294
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,360
realized that i wasn't talking to no

295
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,359
guys like i was leaving the guys out

296
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,200
yeah i mean and

297
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,600
when you do what they call what the

298
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,360
algorithm or the data i realized that

299
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,240
most of the people that watch me were

300
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,639
men

301
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,799
and it was just like oh snap like i

302
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,799
forgot all about the guys so i keep

303
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,559
forgetting that as beginner guys are

304
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,319
beginner growers are still because and

305
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,838
you know and the gardener fell it seemed

306
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,399
like it was just men growing so i ain't

307
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,320
never put pictures in my head that would

308
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,480
you know be getting rewards

309
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,200
and i realized that i i was little men

310
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,519
out so then i was like you know what

311
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,560
let me try you know doing a separate

312
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,839
show where i can um talk to my big bros

313
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,278
and then

314
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,600
i didn't want to just talk to you about

315
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,120

316
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,040

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,560
that like i want people to get to know

318
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,360

335
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,560

337
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,078
of them like to say women are not in the

338
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,839
military but most people most men are in

339
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,319
the military no one's really talking

340
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,839

i'll definitely link that video in the

382
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,000
description section below for those

383
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,560
watching on youtube if you want to check

384
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,639
out that video on her channel let's dive

385
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:19,759
into the grow side of things now so you

386
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,000
kind of already talked a little bit

387
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,919
about your growth style organics

388
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,639
but can you tell us you know are you an

389
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:29,439
indoor grower outdoor are you in soil

390
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,680
cocoa you were synthetic and now you're

391
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,560
organic so what's your kind of overall

392
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:38,159
ghost so when i first started it was um

393
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,719
organics

394
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,399
um it was nectar of the gods

395
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,120
i was so bored i was looking for the

396
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,879
gods um so imagine that i'm not gonna

397
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,879
gossip with bad story from

398
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,480
um

399
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,198
and

400
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,320
it got pricey over time so

401
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:02,159
i switched over from bags from bottles

402
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,399
because i went from so let me go back

403
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,879
i'm sorry so excellent with the vinyl

404
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,278
soils of nectar or the guys it starts

405
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,439
off with a baseline of four bottles

406
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:13,278
so for me because i was new it seems

407
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,760
simple when you walk into the stores and

408
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,039
you purchase it they give you a chart

409
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,919
they give you a chart it's like

410
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:22,399
self-explanatory and they give you how

411
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,399
much to put in per gallon all kinds of

412
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,958
stuff and then they have levels to it

413
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,240
where they have the basics advanced and

414
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,879
they have pro

415
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,720
now the reason why i like i like nectar

416
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,958
guys because now past tense i still like

417
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,759
them i just don't currently use them um

418
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,759
it's a plug-and-play system so

419
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,600
if you're into like science or you're

420
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,078
into wanting to see what your plants can

421
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,519
do or any kind of growth style with your

422
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,039
vegetables anything you want to see what

423
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,720
they're doing just trying to play with

424
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,360
it first to understand your to

425
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,360
understand the plant um for me nectar

426
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,839
guys was good because

427
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,480
um it allowed me to take each bottle to

428
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,920
see exactly what that bottle does it's

429
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,240
easy chris for me to watch you and you'd

430
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,958
be like yeah well you use bloom and make

431
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,039
sure your your peppers grow extra big

432
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,719
and that sounds good but how big how do

433
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,120
i know how big pepper supposed to get in

434
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,440
first place you know what i mean so i

435
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,759
would grow a pepper out and just see

436
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,600
what it would look like and um and then

437
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,838
the next one i would use the balloon i

438
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,440
would just plug the room in plug it in

439
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,800
and i wanted it it would show me what

440
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,279
the pepper would do and i'm like oh this

441
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,278
is cool or i'll be like oh like what it

442
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,919
does i'm not using it in my next next

443
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:32,958
cycle um so it has a plug-and-play

444
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:35,519
system um it also allows you in my

445
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,679
opinion to research whatever that's your

446
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,679
any item that you're growing and know

447
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,120
the particular information about that

448
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,758
plant and then figure out what stuff you

449
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,959
want to use for your plant um what will

450
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,680
work better so i like that however once

451
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:52,559
you dive into that that

452
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:55,439
philosophy you get to 18 bottles

453
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:58,799
and now was like becomes you know a lot

454
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,560
um so for me that was it is too too much

455
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,559
i want simple

456
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,958
i want um

457
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,638
the best but i want to be simple i have

458
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:09,919
a lot of tasks that i do throughout the

459
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,079
day i don't have time for 18 models so

460
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:14,000
i um started researching

461
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:16,638
about um

462
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,559
nutrients so i came across um dry

463
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,278
amendments um

464
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,559
and it's dr earth is what i use dr earth

465
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:23,919
now the dopest part about that you could

466
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,399
cut the boxes up and put it right in

467
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,559
your dirt so that's cool um so i have

468
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,320
that and then

469
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,078
i my next thing after that i researched

470
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,680
soil and then

471
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,359
once i started researching soil i

472
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,638
realized i could buy different bags of

473
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,278
soil or i can build my soil so i learned

474
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,320
to build my soil so my my i built my own

475
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:43,838
soil

476
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,839
um

477
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,530
i use pro mix

478
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,720
i use um

479
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:52,480
[Music]

480
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,680
worm castings i use uh

481
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,399
lake

482
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,479
water is called just water lakes

483
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,519
it's pretty expensive but it's great

484
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,440
because

485
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,519
it just uses up the water has all like

486
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,279
slight already slight amendments in it

487
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,120
so it you can use it and mix it with

488
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,519
your pro mix and make your pro mix

489
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,479
stretch longer um

490
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,959
and then

491
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,519
i use some other stuff that i get from

492
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,199
other places like maybe if i decide like

493
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,480
this cycle i'm going to go and build a

494
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,240
they have you know amendments that you

495
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,759
could put in to reinvent your soil so

496
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,720
this cycle i'm deciding to go to better

497
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,599
soil

498
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,439

624
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,558
so dope but yeah you named off a bunch

625
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,480
of good lights that's really cool that

626
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:23,359
you've actually gone to the point now

627
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,038
where

628
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:26,479
you know you mentioned you started off

629
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:27,919
small and kind of worked your way up

630
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,440
into some of these things you didn't

631
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,520
start out with

632
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,600
hld 600 right you had lights before and

633
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,918
all that stuff so it was a gradual

634
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,558
transition right i didn't know i used a

635
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,000
little 50 hour lights from um amazon

636
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:41,279
like they our pools we call them blurb

637
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,679
rules you know they use a little purple

638
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,200
so yes i did not start off that way i

639
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,200
started off with those and i just

640
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,319
transitioned as the research as i

641
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,519
started researching so yeah awesome so

642
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,918
are you

643
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,480
typically starting from seed or do you

644
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:59,200
do clones or what i do both

645
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,880
um i typically i don't use no one else's

646
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,159
clones uh you will never see me bring

647
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,880
anyone's clones from outside um in my

648
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,559
into my girl never i would never do that

649
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,320
i'm not against it if that's what you

650
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:11,359
choose to do but for me

651
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,038
um

652
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:16,479
all the horror stories is good enough

653
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:18,240
for me to learn from um i don't know how

654
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,599
other people cater to these plans i

655
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,038
don't know what they started defeating

656
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:22,959
them i don't know

657
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,440
what they did to get the clone i don't

658
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,440
know how they cloned so i choose not to

659
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,440
go with clones but i do use clones

660
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,759
because i clone my own plants

661
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,279
so i'm about saving money if you watch

662
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:34,879
me you know that i'm about to save money

663
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:37,119
do it yourself and

664
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,559
um clone saves you money especially on

665
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,959
genetics that you like

666
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,639
um i typically you see it's funny

667
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,720
because um

668
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,559
i got into cloning because

669
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,798
out of everything and growing i want

670
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,319
those people to been lucky to not have

671
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:51,839
no problems with growing like i haven't

672
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,158
had that issue where people start to

673
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,359
have issues and blood right and

674
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,520
i haven't had any of those like i

675
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,639
haven't had like um bugs or any type of

676
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,639
those things

677
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,880
um

678
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,759
the biggest issue i have in growing my

679
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,240
biggest downfall is germination

680
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:10,640
i have a problem i do not know why i've

681
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,880
killed so many seeds but my biggest

682
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,759
problem has always been germination so

683
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,200
um

684
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:17,038
yeah i start from seed because i'm going

685
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,319
to get nail pack i don't care

686
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:22,240
um but yeah so season then i clone

687
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,480
because i need to save time i wanna save

688
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,558
time and i know that because i have uh

689
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,599
germination issues that you better call

690
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:30,158
them because you're not going you may

691
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,599
not get nothing

692
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,520
well oftentimes a lot of people don't

693
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:34,879
know this i mean one reason why i

694
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,400
struggle sometimes when it comes to

695
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,799
germination is the

696
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,159
temperature of the medium right if it's

697
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:41,119
too low like you're in a basement you

698
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,880
mentioned

699
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:45,038
maybe the temperature is just too low

700
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,559
and it's not able to kind of sprout from

701
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:48,558
the medium just because

702
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,480
the medium's not in the the proper range

703
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:52,960
i struggle with that myself a little bit

704
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,720
i need to be extra careful that my

705
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,558
medium is in the proper temperature i

706
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,400
think a lot of people overlook that okay

707
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,158
and they don't even really think of that

708
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,240
so you might want to look into that now

709
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,240
when i looked at your channel i saw you

710
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,159
have you know you mentioned diy you

711
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,319
actually created your own aeroponic

712
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,480
setup for cloning can you talk to us

713
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:11,918
like how you built that

714
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,079
okay so

715
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,840
don't think the machines cost a lot of

716
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:20,319
money like they cost a lot of money

717
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:22,480
and i just was not paying it i just felt

718
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,519
like this doesn't make any sense this is

719
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,640
weird

720
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:28,000
so

721
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,759
um i go on youtube and i'm researching

722
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,679
like all these things and i was teaching

723
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,919
you how to make these miniature versions

724
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,000
of it right but the one that i wanted

725
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,400
cost a hundred and like ninety dollars

726
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,319
right so i wanted to make recreate that

727
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,640
one so i went online and um i think i

728
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:46,720
came across goblin or something and he

729
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,200
was doing it and then uh doggo was doing

730
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,519
a couple were doing different things so

731
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,679
i just took some notes and i decided to

732
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:56,240
do my own version of it and a really

733
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,919
bigger version of it so because i wanted

734
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,720
like i said i wanted more

735
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,440
so

736
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,159
i i went to home depot and i got um

737
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,240
seven gallon i know i'm sorry fourteen

738
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,720
dollar seven gallon and fourteen gallon

739
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,240
um just regular tubs the ones you would

740
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,000
you know store your christmas lights in

741
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,720
or the ones you would send to college

742
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,919
with your kids or something i got those

743
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,159
um

744
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,320
i got me

745
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,600
i want to say correctly

746
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:24,319
a saw

747
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:27,278
bit which is i call it the circle part i

748
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:28,960
call it a circle whereas i saw a bit um

749
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:29,759
it was like six bucks

750
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,960
i

751
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:35,679
the the tubs were like 11

752
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,798
um and then i had a coupon too so i was

753
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,559
couponing um

754
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:43,839
what else uh

755
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:45,359
then i went to my local hydroponic store

756
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,439
and i'm like

757
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,000
i was like oh this says air for water

758
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,080
this should work i brought two of those

759
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,278
um and they were like uh i had some

760
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,519
points because i shop at the local

761
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,798
hydroponics door a lot so those were

762
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,200
free for me what's happening there would

763
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:00,720
have been like 14 a piece or something

764
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,759
but they were afraid because i had

765
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,679
points

766
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,599
um

767
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,840
and then i proceeded to go home thinking

768
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,119
that was it

769
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:10,079
and

770
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,558
um

771
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:15,038
i forgot to to be i didn't realize that

772
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,798
i needed a certain kind of tubing so

773
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:19,599
then i had to go back to that a little

774
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:22,398
walmart got the tv and then and the

775
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:25,038
tubing is from my for a fish tank it's

776
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:26,959
basically for a fish tank um that cleans

777
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:27,679
you know cleanses this to tank out for

778
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,000
you

779
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:33,919
and then i needed some

780
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,079
air air stones got those from walmart

781
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,440
for a fish tank four dollars

782
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:40,240
um

783
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,360
and i got all these feelings together

784
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,558
and

785
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,079
i didn't know what i was doing like i

786
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:45,359
was just like well jay what are you

787
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,319
doing like like you just have all these

788
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,639
pieces

789
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:50,639
and then i sat down and just mapped it

790
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,399
out i was like okay so we're gonna put i

791
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,720
just turned to turn to the rounds like

792
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:57,278
each square is gonna be a hole right so

793
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,200
i'm putting the holes in i'm like dope

794
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:00,720
so then i'm like well how does the clone

795
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,960
i forgot to get the clone things i had

796
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,798
to go back to the hydroplant store and

797
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,798
get the hockey pucks i call them hockey

798
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,639
pucks you guys might call them something

799
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,240
else once again it's organics we call

800
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,399
them hockey pucks because

801
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,319
that's what i remember about so

802
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,558
um and they're pink

803
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:19,359
favorite color um

804
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:21,839
so i got hockey pucks and i made sure

805
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:24,158
the hockey pucks and the the circle

806
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:27,038
drill piece fit together and it did and

807
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,960
i just proceeded to just drill the holes

808
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,960
and then i realized okay at first my

809
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,519
first go around out i felt the water up

810
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,440
too high right so i'm like this doesn't

811
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,639
work like what's going on i'm doing

812
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,759
something wrong

813
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:43,278
and i realized i didn't build it wrong

814
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:46,319
i just was putting too much water

815
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:49,440
in the um in the container so then i had

816
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,519
the research on how to clone properly

817
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,278
which now turns into deep water culture

818
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,519
which i really kind of didn't even put

819
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:59,200
to the two together like oh i'm doing

820
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:00,480
deep water hydroponics here i come so

821
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,159
um

822
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,919
i realized i was putting too much water

823
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,320
basically i want the bubbles to you want

824
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,759
the bubbles to pretty much bubble up hit

825
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:10,558
the bottom of the arm

826
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:13,038
of the stems enough to you know moisten

827
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,798
it and make the roots stretch

828
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:17,038
um and then i put some

829
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,558
great white shark in the water stir it

830
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,319
up and

831
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:21,759
about the difference between my dual

832
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:23,038
just out cloning and the ones that you

833
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,919
purchase it might take a little bit

834
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:25,038
longer

835
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,120
um

836
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,200
it takes about 14 days total and get

837
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,278
really beefy in my clothing get really

838
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,440
bc ones now the dope thing about this

839
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,759
people is you don't have to buy a cloner

840
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,240
you don't have to make one because if

841
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,679
you just use water in a cup and change

842
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,558
out the water every single day you'll

843
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,480
get the same results um it's just that

844
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:46,960
it's a cup and you can put one or two um

845
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,480
you know plants in a cup um with the do

846
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,960
it with the cloners you can have

847
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,480
multiples and it kind of like helps

848
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,558
irrigate a little bit better so this way

849
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,640
you don't have to change the water every

850
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,639
day and for me i like to save money in

851
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,320
the same time and i'm gonna forget that

852
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,799
i gotta change the water and now we got

853
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:04,319
other problems so for me

854
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,398
the cloning machine was great because i

855
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:09,278
have to change the water but you can

856
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:11,359
clone without a clone or do itself i'm

857
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,278
glad you brought up that cup of water

858
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,839
and just sticking in there i did that

859
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:17,919
recently and i got nervous because the

860
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,439
clones started showing like deficiencies

861
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,000
and i wasn't changing out the water

862
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,159
every day because i was told that you

863
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
should like people do but you don't have

864
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,799
to like you can keep the same water for

865
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,038
like 14 days and then it will remove but

866
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,440
it was starting to struggle

867
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:34,798
i changed my for me i changed every day

868
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,880
i just changed a cup of water every

869
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:40,398
single day i make sure that my stem was

870
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,559
cut on the angle you know um every day i

871
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:44,079
just made sure i pieced the water and i

872
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:45,918
just had a bucket of water that already

873
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:47,599
pieced or whatever and

874
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,360
and i'll make sure it was a lid and

875
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:51,199
stuff on it and then every day i would

876
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:53,519
just change the water out change the

877
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,120
water out um i left the cups inside the

878
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,480
tents underneath the same cycle of

879
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,918
lights or whatever um as a veg and

880
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,960
i didn't have any

881
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,799
for me and my experience um changing the

882
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,720
water every day was very important

883
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,558
because when i did and it didn't the

884
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,798
roots didn't sprout or they died or

885
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:13,038
whatever occasionally so for me changing

886
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:14,639
the water every day just worked

887
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,720
so i'm going to change out the water

888
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,200
every day next time but a big difference

889
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,000
between the cup of water versus the

890
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,840
aeroponic method that you built the diy

891
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,519
aeroponic setup you're going to get much

892
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,000
fat you must be getting much faster

893
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,640
roots with the aeroponic setup right

894
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,319
because of the aeration you've also got

895
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,320
like you said i think you sp sprinkle

896
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:37,278
gray white in there right so you must be

897
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:39,759
getting roots as early as five days

898
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:43,599
roughly maybe seven days max is that

899
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:45,278
right in between seven to i one i saw

900
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:46,398
people just want to say stop 14 days

901
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,440
right thing because i want to buy like

902
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:50,879
oh my gosh she said no so i say 14 days

903
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,600
but for me

904
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,919
um if you go like you said like five to

905
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:58,158
seven days and if you see the video of

906
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,320
the cloning machine i did that was

907
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,880
a week later i think it was maybe like

908
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,038
so and they're like

909
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,799
they're coming out like they are like

910
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:08,640
crazy like you gotta put them in the

911
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,398
dirt quick because like they're beasting

912
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,440
really good and they're strong rules and

913
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:15,439
are beautiful to look at so um yeah

914
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,759
about five to seven days they're pretty

915
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,120
good um but i say fourteen just in case

916
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:20,960
you do something wrong or didn't use

917
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:22,879
great white or getting your water not ph

918
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,798
store there's other things in that that

919
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,039
can contribute to why your roots are not

920
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:28,720
coming if you got too much water maybe

921
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:30,000
you didn't pitch the water or maybe

922
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,079
something fell in your water or maybe

923
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,079
you didn't i'm sanitize your bucket

924
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:36,079
enough um because you got to realize

925
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,240
that is do it yourself so you don't want

926
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,759
none of the particles that you solved in

927
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,359
or none of those things in your water

928
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:43,919
gotta scrub that water out let me scrub

929
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,278
that bucket out so um

930
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,720
yeah so you want to make sure now i was

931
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:48,558
in it because that can affect how your

932
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,159
roots gonna come in like it will affect

933
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:52,158
you you don't think your way by the way

934
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,320
gotcha one more question which is the

935
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,640
the ph of it you said you monitor the ph

936
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,960
i know you have a blue lab ph pen

937
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,320
what ph do you aim for in your aeroponic

938
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,120
cloner

939
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:05,278
i i aim for a 6.2 everything

940
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:07,918
okay and then did you do like a ppm or

941
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:11,599
ec as well do you do any type of i did

942
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,278
ppms a few times um

943
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:13,959
it's not too much math i'm not doing

944
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:17,519
that

945
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:20,079
[Laughter]

946
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,038
i'm too much math uh it's too much

947
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:25,759
information to keep up with for me um

948
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:28,798
the ppms is good knowledge i research it

949
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:30,960
to understand how ppms work i do have my

950
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,798
setup to in case i need to do a runoff

951
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,880
because of like like i said i haven't

952
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:38,480
had any i haven't come across any issues

953
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,240
yet so i have things in place because

954
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,679
like i said i'll watch you i gotta watch

955
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,159
people in your problems i'm very

956
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,720
proactive i don't want problems but i do

957
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,880
set myself up in my grow so if my girl

958
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,000
type is set up for if a problem does

959
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,840
arise

960
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,919
i'm already set up for it so like for

961
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:56,240
example um i do

962
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,840
for my plants i bottom feed in a little

963
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,079
bit of a bottom water i should say

964
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:01,759
nothing i bottom water and i water on

965
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,759
top a little bit but

966
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,679
um i have a drain system a flattened

967
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,519
drain system yeah i was gonna actually

968
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,280
ask you about that and maybe we can get

969
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,239
into that next well first of all what

970
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,040
type of water do you use to use ro tap

971
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:17,439
well water use tap water okay talk to us

972
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:20,639
about your flood and drain tray diy

973
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,398
setup that you did okay so well intent

974
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,480
warsaw i'm lucky my tap water doesn't

975
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:27,358
come out that high like some people um

976
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,079
it relatively stays like at a 7.5

977
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:32,000
sometimes um during the winter to summer

978
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,639
transition right now for like the next

979
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,320
30 days it will jump up a little bit so

980
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,039
i gotta watch it a little bit and it'll

981
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,800
go back down and normally when you

982
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:43,838
straight out of my tap it's a seven like

983
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,919
strap attack um so i don't really have

984
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:47,679
like it'll adjust itself once i put the

985
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,759
water in the dirt like

986
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,000
um by still check it um

987
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,119
my flying train says system thank you

988

00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,559
so

992
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,680
[Music]

993
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:04,960
i'm older i'm i'm and i'm lazy organics

994
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:07,519
again well we're not going to do i don't

995
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,880
want to keep bending over my back like

996
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:10,480
so

997
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,079
i don't have plants off the floor i'm in

998
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,880
the basement now because i started

999
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,880
learning how to grow an indoor garden

1000
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,640
upstairs in my home so in my home i have

1001
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,280
carpet you know in the room or whatever

1002
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:23,920
as my knowledge is expanding my grow is

1003
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,000
expanding so i ended up moving into my

1004
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,760
basement but my basement is concrete

1005
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,119
towards like anyone else's business so

1006
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,920
it was colder on the floor um so i

1007
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,000
wanted to get my plants off the floor

1008
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,880
and um so i started off with building

1009
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,838
tables and i don't want to order tables

1010
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,400
chris they wanted 600 a table

1011
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,799
like i'm not paying you 6000 table like

1012
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,760
that's the price in my i'm not doing it

1013
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,680
so

1014
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,680
i uh

1015
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,078
learned to build tables from watching

1016
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:56,639
vader um

1017
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,640
that video said you know the the trick

1018
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:01,598
in that videos you need two people so on

1019
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:03,679
my video is just me on on vader's video

1020
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:07,119
here's the right follow later okay he

1021
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:09,039
got two people you need two people

1022
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,039
but um it was a third of the calls for

1023
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:17,838
building building tables um so i built

1024
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:20,639
two tables and then i came across a

1025
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:21,599
dog out dog was building a drug drain

1026
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:24,159
system

1027
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,720
and um the only thing i didn't like

1028
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:28,799
about his training system was his um his

1029
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:30,959
pumping the way he was pumping out so i

1030
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,720
had to go back and research on how i

1031
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,720
wanted my punch to go

1032
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:37,519
and no one had it like no one had like a

1033
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:39,759
system at first um

1034
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:42,079
so on my flat tables and you should just

1035
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:45,520
saw me crush weights

1036
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,960
this is what i mean by hooking so

1037
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,920
such a girl

1038
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,880
i did not measure the tables right so i

1039
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,400
did the tables in my tent already so of

1040
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,160
course you have to buy

1041
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,838
the flat drain stuff like the drain

1042
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,598
tables so

1043
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:01,119
i never measured the drain table like i

1044
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,960
just didn't do it so

1045
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,000
i get to the hydroponics store and i'm

1046
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,960
like

1047
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,280
yeah that looks like it'll fit

1048
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,119
good one i'll get two of those and when

1049
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,920
in my eye site

1050
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,920
so ladies make sure you either learn how

1051
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,079
to take measurements or get you to

1052
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,000
google measure on your phone lesson

1053
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,119
learn i learned to measure things out

1054
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,039
now this is why i buy these tables

1055
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,920
thinking that they were going to fit

1056
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:30,400
when i got home these tables was twice

1057
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,240
the size of the table that i built like

1058
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,920
in my mind about whatever the flat

1059
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:36,319
things were the same but they were not

1060
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,838
the same they were humongous like they

1061
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,519
were so big

1062
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,358
they were like big built for like a 10

1063
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:43,838
by 10 or something

1064
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:46,480
so i had to go back and um get the

1065
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:48,639
smaller versions so now i get those and

1066
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,079
i'm trying to figure out where

1067
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:51,679
i'm going to put the pump there like

1068
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,440
some people have the trash can to pump

1069
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:54,799
the water out i'm trying to figure out

1070
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,800
how to pump the water out none of that

1071
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,480
worked for me limited space

1072
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,240
um and i wanted to be more convenient so

1073
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,559
i remember making the

1074
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,159
uh the cloning machines i was just like

1075
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,639
you know what

1076
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:11,199
back to home depot we go and i go get

1077
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:13,039
the tubs so now i have 14 gallon tubs

1078
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:14,399
under my tables

1079
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:16,159
and now i got to figure out where i'm

1080
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,599
gonna put the tubing in

1081
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:19,679
i'm such a girl

1082
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,440
i'm like not measuring nothing out again

1083
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:22,639
so i look and at the bottom of your

1084
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,960
plate people if you look at your

1085
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:26,400
draining tables you have these little

1086
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,240
circles you probably would never pay

1087
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,559
attention to it but there's these little

1088
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:32,639
circles on both sides right in front of

1089
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:34,880
the numbers like so on your drain table

1090
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,719
should say like two feet three feet you

1091
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,119
know you should have numbers and right

1092
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:41,118
above that is these two little circles

1093
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,358
um and i drove the holes in those

1094
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,079
circles put the tubes in and then i used

1095
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:49,199
epoxy just filming and i got that idea

1096
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,599
from some guy that was building

1097
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:54,559
a a water phone

1098
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,160
he was building a water phone and

1099
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:58,480
uh

1100
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:01,039
he just had his little seven dollar pump

1101
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,559
thing you want to go in water go out

1102
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,719
that's how he explained it and when he

1103
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:06,799
said it i was like that sounds genius i

1104
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:10,000
go back to the store for five bucks i

1105
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,079
get water going water go out and um

1106
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,480
i'll box it and they fit right into the

1107
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,480
little hole that i made and um

1108
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,519
you plug it up into the uh air which you

1109
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:23,679
call it the stone the air pump was the

1110
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:26,079
air pump i used the air pumps again and

1111
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:27,279
once again i had some points free air

1112
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,240
pumps

1113
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,839
um and uh i plug in you know all the

1114
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:33,439
tubing and stuff that i got from home

1115
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:35,440
depot and you just got to figure out

1116
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,720
about your air pumps what size tubes you

1117
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,679
want to use

1118
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:42,719
um and i put going in system and going

1119
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:44,159
out system going into going out to um

1120
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:45,759
and i played with that for a while

1121
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:46,879
filled it up see how i went up see i

1122
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,359
went down

1123
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,240
and it happened to work now the problem

1124
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:55,119
with that was chris was

1125
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:57,679
in order to water the plants i would

1126
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,720
physically have to go downstairs

1127
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:02,159
and

1128
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,159
plug the pump up

1129
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:05,679
that'll defeat the purpose of me

1130
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,920
building this whole table like that a

1131
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:10,960
couple of democrats like i'm with myself

1132
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,760
jay that is so stupid like i gotta go

1133
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,358
downstairs and plug it in just

1134
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,119
what did you put the tables for you guys

1135
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:20,318
and just hand water

1136
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:22,720
so then i sat back and i realized um i

1137
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:25,519
know what i was gonna do i had the new

1138
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:28,159
hub then we'd grow up and i just didn't

1139
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,838
work well for me um

1140
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:33,358
so i didn't know what i was going to do

1141
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:35,039
and then i had the ring doorbell

1142
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:36,960
and i'm sitting in my house and the ring

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,599
programs you have like for your housing

1153
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,119
or whatever so i proceeded to plug the

1154
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,519
um the pumps into those downloaded to my

1155
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:06,480
phone and i'm like god i hope this works

1156
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:09,599
and guess what it works so now it turns

1157
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,440
on for an hour and i can leave the water

1158
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,000
on as long as i want

1159
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,000
and um a program how many times a day i

1160
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,800
wanted to come on depending on where i'm

1161
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,559
at in the veg or the flower stage and um

1162
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,920
if it orders itself the only thing i

1163
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:26,239
have to do is uh once a week make sure

1164
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,280
the water at the bottom and where in the

1165
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:31,598
reservoirs are ph correctly not i'm

1166
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,440
cleaning them out and they are full

1167
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,920
so i went from watering like every day

1168
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,599
my hand water every day to just check it

1169
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,240
on water once a week that's awesome that

1170
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,880
makes things so much easier i have a

1171
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,879
auto watering system myself i use the

1172
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,119
blue mats so i've been using those blue

1173
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,559
matte carrots and hooked up to reservoir

1174
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,559
it's gravity fed so as long as it's

1175
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:52,880
above kind of the grill pot you know

1176
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:55,279
come down and it'll automatically drop

1177
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,519
down as the medium dries out so that's

1178
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,920
been easier i've used the auto pot

1179
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:01,519
systems in the past where it's basically

1180
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,960
same thing gravity fed goes to the

1181
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,358
bottom of the grill pot and it's like

1182
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,440
bottom feeding and it wicks its way up

1183
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:08,880
but those things save so much time you

1184
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,480
know it's like you mentioned like hand

1185
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,039
watering it can be

1186
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,719
it can be time consuming and depending

1187
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:16,400
on your growth setup like if you're if

1188
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,480
you need to like

1189
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,079
get back into your grow tent because

1190
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,119
you've got other plants in front like

1191
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,160
then you've got to move plants out of

1192
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,240
the tent

1193
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:25,039
you know lean into your tent like it can

1194
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:27,439
be

1195
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,960
a lot easier to have an auto watering

1196
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,599
system set up at some point whether it

1197
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,599
be blue mats auto pot flood and drain

1198
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,640
trays right you know so on and so forth

1199
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,838
so it's pretty cool that you actually

1200
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:37,519
got to that point now you're probably

1201
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:41,039
saving a ton of time

1202
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:44,318
i am because normally um i was in my

1203
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:45,119
gardens for like 13 hours a day it felt

1204
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:46,239
like

1205
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,400
now

1206
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:49,679
between me switching my soil over to

1207
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,358
organics

1208
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:55,440
and then me also um

1209
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:58,719
doing to automatic watering

1210
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,400
i'm a lazy gardener girl i'm so lazy i

1211
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:02,000
gotta find a new project now i had

1212
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,838
nothing to do i'd be bored i'd be just

1213
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,679
messing with the plants for no reason

1214
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:07,119
you know how you got i had to you know

1215
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:10,000
go back to the basics i gotta keep

1216
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,760
myself keeping simple because if i don't

1217
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,280
i've been just messing around messing

1218
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,280
the plants up so because there'll be

1219
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,560
nothing to do now so

1220
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,079
um

1221
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,799
now i just

1222
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,750
um take on new products

1223
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,880
i'm gonna grow some spring things

1224
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:26,960
[Laughter]

1225
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,119
so you mentioned in the beginning how

1226
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,960
you kind of throw together your mix your

1227
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,599
soil mix you have amendments in it to

1228
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,280
begin but how about later on in the grow

1229
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,519
right so what nutrients are you using

1230
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,800
and when are you actually like feeding

1231
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:40,880
like i'm assuming that you said you're

1232
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,800
organic now so i'm assuming you're doing

1233
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,960
some sort of like top dressing you know

1234
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:49,039
what do you use when do you apply it

1235
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,079
so i top dress i use um doctors dr earth

1236
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:53,119
um

1237
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,519
i use those and um their whole line is

1238
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,358
to me it's awesome it's a little smelly

1239
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:59,759
but it's pretty awesome

1240
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:02,799
um like i said uh

1241
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,480
organics i take a bucket

1242
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,880
uh from home depot yeah that's my

1243
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,000
favorite store um i take a bucket from

1244
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,720
home for the paint bucket and i go and i

1245
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,440
get the dry amendments from

1246
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:17,279
my my local carbonic store or about to

1247
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,119
order them and i took the whole boxes of

1248
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,800
them and i just mix them together in the

1249
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,039
trash bag really well

1250
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,039
and then i'll double the bag out and i

1251
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:26,480
shake it like that you shaking chicken

1252
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:29,440
i'm not shaking shake it shake it shake

1253
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:32,480
shake it put it in the um

1254
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:35,519
in the bucket put the lid on it and then

1255
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,599
i feed my plants

1256
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:39,920
and veg in the beginning i stopped

1257
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,960
dressing in the beginning and they

1258
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,000
pretty much lasted me about 30 days in

1259
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,720
veg

1260
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,480
so

1261
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:49,039
i don't have to feed it again now i do

1262
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,440
use in between that um

1263
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:53,679
what i call tree stump which is like a

1264
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,838
recharge so for better lack of terms it

1265
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:57,759
is a recharge for me i like tree stump i

1266
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:59,679
don't use recharge nothing against me

1267
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,800
charged up i work pretty awesome for i

1268
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:05,199
see um but i just that's just my brain

1269
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,960
and it's just cheaper um

1270
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:08,639
and it does the same thing

1271
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,400
and the reason why i probably also use

1272
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,799
it is because tree stump does not need

1273
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,358
to be irrigated i can just pour it right

1274
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,760
into some water you know measure it out

1275
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:20,078
um i'm not gonna figure that out um

1276
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,079
measure that out and put it in the water

1277
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,400
and it's ready to go off the back and if

1278
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,440
i run out my local hydroponic store also

1279
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,440
gives you

1280
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,960
free already made um tea every tuesday

1281
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,760
um just gotta bring it you gotta to

1282
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,920
bring container um but i use that so i

1283
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,079
use tree stump every

1284
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,159
about once a week about once a week i

1285
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,119
use it once a week um

1286
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:41,838
and then

1287
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,920
in

1288
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:46,799
flower i'll chop dress again in flower

1289
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,680
um

1290
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,280
and then i don't have to do it again

1291
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:53,358
that's it i saw pretty much feed

1292
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,480
probably twice during my cycles in the

1293
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:58,480
beginning and then um

1294
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,559
in the beginning of a

1295
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,559
flower yeah so that's the only two times

1296
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:04,159
that i feed and it's in the dirt now

1297
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:06,719
like i said before because i've been

1298
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:08,480
running my organics for a minute now

1299
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:11,118
that feed is already constantly in my

1300
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,280
dirt it's constantly mother so i don't

1301
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,200
have to feed as much i will say the

1302
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,519
first time me ever switching over to

1303
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:20,239
driver members though i did have to type

1304
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:22,318
dress twice in veg and then twice and

1305
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:24,559
flower to get to the level where now i

1306
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:25,599
don't have to do that so

1307
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:27,119
um

1308
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,480
that's where that's it and that's a

1309
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,160
point

1310
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,519
that's pretty straightforward

1311
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:33,440
now how about

1312
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:35,599
environment conditions first of all do

1313
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,200
you supplement co2 and then also what do

1314
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:40,559
you aim for for temperature and humidity

1315
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:41,919
so when it comes to temperature humidity

1316
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:43,838
that's tough to answer for me and the

1317
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,838
reason why i say that is because some

1318
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:48,239
people have a baseline of what they go

1319
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:49,679
off i go off the cultivar so i go off

1320
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:51,919
when i'm growing so

1321
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:53,919
um i have grown some cultures where

1322
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,800
they'd like the temperature to be you

1323
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,200
know 86 and humanity to be like 69

1324
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,160
percent and i have grown some cultivars

1325
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:03,118
where

1326
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:04,239
um they like the regular based on 72 78

1327
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,039
you know something like that is

1328
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:08,879
temperature-wise and then

1329
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:12,318
62-65 for humidity depending on the

1330
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:16,079
situation um so i pretty much researched

1331
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:18,000
a plan and then maybe for me i i i

1332
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,079
stress them like some people do training

1333
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,760
i'm not i don't train but i do i will

1334
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,440
stress to plant the hell out though i

1335
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,200
will stress you out to your necks to see

1336
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,280
what happens if i don't give you air

1337
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:28,879
well you don't have no airflow if you if

1338
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,440
your temperature is too high if your

1339
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,039
temperature is too low i will stress the

1340
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,280
plan out just to understand that

1341
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:37,920
particular cultivar or what the baseline

1342
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,760
should be for them typical so that's how

1343
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,639
that's how i do mine so if you're

1344
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:45,040
talking about let's just say you know

1345
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:47,920
for back a lot of terms a green pepper

1346
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:49,119
and this type of green pepper once um

1347
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,559
you know

1348
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:55,039
80 degrees temperature and then you know

1349
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:57,519
66 humidity that's when i get that green

1350
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:59,599
pepper but now i might have a red pepper

1351
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:02,318
that wants you know um

1352
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,240
temperatures to be at 72 and uh humidity

1353
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:06,480
is 62 they're going to a different and

1354
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:08,558
that's what you're getting um so that's

1355
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,719
pretty much how i do that so i can have

1356
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,160
two cup like i have two tents going on

1357
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:13,279
and they're gonna have two different

1358
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:14,799
environments they're not gonna have to

1359
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,480
take anybody not gonna come into my

1360
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,000
tents and see all the same environment

1361
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,679
they're all different

1362
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,440
gotcha now do you do anything with with

1363
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:24,000
co2

1364
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,039
no i'm just now learning to

1365
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,639
um

1366
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:29,039
as of right now where i'm at with

1367
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:31,039
research-wise i haven't i come across

1368
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:33,679
that i probably don't still need it yet

1369
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:36,318
um me just brave enough it's cool pretty

1370
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:40,399
much um i do want to

1371
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:41,199
i do want to try it out just to um

1372
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,400
see

1373
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:45,118
i am interested to see like firsthand

1374
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,720
see

1375
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,800
not just on the video of the difference

1376
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:51,759
but i haven't tried it yet so no i don't

1377
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,720
use co2 gotcha yeah i i've been using

1378
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:57,119
those tnb naturals canisters okay and

1379
00:48:54,719 --> 00:49:00,318
now i actually just bought one of those

1380
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,920
exhale bags xl co2 bags so i'm going to

1381
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:03,679
be using those for the first time and

1382
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,000
seeing how that compares to the

1383
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:08,000
canisters so now how does the canvas

1384
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,639
work from you not having the canisters

1385
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,800
i've monitored like the ppm levels that

1386
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:15,598
you also monitor ppm

1387
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:18,800
for co2 as well and i've been able to

1388
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,640
get upwards of a thousand even more at

1389
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,240
some points you know assuming it's a

1390
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:24,639
sealed environment now sometimes i'm

1391
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:27,279
exhausting oftentimes i'm exhausting the

1392
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:28,639
air so keeping that up past a thousand

1393
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,480
just it doesn't really work what the

1394
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:33,519
canister is for me but monitoring the

1395
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:37,280
ppm levels i have got it up typically on

1396
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:39,679
average maybe 700 800 ppm but upwards of

1397
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,000
a thousand so it does definitely work

1398
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:44,799
compared to just not doing any sort of

1399
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,960
co2

1400
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,920
no big difference so now i gotta go

1401
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,920
downstairs and start ppm and y'all and

1402
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,680
oxygen because you know mr gross said

1403
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,920
that's what it is you know he didn't no

1404
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:58,639
you don't have balls in this the boss

1405
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,480
has spoken so that i wanted

1406
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:03,039
man

1407
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,559
i i think measuring co2 is i mean some

1408
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:06,239
people would say it's an overkill to

1409
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:09,040
even measure i mean the meters cost so

1410
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:10,959
much yeah generally people don't even

1411
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:12,639
bother to get any type of co2

1412
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,440
measurement going so

1413
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:15,440
i'm going to try one

1414
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,559
i am so

1415
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:23,040
you know you have quite a bit of several

1416
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:25,440
years experience growing what advice do

1417
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:27,599
you have for someone who's just starting

1418
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,760
to grow for the first time ask yourself

1419
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:32,079
do you really want to grow

1420
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,160
do you want to be a consumer of the

1421
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,640
things that you're growing or do you

1422
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:38,719
want to get into agriculture understand

1423
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:41,118
that if you're going to do this

1424
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:43,759
then do your research um

1425
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,039
the one thing i'm learning in in this is

1426
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,160
just do you

1427
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:50,318
like um growing for me has been taught

1428
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:52,399
me to be okay with failure i'll say this

1429
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:54,880
a lot going for me has taught me to be

1430
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,680
okay with failure at one point

1431
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,079
i thought failing was not an option

1432
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:03,279
um i used to stress myself out if i felt

1433
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:05,200
that something you know um i would beat

1434
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,640
myself up if i thought that something i

1435
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:08,159
felt like for failure and like anyone

1436
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:09,440
else i got mental stress and i looks

1437
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:11,440
like other people

1438
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,920
um and they played a big part in my

1439
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:17,039
mental and failure played a big part my

1440
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:19,838
muscle i was terrified of professionally

1441
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:21,838
um so for me for um gardening it taught

1442
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:25,039
me to be okay with failure it's

1443
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:27,519
something to embrace failure um and with

1444
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:29,279
that you learn when you embrace failure

1445
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:31,519
i learned that you learn more things

1446
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,359
about yourself it reveals things about

1447
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:36,639
yourself so for me

1448
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:38,239
gardening has taught me a lot about me

1449
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:40,000
um

1450
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:42,879
and i'll give you an example authors are

1451
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,239
kind of off topic um as women we get i

1452
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,640
guess like

1453
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:49,039
better i guess you want to call it um a

1454
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:52,960
bitter [ __ ] no i'm joking

1455
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:55,358
um but uh for me

1456
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,159
it embraced failure which taught me to

1457
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:59,519
be okay with certain things and

1458
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:01,358
i fell in love

1459
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:05,358
with falling in love again which is a

1460
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:07,279
dopest thing ever right so um

1461
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:09,039
i may love my plants i'm in love with

1462
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,400
gardening i'm in love with myself all

1463
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:12,079
over again i'm in love with who i'm

1464
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,960
becoming through gardening

1465
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:15,599
um

1466
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,440
i'm in love with the interactions um i

1467
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,680
get to meet with people

1468
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,240
um so for me regarding i feel like if

1469
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:24,078
you're going to do this do your research

1470
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,838
be okay with what you want to do don't

1471
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:27,839
let nobody

1472
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:29,279
and and i say this because like earlier

1473
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:31,199
i was somewhat germination like one of

1474
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,079
my biggest player reservations because i

1475
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:36,159
allowed everybody else's way to get in

1476
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,599
my head on how to germinate

1477
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:40,078
and

1478
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,680
not remembering how i started my first

1479
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,680
grow ever my first girl ever with

1480
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:45,199
germination was never an issue and they

1481
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:47,759
had an issue and that was an issue was

1482
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:49,358
dirt like that was my issue um and now

1483
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,319
if i got issue with germination that's

1484
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:54,719
because i allow everyone else to tell me

1485
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:56,318
what's right and what's wrong and

1486
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:58,318
and growing there's no right or wrong

1487
00:52:56,318 --> 00:53:00,159
way i i you know it's no like this is

1488
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:03,039
wrong or that's wrong you should be ppm

1489
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:05,358
you should know our dvds like no no

1490
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:08,400
that's not how this works like i'm going

1491
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:11,279
to do my gardening to where i see fit

1492
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,519
um that helps me out what goes on in my

1493
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,920
garden what goes on in my climate what

1494
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:17,280
goes on in my neck of the woods so i

1495
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,599
feel like if you're going to start

1496
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,599
growing and and get into gardening do

1497
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,039
what makes you happy i don't give a darn

1498
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,039
if you want to grow

1499
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:27,119
blueberries from the damn ceiling you

1500
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:28,239
know like if you want to try that try

1501
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,599
that you know i mean don't let anybody

1502
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:30,719
say oh you can't grow blueberries from

1503
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:32,720
the children well how are you gonna know

1504
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:34,239
if you don't try you all know i guess

1505
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:35,679
people are growing stuff straight up now

1506
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:37,199
just straight up and down they would

1507
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:39,598
have never known that if they didn't try

1508
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:41,358
it you know what i mean so try it and if

1509
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:43,599
it don't work guess what it just don't

1510
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:45,039
work try it again and then if you ever

1511
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,400
try and try something different you know

1512
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:48,880
what i mean and

1513
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,318
if people don't like it then they like

1514
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,640
it that's how i feel about it don't let

1515
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:55,119
nobody tell you not what not to do and

1516
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:57,118
that's um that's what we do at kansas

1517
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,280
should stand for do not tell me what i

1518
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,960
cannot do sis i can do whatever i put my

1519
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,319
mind to so don't let nobody say you

1520
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,159
can't do nothing and that's just

1521
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:06,480
basically it that's the only advice i'll

1522
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:08,318
give you do what you want make your own

1523
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,440
world it's just your world and then they

1524
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:11,838
don't like your world sometimes i say

1525
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,838
get out

1526
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:14,719
that's it

1527
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,000
definitely some really good advice there

1528
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:17,759
for sure

1529
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,280
