gardening um not really intentionally

92
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:27,840
I'll say my first time planning anything

93
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:30,400
at all was um probably about like uh

94
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,878
Elementary School ages um

95
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,719
just um with my grandmother

96
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:38,719
um I I was raised with like my cousins

97
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,719
my sisters my brothers all in like one

98
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,120
house my grandmother had a house that

99
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,759
was big enough to where like my mom or

100
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,878
anybody that would have

101
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:48,840
problems that needed like place to stay

102
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,719
we all go to my grandma's house and

103
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,878
everybody else was busy my my cousin's

104
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,759
like doing like they were dancing like

105
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:57,000
in Dan's Cruise like doing all this

106
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,560
stuff and I didn't know i' do none of

107
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,639
that so um most of my time I would spend

108
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,519
with my grandma like in the garden like

109
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:05,438
um just learning random things I didn't

110
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,280
even realize I was learning at the time

111
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:10,199
I was too busy into bugs and like rly

112
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,079
poliy and all that like I was already in

113
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:16,439
the dirt so she was like oh hand me this

114
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,918
hand me that and um I grew uh Keys like

115
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:20,160
I think they were snow PE the first

116
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,599
guack I went over there to Home Depot

117
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,720
grabbed one of the Burpee packs and

118
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,720
threw that along side of her actual

119
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,560
plant and uh yeah that was my first son

120
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,880
kind of sprout that's awesome and

121
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,199
getting into your gross style cckm

122
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:38,120
fromong you're indoor only I believe

123
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,639
you're in soil is that right and then

124
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:44,160
are you growing with Organic inputs or

125
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,240
synthetic so I'm going uh I'm growing

126
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,800
with Organic right now um my last round

127
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,840
I did uh try synthetic but it ended up

128
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,800
being like a syic mix that was not the

129
00:04:53,839 --> 00:05:00,239
best idea um but um before that I was

130
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,680
organic so I was like I'm going back to

131
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,160
our G that was the best way for me I

132
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,560
feel like I was able to like

133
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,759
uh get more like leave like get more

134
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,360
time with my PL some in bed or anything

135
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:16,199
like that if uh I had any issues it

136
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,319
would give me a couple days to fix those

137
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:22,000
issues rather than like immediate same

138
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,600
day with Coco like if if you up it's

139
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,038
going to show you like today or tomorrow

140
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,039
and you only got the next day or the day

141
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:32,199
before to fix it if not you're done and

142
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:34,918
um that was just a little stressful for

143
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,759
me I I do want to learn down the line I

144
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:41,079
feel like um if you're growing Coco as a

145
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,639
beginner then um you got to do a lot

146
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:45,318
more education and a lot more like you

147
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,280
got to watch a lot more videos read a

148
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:49,680
lot more books byy as many books as you

149
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,839
can before you actually grow the plant

150
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,959
if I was to advise another beginner I'll

151
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,719
tell them to grow um in soil just

152
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,359
because it's going to give them time to

153
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,479
actually learn what they need to do and

154
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,800
um learn about Coco while you're growing

155
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:06,079
in soil and then go back to Coco yeah I

156
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,079
think each way has its own kind of

157
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,719
benefits and drawbacks right there are

158
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,959
so many like pros and cons to growing in

159
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,960
all these different methods and yeah it

160
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,839
kind of comes down to trying things out

161
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,638
like you mentioned and uh finding out

162
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:22,079
what works best for you yeah soil does

163
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,519
suck with like uh overwatering you can

164
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,359
overwater and it will kind of stay there

165
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:28,839
for a couple days um with Coco if you

166
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,479
over water is probably going to run out

167
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:32,799
and then you get kind of turn up the

168
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,439
heat or do whatever with your BPD to get

169
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,280
that water out soil you're going to get

170
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,240
PM if you try to do all

171
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,879
that um that's the only difference that

172
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,918
I've found I'm pretty sure there's a lot

173
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:47,800
more I got to learn down the line but um

174
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:50,279
right now I feel like soil was uh a

175
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,800
better thing for me I know based off of

176
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,439
like uh previously being into reptiles

177
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,840
and bugs and things like that I know

178
00:06:54,439 --> 00:07:01,598
what just needs to go into uh soil to

179
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:05,478
keep it living so to keep other things

180
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:07,800
living um and it's just the easiest way

181
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:10,519
to go for me I hear you on that one for

182
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,639
sure so I want to warp back to your old

183
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:15,639
grow setup pretend like you're walking

184
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,918
into your grow room can you explain what

185
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,120
equipment you had back then how was set

186
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,918
up how many plants you were growing so

187
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,639
on and so forth so yeah when I

188
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:30,198
um previously I would say like a month

189
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:32,720
or two before the Pimp My grow

190
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,160
um before you guys all came out I was

191
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,080
like trying different things that I was

192
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,759
on offer up and I was on like Facebook

193
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,959
groups like getting different tents and

194
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,439
trying to they were all like T they

195
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,239
would have like holes in them a little

196
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,439
rip on the side or something like but uh

197
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,038
there's uh the room that you guys ended

198
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:51,319
up coming that had a couple plants in I

199
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:53,318
think if you go back to my YouTube uh

200
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:57,120
couple previous videos before that I had

201
00:07:53,319 --> 00:08:00,280
uh huge 10 by10 I got from somebody on

202
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,478
offer of with no like uh uh I still had

203
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:06,878
the small light in there um there was no

204
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:08,519
intake fan there was no like fans moving

205
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,319
around the air and I kept walking in

206
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,318
that one room you guys came in to help

207
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,919
build out it pretty much you couldn't

208
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,639
even walk it was like you walk in barely

209
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:20,038
be able to crack the door and walked in

210
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,720
there and it was like 100° bro and I was

211
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:24,079
only able to do that for a couple days I

212
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,560
was like this is crazy there's no way

213
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:31,158
I'm going to be able to do this um this

214
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:33,559
is super cheap like almost can't tent so

215
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:37,158
I ended up taking that out and at that

216
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:38,639
time I had so many plants that uh it

217
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:40,759
just wasn't working out I didn't know

218
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,038
how to like control my VPD I didn't know

219
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:46,080
how to do any of that especially with

220
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:48,600
the stuff I had I was still trying but

221
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,839
um I I would I would watch videos I knew

222
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,600
what I was supposed to get Target wise

223
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:57,880
it just wasn't hitting from me things

224
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,600
and and areas and different type of tin

225
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:03,958
that wasn't marking so

226
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,879
um originally when you guys hit me up uh

227
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:08,159
Joe told me he was like yo this is this

228
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,919
is really dope you know I see everything

229
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,639
you're doing but

230
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:15,120
um we can't come when there's in all

231
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,278
these plants bro this has to be proper

232
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,679
and um I thought that was sick I was

233
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:23,039
like you know this is super dope um and

234
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:25,399
I ended up basically

235
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:28,958
uh making

236
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:31,360
um everything the way it it needed to be

237
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:35,518
to be like you know to have have a dope

238
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,800
show and um I I took so many plants to

239
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,919
my girlfriend's

240
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:44,559
house it it was wild like uh in in the

241
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:47,479
the big U-Haul boxes that you hang cloes

242
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:50,278
in I like packed those in and took all

243
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,920
my plants to my girlfriend's house and

244
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:53,600
by that time that I had to bring

245
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,278
everything back and everything it was

246
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,560
just everything was so dead and

247
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:01,439
everything was so bent over

248
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:04,159
and it was just it was wild a wild

249
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:08,240
time definitely a moment to remember

250
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:11,480
forever but it's such a crazy story yeah

251
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,320
I remember walking into your old setup

252
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,560
and you had the light how did you how

253
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,600
you it was on some sort of I'm trying to

254
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:23,719
think of what he even call that it was a

255
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:27,320
two two tripod post for like regular

256
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,879
lights I think like the uh I forgot the

257
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:35,360
brain but two regular

258
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:39,519
um soft light sticks tripods and a pole

259
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:45,440
across it for hanging backdrop and I had

260
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:47,759
a Viper Spectra 150 on one side and I

261
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,480
believe yeah I think two Viper specters

262
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,600
hanging on that it was just giving the

263
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,839
plants enough light to keep them alive

264
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,120
and it was open room at that point there

265
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,800
was no air exhausting out the room at

266
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,959
all it's kind of just like not even a

267
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:04,159
sealed room room um but yeah when you

268
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:07,799
guys came I was like on the verge of

269
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:09,639
like like my it was almost over from my

270
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,799
plans like almost over for my growing

271
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:14,560
career in general I didn't even know

272
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:16,240
that it could go any farther or go like

273
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,719
I had all these dreams and stuff but I

274
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,079
didn't know that I could keep going I

275
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,519
didn't know I was going to be afford to

276
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:24,000
keep going any of this stuff so when you

277
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,360
guys reach out and I actually like

278
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
uh not one I was like what the hell cuz

279
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,320
uh I originally seen the link one of my

280
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,519
friends sent sent a link and it was like

281
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,600
a video already made and I was like no

282
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:42,039
way I'm not there's no reason for me to

283
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,800
even sign up with and I signed up and

284
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:45,599
actually got hit up and I was like

285
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:48,319
there's no way I've never won anything

286
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,240
in my life this is a wild then these are

287
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,600
people I watch every at that point I was

288
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:57,200
watching your two channels from the

289
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,320
stash this channel um there's a guy

290
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,879
named John ker um grow your greens

291
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,240
that's like one of my favorite YouTubers

292
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:09,200
I was watching those three channels

293
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,799
um I don't know but that I I was doing

294
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,560
that all day long and growing and um so

295
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,838
I was trying to learn from basically all

296
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,239
those channels I felt like was that

297
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,839
would actually teach people to grow

298
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,320
different plants um fruits and you know

299
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,600
more things than the

300
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,079
normal Community would assume that

301
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,079
you're growing and um when I got a

302
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,278
chance to meet you guys that's why I was

303
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:36,000
so excited I was like yo Chris like you

304
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:38,919
have no idea but the I I respect it more

305
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,039
because there your knowled is uh

306
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:42,240
alongside with other plants yeah there

307
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,519
are so many different plants that you

308
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,000
can grow and I know people focus on one

309
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,639
or two different plants but uh yeah it's

310
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,120
exciting and they all bring in their own

311
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,079
unique challenges but yeah going back to

312
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,360
the the light yeah actually kind of

313
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:58,719
innovative having those on the softbox

314
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,680
tripods and then I guess that's the way

315
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,240
you're able to adjusted I remember you

316
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:06,239
didn't even have like light ratchets on

317
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,639
there I think it was just like no it was

318
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,799
two string and like other things that

319
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,680
would look like rope yeah it was like

320
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,519
the ghetto pulley system you definitely

321
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:17,799
had a lot of struggles there from the

322
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:21,360
lighting to no intake fan no ventilation

323
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:24,078
no oscillating fans it was wow and then

324
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,639
at the same time that that place was

325
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:29,879
like the building was like from the 80s

326
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,278
or 7s like filthy and

327
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:35,159
it was just it it was so hard to deal

328
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:37,679
with sorry to cut you off but that yeah

329
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:40,240
thank God I'm out of there heat issues

330
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:44,120
airflow issues man it was just not

331
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:47,120
optimal for growing I got to ask how did

332
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:50,039
this you know lack of equipment impact

333
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,799
plan Health yield overall growing

334
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:56,559
efficiency everything

335
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:59,240
um I would say I guess I'm going get

336
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:01,239
into later when you ask about the new

337
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,079
been try not to lean more towards that

338
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:08,720
right now but I would say it was just so

339
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:12,159
hot and like uh I'm learning now that

340
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,680
it's not really all about like uh as

341
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:18,120
much light intake as everybody is like

342
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:21,278
preaching on preaching on I understand

343
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,519
it but I'm believing airflow is way more

344
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:26,559
important way more important airf flow

345
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:29,159
getting rid of the air and bringing in

346
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,679
and keeping the freshest air if not the

347
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:35,559
air that that biome or whatever it is

348
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:39,799
whether it's for plants ants whatever it

349
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:41,879
is keep that air to or make fresh air in

350
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:44,000
that area you're going to have the best

351
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:45,958
thriving environment that you want

352
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,039
that's really the truth besides like

353
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:50,239
light light is going to like in every

354
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:52,599
environment needs their own light and

355
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,320
even like how they say the this is weird

356
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,600
but how they say the world spins like

357
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,600
our light is going to change for us

358
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,600
throughout our lifetime so so you can't

359
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,600
say that needs to stay like this 20 50

360
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,240
years later is going to be the rules are

361
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:13,600
going to change so it's just a lot

362
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,440
more a little Stoner thought but yeah

363
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,360
yeah cuz back then you weren't even

364
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,320
really controlling the environment right

365
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,278
temperature relative humidity CO2 air

366
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,839
circulation all of that was kind of like

367
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:25,360
I want say neglected right cuz you just

368
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,720
didn't have the equipment to do anything

369
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:32,440
right it was hope I I had a I had a

370
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,399
small 6 in like a AC Infinity fan that I

371
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:38,319
got from uh it's a girl named Coco Endor

372
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:41,039
on um Instagram and uh he actually was

373
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:43,479
the one that was like yo bro you should

374
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,439
just actually start growing like you

375
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,560
should make a YouTube you should make a

376
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,319
Instagram I was like why would I do that

377
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:51,159
like why would I show people gr like

378
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:54,078
that's

379
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:55,958
crazy and um he was actually growing

380
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,239
autos for years beforehand and I was

381
00:15:55,958 --> 00:16:01,638
like I was working with him to learn

382
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,919
like different things like that um but

383
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:07,240
he actually was like yeah one of the

384
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:12,039
ones that told me yo you kind of know

385
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:15,079
what you're doing so do it you know that

386
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:16,480
little small intake fan that I had was

387
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:18,439
uh I didn't

388
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,240
understand why it wasn't working I

389
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,399
didn't have the can to it I didn't have

390
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,639
like it was

391
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:27,679
just and I was using it as a fan to blow

392
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,680
out uh the air from one side of the tent

393
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:32,679
at the bottom and I was leave the other

394
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:35,159
side open so it was just cleaning the

395
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:37,838
air at all times I thought that was

396
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,639
doing something but not at all was

397
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,279
making everything Snell way louder than

398
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:45,839
it need and plants look shitty complete

399
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:48,480
shambles I think is a a good way to

400
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,519
explain your grow setup but things have

401
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,360
changed man let's fast forward to your

402
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:57,159
new grow setup explain what your grow

403
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,120
room looks like now so now um currently

404
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:01,879
I have a

405
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,119

setup like behind me I have a 2X two the

408
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,240

409
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,959
I've just been um working with the 4x8

still haven't been but that little thing

430
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:13,519
like people being actual real people I I

431
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,119
assume when I see like AI pictures or

432
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,400
like a a cartoon on the Instagram I just

433
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:20,719
I don't know why I assume all these

434
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,720
people are fake I think they're like not

435
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,000
real people and then I see people like

436
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,038
that chub has never had that chub has a

437
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,119
real picture but when I see people and I

438
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:33,519
hear real IC things is just reassure so

439
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,599
much for me bro it's crazy yeah there's

440
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,480
so many nice people in this community

441
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,759
that will literally take their shirt off

442
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,159
your back for you if needed and uh it's

443
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:45,679
really really cool to see yeah so yeah

444
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:47,200
from what I remember when the new setup

445
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,919
with AC Infinity I know you had

446
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,000
mentioned that you're no longer in that

447
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,240
location that we set up the grow room in

448
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,798
right yeah you're in a different

449
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:59,599
location but back then it was uh I think

450
00:18:54,798 --> 00:19:02,639
you had two 4x8 a 5x5 and a 2x4 right

451
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:04,759
yes sir so you had a drying a dedicated

452
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,759
drying tent which I think you're using

453
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:11,119
as a 5x5 the two 4x8 were both for

454
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,519
growing plants and then the 2x4 was for

455
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,000
clones and and seedlings is that right

456
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,158
that's what I wanted to do but I ended

457
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,599
up growing so many like I would just pop

458
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:23,720
beans every week bro I I still have the

459
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:26,439
problem for sure like i' I'm saying I

460
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,400
have a 2X two and 4x8 but there's

461
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,960
there's beans in my bathroom there's

462
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,480
beans in in my closet like there's beans

463
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,960
anywhere I can fit it's wild like every

464
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,038
couple days I'm popping beans um that

465
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,079
was a problem with that um like I said I

466
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:42,359
have the two

467
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:45,439
4x8 and the 5x5 and the I forgot what

468
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:48,639
the other one size wasse but um I ended

469
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,600
up having two veg tints two and two

470
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,200
flower tints so there was a flower tint

471
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,199
that was ready to go there was a flower

472
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,640
tint that was like probably 2 3 weeks

473
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,840
after that and there was like jeans and

474
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,840
then there germ so everything was pretty

475
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:05,519
much on a 3 we

476
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:10,279
like pretty close cycle to be able to

477
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:13,960
flip and then um when I learned or um at

478
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:15,519
that point I kind of like uh got offers

479
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,120
when I thought was like a job

480
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:21,599
opportunity to move out of state and

481
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:24,678
like work in the um flower

482
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:28,240
business oh man this is going to be dope

483
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:31,559
and I was like whatever I got to do chop

484
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,599
everything down pack this up um I

485
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:37,480
actually let a male rock out in this

486
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:39,119
room and then cross to my female so when

487
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,279
I get to location I don't have to take

488
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,879
any um clones I don't have to like try

489
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:46,599
to like keep anything alive when I get

490
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:50,159
to my location I'm run everything and

491
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:52,798
something good and that's kind of what

492
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,520
ended up happening but I still have to

493
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,400
cut everything and flow a little bit

494
00:20:54,519 --> 00:21:01,119
early probably like week seven week

495
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,240
eight like early eight so um yeah doing

496
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:05,079
all that and cutting everything down was

497
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,599
kind of like a buzz kill

498
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:10,879
but not getting that opportunity made me

499
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:12,319
realize and made me reach back out to

500
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,880
the family members like yo you need to

501
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,839
move back to LA like you need to move

502
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,320
back to what are you doing there nobody

503
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:21,359
there and I ended up moving back to Cali

504
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:24,278
and so much better like I see my family

505
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:26,558
every day like and I have the plants

506
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:29,798
growing in Vegas I was uh I had the

507
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:34,440
plants but every day like I only ate and

508
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:36,599
I only like I only did things like .1

509
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,759
miles away from where I was I was

510
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:41,359
watching everything at all times like if

511
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,359
people invited me somewhere I would pop

512
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:47,038
out for like 15 minutes and then they

513
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:49,278
like where he go I I was just paranoid I

514
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,879
I always thought someone was like trying

515
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:54,159
to you

516
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,120
know get what they had to get was while

517
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,120
yeah that was a bad area in Vegas where

518
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:00,359
you lived where we went that was like

519
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:03,359
right where the guy got his face a off

520
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:05,439
on the corner of really oh my gosh yeah

521
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,158
it was L that's terrible but overall

522
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,519
going to this new setup things it sounds

523
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,480
like things have gotten a lot easier for

524
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:12,798
you you know going from just an open

525
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,319
room to where you really don't have the

526
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:17,639
flexibility you didn't have the

527
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:19,038
flexibility to have plants and veg and

528
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,080
plants in flower two different light

529
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,720
cycles really is what I mean now you've

530
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:24,678
got all these different tents and you

531
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,679
can have them on different light cycles

532
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:28,120
different stages of growth can you name

533
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:32,320
some other ways that this new setup is

534
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:35,199
easier for for you um 100% for um

535
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:37,158
environment wise I'm actually really

536
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,038
learning like like I said I I've known a

537
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,760
little bit my whole life with like I

538
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:43,919
used to breed ball pythons different

539
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,759
things like that so with all those

540
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,759
things you have to like they only breed

541
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:49,879
in a certain temperature they only breed

542
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,599
with certain light like certain time of

543
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:57,559
the year kind of the same thing but I'm

544
00:22:52,599 --> 00:23:00,439
learning um how to provide the perfect

545
00:22:57,558 --> 00:23:04,720
atmosphere to where like the light and

546
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:07,000
the um the AC thing like 69 Pro will

547
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,919
kind of like it gauges you through how

548
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,759
to like change that so if your lights

549
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:17,120
are so hot and you just watered then you

550
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:18,879
should probably turn your intake fan up

551
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,879
that day and you just water you know

552
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,760
what I'm saying I mean just to get some

553
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,600
air out or what different things like

554
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,640
that like um I'm able to change that

555
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:32,000
instead of just work it at the same

556
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:34,520
exact level every time um I don't know

557
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,919
it does so much I can keep naming a

558
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:38,158
bunch of different things but even with

559
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:41,240
like

560
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:45,159
um I still plan on like going further

561
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:48,159
down like my breeding Lane and there's a

562
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:50,960
lot of different things like you cannot

563
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:55,159
have a human D at the end of like trying

564
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,919
to develop power you cannot have like um

565
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:00,200
different I have to have it in a whole

566
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:03,480
another area like the fact that I have

567
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:07,960
another light another tint and basically

568
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:11,679
a whole another you know grow I can take

569
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:16,038
to the other side and or family memb

570
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:18,200
house and still develop my um girl

571
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:19,879
that's amazing bro I would have never

572
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,600
even I would have thought maybe a couple

573
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,600
years down the line I'm going to do that

574
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,959
I have plans to do that I'm want to work

575
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:29,558
towards doing that but all those things

576
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,798
are like dreams so so now I actually

577
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:35,319
can't think like oh I have this project

578
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,319
at least I have the tools like I I know

579
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:38,558
where they are they're here with me or

580
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:40,558
they're with family members and I can

581
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,558
put those tools to work at any time

582
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:45,759
that's that's kind of amazing I did not

583
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:47,879
know that was POS yeah having that

584
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,839
controller that you mentioned definitely

585
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,960
definitely can make things a lot more

586
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:54,678
easier controlling the environment are

587
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,720
you using any equipment to control like

588
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:59,559
the relative humidity such as like a

589
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,399
humidifier or I imagine that you had to

590
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:03,440
use that in Vegas but now in California

591
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:06,000
are you using a dehumidifier now or or

592
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,440
still a humidifier not right now not

593
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,839
right now um let me see if I can

594
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,080
actually uh I'll stay here but I was

595
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:19,119
going to grab my controller to kind of

596
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:23,359
show but it it's kind of been like a 60

597
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:27,558
62 humidity and um a little bit high 70s

598
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:29,558
or like 75 uh temperature so I'm I'm

599
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:32,398
chilling I'm not worried about changing

600
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:35,319
that up pretty much it's been solid uh I

601
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:37,959
have the light level at uh

602
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:40,158
8 I haven't tried to push it up to

603
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:43,079
anything further than that they're on uh

604
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,799
week four maybe by the end I'll try to

605
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:48,359
push to 10 but still since I've had Evo

606
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:50,960
eights they're so strong I have not

607
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:53,359
tried to push 10 and running out the way

608
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,120
Joe did tell me he was like bro at 10

609
00:25:53,359 --> 00:26:01,038
from from jump I was like what you're

610
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:04,479
wild bro but um yeah he said running my

611
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:07,158
10 bro I don't know wow yeah those

612
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,519
lights are super powerful the Evo series

613
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:12,039
I have the EVO 3 myself I have two Evo

614
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,839
3s and I have an EVO 6 and like you

615
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:19,319
mentioned the evo 8 you have a couple of

616
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:21,959
the evo8 right yeah so uh before I moved

617
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:25,398
I was running um I was running three at

618
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:28,519
one time pretty much on at 8 I didn't

619
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:31,199
realize it was like 3,000 watt lights

620
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:34,639
older building power builds doing me

621
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,200
like $1,100 almost that was wild I was

622
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,840
like yeah like after took the second um

623
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,278
month cycle of running that many I got

624
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,119
to figure this out I don't think it

625
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:47,000
takes this much

626
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:49,359
light but um yeah I ended up taking away

627
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,079
some lights and keeping the same amount

628
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,798
of

629
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:55,639
plants still checking like you know the

630
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:59,679
drop off but uh I feel like it was kind

631
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:01,640
of the same result could be wrong but

632
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,840
like it was kind of the same result with

633
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,559
uh the evo8 I feel like it just really

634
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,000
good yeah that is a really good light

635
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:09,200
powerful light I don't know anybody who

636
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,759
runs it at 100% I think most people run

637
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,240
it like 80% I know some people run it

638
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:16,599
50% 60% I'm talking flowering stage too

639
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,440
and of course you can dim it down even

640
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:20,480
more for the veg stage because you

641
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,278
certainly don't need to be at 100% when

642
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,960
you're in the seedlings for example

643
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:26,200
that's what I said I was like you trying

644
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,840
to kill my plants

645
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,038
bro but it does make a huge difference

646
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:32,480
having the optimal lighting you know the

647
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:34,158
lighting that you need for that grow

648
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,960
space in your old space you had those

649
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,039
Viper spectral wands and I don't even

650
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,960
think it was completely covering the

651
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:41,759
area as it should have been right so

652
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,000
like yeah no offense to like the company

653
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,960
at all I was just they have higher level

654
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,759
lights they have better you know I just

655
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,120
was using the bare minimum I was being

656
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:54,798
cheap want to offer up like 30 40 bucks

657
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:56,398
on 150 wat light and I wanted a couple

658
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,960
of those I feel like I could stretch

659
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:03,678
them out with the space

660
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:06,759
I don't advise any new grower to

661
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,559
actually try to maximize with the

662
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:11,798
minimum I think if you're growing with

663
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:15,158
the bare minimum you

664
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:18,000
should like you know go wild with that

665
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:21,039
minimum space and minimum equipment

666
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,359
instead of like uh overdoing it I was

667
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,000
definitely overdoing it I learned a lot

668
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:26,240
from what we're doing I learned how to

669
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,720
like you know when you're doing your

670
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,519
math I learned how to show my work [ __ ]

671
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,839
up and like go back and race it not do

672
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:37,960
that but shouldn't have to go through

673
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:40,359
those things for like at that Speed most

674
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:44,440
people will just quit growing for sure

675
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:46,879
how has plant health and yields changed

676
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,640
from your old setup to your new setup oh

677
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,880
man

678
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,038
um my plants are 10 times more healthy I

679
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:58,399
haven't really seen any um I haven't

680
00:28:55,038 --> 00:29:00,240
seen many problems besides things that

681
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:03,398
either the plant is asking for or things

682
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:07,079
that I'm lacking on like uh CTIC

683
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:09,959
problems or nitrogen um I have a big

684
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:12,839
problem with adding in too much nitrogen

685
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,558
sometimes so I have I've had plants in

686
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:17,079
the um past get lock out I didn't even

687
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:19,038
know was lock out I was like oh this

688
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:21,678
plant is so pretty it's dark like this

689
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:24,640
is the darkest leaf plant ever like I

690
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,278
thought that was beautiful and I slowly

691
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,640
had to learn and like read more and

692
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:29,200
watch more and learn that that was

693
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,000
actually l out there's some plants there

694
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,759
it's dark naturally but that certain

695
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,200
color is lock out and I I didn't know

696
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:40,398
that so yeah I feel like that that was a

697
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,720
big thing for me I remember seeing your

698
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:44,678
gr room the old setup and walking in

699
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,200
there and seeing that's some struggling

700
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:48,440
plants there like you like you mentioned

701
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,000
earlier what and since then the pictures

702
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,080
you show online Instagram you can

703
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,480
clearly see a difference in there and

704
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:57,319
you know I hear a lot of people say that

705
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,679
you don't need all this equipment in

706
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:02,759
order to get healthy plants you probably

707
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,600
don't but it helps it helps out

708
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,359
tremendously having a controller that's

709
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:08,278
going to automate your environment for

710
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:10,678
example or or lighting that's going to

711
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:13,440
provide the sufficient amount of light

712
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:16,440
for the plants so maybe not having this

713
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,679
Top Line setup that you have now maybe

714
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,240
it's not a requirement but it's

715
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:22,840
certainly helpful in get in getting a

716
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,960
better result yeah having a Walmart

717
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:26,439
board versus a skateboard is not a

718
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,558
requirement you can still push down the

719
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,240
street you can uh

720
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:34,599
like I'm doing flip tricks right now

721
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:38,558
like this is way better but I don't know

722
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:40,439
I I just feel like uh if I could tell

723
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:43,359
anybody else with like a if they were to

724
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:46,480
get like a 150 watt or anything like

725
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:48,839
that get it use it but use it for veg

726
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,720
use it for germ don't even use it past a

727
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:55,119
week or two veg cuz it's not going to

728
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,360
like there's lights that'll literally

729
00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:01,158
make your PL do what it should do after

730
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:02,558
a week after the second set of leaves it

731
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:05,799
could pretty much do

732
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:07,678
it I wouldn't use anything like that for

733
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:09,638
long I think it's good I think it's good

734
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,600
for germination how about your daily

735
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:15,240
routine how has that changed having from

736
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:19,558
basically no equipment to having top of

737
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:21,519
line equipment um it's a lot more

738
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:22,278
Stressless I don't know if that's a word

739
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,960
or

740
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:28,519
term but yeah um I I hand water so

741
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:33,519
that's a a thing that I still haven't

742
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:35,079
figured out um but other than that I I

743
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,399
feel like I can leave town for a couple

744
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:39,439
days I can leave town for like 2 3 days

745
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:42,439
if especially like you know growing in

746
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,080
soil you have a

747
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,919
2day in between watering most the time

748
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,278
especially with like the medium I'm

749
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,480
using I don't have to water every single

750
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:56,159
day now that I'm in flour I might have

751
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,639
to water every other day but um yeah I

752
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:02,399
feel like growing in soil and

753
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:05,558
with the controller you hook it up to

754
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:07,518
Wi-Fi so if you go to Disneyland and you

755
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:09,759
want to go to Florida to visit your

756
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,079
family or things like that I still look

757
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:14,960
at my stuff I still see what's going on

758
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:18,918
if you have anybody in town you can have

759
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:22,000
them go do what you see going on oh this

760
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:25,000
is going on hopefully I just to do this

761
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,798
work that's huge um before I was kind of

762
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,038
just like scrambling I felt like I was

763
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:31,158
the only one that could fit any problems

764
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:33,079
I couldn't go out of town I couldn't

765
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:35,159
like there's no way like nobody knows my

766
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:37,759
problems nobody knows what can be fixed

767
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:39,720
like now it's kind of like a I don't

768
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:43,038
want to say automated cuz there's like

769
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:47,240
the new like automated system but it

770
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:48,879
helps me control myself I have like I've

771
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,558
been saying this ter a lot with my

772
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,880
friend and I talk about a girl and it's

773
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:55,720
like full control no offense to like

774
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,840
companies growing Autos or anybody that

775
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:02,558
grows Autos but I don't personally right

776
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:06,079
now because I really like full

777
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:09,558
control um I want to know how many days

778
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:12,278
of veg I can go for I if plant just

779
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:15,200
decides to do what it wants to do I want

780
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:18,440
to know how many like if uh right now I

781
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:21,480
have one gallons in my tent I want to

782
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,200
know that I have this many one gallons

783
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:28,038
the bare minimum I'm always going to put

784
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,840
the bare minimum at developing uh 28 you

785
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:35,398
know at the

786
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:37,158
lowest 28 um at the weight of each one

787
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:39,558
gallon I'm just going to you know I'm

788
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:42,360
not going to high help if I know how

789
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:45,319
many I have and I know how many that

790
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:47,599
can develop then with the auto you could

791
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:50,759
never really calculate or predict those

792
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:54,158
things with um photo periods and having

793
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:56,079
a system that is controlled that word

794
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,440
control becomes so much more like you

795
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:01,199
can control every single thing that's

796
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,278
going on even when it comes to like

797
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,960
cutting clones you kind of can control

798
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:07,679
how many days going to take the Roots

799
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,079
come out well a little bit of it is hope

800
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,119
but if you know what you're doing you

801
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:14,359
can fully control it wow but having that

802
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:16,358
controller like you mentioned where you

803
00:34:14,358 --> 00:34:19,838
can basically go into an app on your

804
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:21,679
phone and be able to not only see what

805
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:23,320
your conditions are but you can control

806
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,240
the different pieces of equipment

807
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,240
through there as well that's a game

808
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:30,439
changer yeah that's crazy I it felt the

809
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,799
same way when I went to like the AC

810
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,838
Infinity system using their App instead

811
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,599
of kind of being blind I spent so many

812
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:40,199
years without that and it is kind of

813
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:42,079
nervous leaving town because you don't

814
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:43,480
even know like you just hope that your

815
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,800
plants are going to be good to go you

816
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,240
hope that the the environment conditions

817
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,280
are going to be solid that the lighting

818
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:51,878
is going to turn on like it should and

819
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,000
turn off like it should you know so yeah

820
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:56,039
that's definitely a definitely a huge

821
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,639
game changer that's another thing I

822
00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:02,440
forgot um before you you guys came I was

823
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:06,199
having a problem with um my lighting

824
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,639
like I um was using like the old like

825
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:11,559
spin wheel

826
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:16,480
timers and you know it happens I did it

827
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:19,358
wrong I was probably high but um I uh W

828
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,960
winded back my timer to where somehow it

829
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:22,920
was a couple more hours of light than it

830
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,159
should be it didn't turn off or it cut

831
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:28,240
back on and um Lally things were

832
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:31,199
starting to reveg everything had the

833
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:34,000
three uh branded everything like every n

834
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:35,799
it was wild but I wasn't able to catch

835
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,920
that because during those times it was

836
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,280
out I wasn't going to open that door I

837
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,079
was like there's no way I don't need to

838
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,240
go in there like up but um now that I

839
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:47,480
have the controller I don't really have

840
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:49,759
to worry about that I will say if you

841
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,039
are new to the controller at all and

842
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,319
you're setting up the controller by hand

843
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:57,079
I don't think anybody should do that you

844
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:59,039
need to use the app because there's like

845
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:00,880
the left and right right button

846
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,039
sometimes will change settings that you

847
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,720
don't even

848
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:07,318
notice and your lights might cut back on

849
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:09,559
and the only way to change that is in

850
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:11,119
the app I've had that happen to two

851
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:13,000
different people I've seen on Instagram

852
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,079
and I personally messaged them and

853
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,159
they're like yo thank you like this is

854
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:20,119
wild I I didn't know that was the thing

855
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:21,399
but yeah have the control over your app

856
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:22,680
it's so much easier to set up the

857
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,800
controller I completely agree with you

858
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:27,318
on that one versus trying to do it on

859
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,480
the actual controller so looking back at

860
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:34,199
you your Evolution from a struggling

861
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,719
grow room to a high-tech operation what

862
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:39,318
advice would you have for Growers

863
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:40,799
considering a similar upgrade my

864
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:43,838
personal

865
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,280
advice is really think about what you're

866
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:48,559
growing for really think about if you

867
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:52,160
just like there's nothing wrong with

868
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:55,799
people like house plants and different

869
00:36:52,159 --> 00:37:00,000
flowers all that exists and I truly

870
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:02,318
believe that s 5% of our community are

871
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,199
men that are afraid to admit that they

872
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:07,079
want to just see something gr that's why

873
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:10,000
some people choose to grow Autos some

874
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,599
people veg for like a week some people

875
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,639
they just like to see something grow and

876
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:17,920
they don't want to they don't want to

877
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:22,000
grow no flower so I think that um I I

878
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:26,079
don't know I I I feel like we should put

879
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,119
more into growing more things than

880
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,560
just that

881
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,559
I hear you yeah getting the experience

882
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,400
with other plants can certainly be

883
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:36,639
beneficial some plants can be treated

884
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,400
the same but often times there are

885
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:41,318
little differences here and there and uh

886
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,119
yeah I went from starting growing

887
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:46,519
medicinal plants then vegetables leafy

888
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:49,240
greens I started out with peppers

889
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:51,800
tomatoes now I've got trees in my

890
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:53,919
backyard so uh I've just been kind of

891
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,359
continuing to move on and on and on and

892
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,838
learn more about the different plants

893
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:57,960
it's definitely uh definitely something

894
00:37:56,838 --> 00:37:59,880
I enjoy a lot

895
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,800
how do you do that in Vegas well there

896
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,240
are a bunch of plants that bunch of

897
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:08,119
trees that can Thrive out here things

898
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:09,879
like figs pomegranate citrus trees they

899
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:12,119
actually really Thrive out here there's

900
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:15,000
some Apple varieties I I'm looking to

901
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:17,039
get a couple of those pears so um yeah

902
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,559
it can be done out here you're naming a

903
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:23,039
lot of stuff that I expected to be such

904
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:26,559
water consumers I didn't think was

905
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:27,960
postive um have you ever met John ker

906
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:29,960
col I don't know if I'm pronounce his

907
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,440
last name right but have you met him uh

908
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:34,280
grow grow Your Greens I actually ran

909
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,039
into him that MJ biscon probably like

910
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,400
three or four years ago now yes so I had

911
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:41,599
a conversation with him in person nice

912
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,880
guy that dude's cool that D's super good

913
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,519
so we have quite a few folks here that

914
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,200
are looking for genetics they're

915
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:48,838
shopping for genetics and they don't

916
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,439
really know what to get so I've been

917
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:52,799
asking folks that have been coming on

918
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,720
the podcast recently what genetics do

919
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,720
you like can you name maybe the top

920
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,759
three strains that you've grown and what

921
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:04,519
you've liked about them

922
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:07,200
top top three I would say um two I'm

923
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:10,239
going to feel in pretty quick just

924
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:13,719
because they were the first things I

925
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:17,000
grew that I was like wow this is this is

926
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:19,279
what is a difference you know I didn't

927
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,400
um give them the due diligence they

928
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,880
probably should have got but exotic

929
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,200
genetics and soire those are great I

930
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,800
really believe that like if you're

931
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:30,519
trying to get into growing like Exotics

932
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,000
or different things like different

933
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:35,880
flavor profiles then that's somebody you

934
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,719
should go to if you're looking into

935
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,920
breeding or if you're looking into

936
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:44,639
growing um different things that wasn't

937
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,159
like aren't exactly in the rules of what

938
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:49,318
like uh the way things should

939
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:51,358
go but you're looking for something

940
00:39:49,318 --> 00:39:52,960
crazy that nobody is going to have I

941
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:57,559
think people should go through Masonic

942
00:39:52,960 --> 00:40:01,000
that's my top three um Masonic smoker um

943
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:04,400
um the genetics and sire those are three

944
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,880
good Masonic is so reasonable on price

945
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:11,119
sometimes like $10 $25 for like

946
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,920
sometimes 40 beans and um the other two

947
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,960
they're a little pricey but I still

948
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,400
think all three years Super worth it

949
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,079
awesome all right well I appreciate you

950
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,400
sharing that information with us let's

951
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,800
wrap things up here can you tell

952

00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,920
right now I'm you know kind of writing

959
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,358
down the pre scripts or like pre

960
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:48,440
questions and reaching out to people I

961
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:50,400
feel like would fit best for my podcast

962
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,119
which is going to have to do with the

963
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,880
flower we all love and

964
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,119
um being paranoid you know being

965
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,599
paranoid and and different things like

966
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:01,838
that and people automatically like a lot

967
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,760
of people I reach out to they were like

968
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:06,000
what are you talking about you're going

969
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:08,079
to talk about um like being paranoid

970
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,440
things like that it's not going to be

971
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,800
necessarily what people are thinking

972
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,159
we're not going to talk about sometimes

973
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,720
we might talk about like Al or UFOs

974
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:17,480
things like that but I want to talk

975
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:20,078
about the paranoia and the plant we love

976
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:23,119
bringing a bag of soil home and you

977
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,599
might get something we all don't want

978
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,480
you know what I'm saying or like uh

979
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,720
really diving into become and a tester

980
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,519
for somebody that you're really

981
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:35,000
represented and something goes wrong

982
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:38,759
like there's so many things that can

983
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,318
happen that I feel like are vague and

984
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,680
people should talk about as we know what

985
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:45,119
he talks about and um there's ways to

986
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:47,358
talk about it without disrespect of

987
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,720

988
