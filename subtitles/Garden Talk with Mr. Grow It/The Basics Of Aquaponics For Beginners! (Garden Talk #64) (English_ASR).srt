1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,000
coming up on garden talk

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,960
and their waste is then broken down and

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,879
mineralized into a plant food that is

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,879
then the hyper bio available to the

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,400
plants so we can run much lower parts

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,839
per million in terms of individual

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,440
nutrient ranges

8
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:16,800
and get the same kind of growth results

9
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:18,480
because it's hyper available in the

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,640
ranges that the plants need

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,160
the more fungi and mycorrhizae fungi you

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,240
have increases lignin production in the

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,000
plant so the woodier parts of the plant

14
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,919
also improves terpene expression of

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,079
terpene variety as well

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,399
4x4 with larger plants i would say at

17
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,799
least a 75 or 90 gallon aquarium you

18
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,558
could get by with as low as a 55

19
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,839
aquarium as long as it was super heavily

20
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,159
stocked

21
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,920
the more we learn about the soil food

22
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,759
web and you know the the different food

23
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,600
webs of our planet the more we're

24
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:48,960
improving our food safety and improving

25
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,960
plant production at the same time

26
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,359
what's up everybody if you that don't

27

potentponics he is an expert in

32
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,919
aquaponics and that's what we're going

33

49
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,118
grow tent which has a canvas density of

50
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,118
2000 d making them the thickest grow

51
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,478
tent on the market today it has an

52
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,319
aluminum plate that mounts your

53
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,078
controller to the grow tent with the

54
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,118
light proof pass-through for cable

55
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,438
routing the frame has 50 thicker steel

56
00:01:55,118 --> 00:02:00,000
poles and carries two times more weight

57
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,919
than the standard grow tents coupon code

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,680
mr growit will get you a discount on

59
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,600

section below

62
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,639
and we are back welcome to the garden

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,560
talk podcast today i am joined with

64
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,839
steve from potentponics how you doing

65
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,759
today

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,200
hey how's it going thanks for having me

67
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,639
thanks for coming on we're going to

68
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,639
learn all about aquaponics today so uh

69
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,919
you have an extensive knowledge when it

70
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:30,159
comes to aquaponics i myself don't have

71
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,479
any experience with it so i think this

72
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,159
is going to be a pretty interesting talk

73
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,479
here because i'm going to be able to

74
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,639
pick your brain as somebody with very

75
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,560
little knowledge of it so

76
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,479
i hope you're prepared for this i think

77
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,080
this is going to help folks not only

78
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,000
doing aquaponics

79
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,959
but there is a section that we're going

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,479
to really get deep into ph

81
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,080
and so for those folks that aren't

82
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,238
growing on aquaponics maybe you're in

83
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,400
soil or cocoa or

84
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,640
even a hydroponic system if this

85
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,560
aquaponics talk doesn't really

86
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,679
appeal to you much you might just want

87
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,920
to skip over to the ph section at least

88
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,879
listen to the ph section because you'll

89
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,799
definitely be able to have some

90
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,799
takeaways on that avenue but first

91
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,319
before we get too deep into things let's

92
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,519
do an introduction can you tell us a

93
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,598
little bit about yourself and kind of

94
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,000
how you got into gardening sure so uh my

95
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,799
name is steven reisner razner

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,598
i'm the owner of potentponics which is a

97
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,040
aquaponics consulting company we help

98
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,039
with everything from lettuce to

99
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,079
medicinal plants to trees to everything

100
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,318
in between

101
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,440
and

102
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:32,798
yeah i've been working in the industry

103
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,959
for a long time so i originally got

104
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,040
started farming and gardening with my

105
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,080
grandparents for the two acre farm and

106
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,400
we used to

107
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,480
you know they grew up pre-depression era

108
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,920
so we used to make our own pesticides

109
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,679
from fermented tomato leaves and make

110
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,359
her own cloning gel from willow shoots

111
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,640
and all of her own you know basically

112
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,840
make all of our own stuff which was

113
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,598
super cool

114
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,519
and then later on moved into the moral

115
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,518
commercial side of things uh

116
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,680
getting into certain medicinal plants

117
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,158
and then into um

118
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,719
vegetable and other production as well

119
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,000
and um and then later on i worked in uh

120
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,560
out in colorado and some of the

121
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,519
medicinal plant industries

122
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,438
and then um switched over to working uh

123
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,280
in my own company and i've now worked

124
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,000
around the world in africa and south

125
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,839
america and

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,439
across the caribbean across the united

127
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,119
states canada

128
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,439
all over uh helping build different

129
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,879
types of aquaponics facilities or

130
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,319
helping people especially with specialty

131
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,879
crops we did a lot of work with fruit

132
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,959
trees and some other heavy feeding crops

133
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,439
to try and dial that in and

134
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,680
that's been uh i guess a lot of my work

135
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:38,719
i guess is a short version of it on i

136
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,240
originally started working in the pet

137
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,240
trade and then there's a lot of overlap

138
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,930
with the pet trade and

139
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,280
certain types of plants that you grow

140
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,720
[Laughter]

141
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,719
that we all like to enjoy for

142
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,360
recreational purposes

143
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,360
and then um

144
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,478
eventually from there got into

145
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,319
aquaponics we used to call them river

146
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,680
tanks before there was the word

147
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,959
aquaponics

148
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,038
and then

149
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,560
started working out in colorado and then

150
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,319
the floods happened out there and then

151
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,439
ended up getting a job at the aquaponics

152
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,879
source

153
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,199
in their research laboratory and all

154
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,680
that stuff so that was a a really great

155
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,360
um a time managing that and doing all

156
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,879
the different research work there in

157
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,680
their lab

158
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,719
and then from there they switched owners

159
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,720
and we had to um

160
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,160
they were interested in having some of

161
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,639
the different sectors of the company

162
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,560
that i was heading up research-wise

163
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,478
and from there i started my own company

164
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,399
and i've been doing that for

165
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,240
gosh i guess seven years now which is

166
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,198
kind of hard hard to believe for me to

167
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,680
say

168
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,680
that's incredible so lots of experience

169
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,160
so your overall style of gardening i

170
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,360
mean you talked about aquaponics

171
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,280
are you

172
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,080
are only indoors or do you also do

173
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:50,879
outdoor growing um have you done soil

174
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,959
cocoa any like dwc

175
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,719
are you organic or synthetic

176
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,478
sure so i've grown pretty much every way

177
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,560
you can think of i've grown aeroponics

178
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,560
dwc media bed wicking bed

179
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,720
sips whatever you want to call it these

180
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:04,719
days

181
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,759
rafts beds vertical beds

182
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,758
um my my personal favorite is dual root

183
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,520
zones so i'm a big fan of splitting up

184
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,080
the pots and having the top half of the

185
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,439
pot with a layer of soil separated with

186
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,879
a layer of burlap or other root

187
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,959
permeable media

188
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,839
to keep the soil above it and then below

189
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:26,638
that a medium immediate so like a clay

190
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,638
lekka or a hydrotin or

191
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,240
a lava rock

192
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,680
and this allows you to flood and drain

193
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,199
the bottom portion of the pot you know

194
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,560
the bottom 40 or so 45 or so of the pot

195
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,639
and 50 of the pot put a layer of burlap

196
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,560
and the top half be soil and this allows

197
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,160
you to top feed the soil

198
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,360
you can amend that you can make a super

199
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,680
soil mix

200
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,598
and have a nice living soil that has you

201
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,360
know companion plants and

202
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,199
the mycorrhizae and other microbes that

203
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,280
come along with that and diversifying

204
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,400
the microbial species in the upper

205
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,559
portion of the root zone and then all

206
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,799
the aquatic fauna and the bottom portion

207
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,598
of the root zone which is also a huge

208
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,360
factor in um the health of a typical um

209
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,000
uh uh plant you know that the biggest

210
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,840
way to increase the plant's biodiversity

211
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,319
of its roots or website the biggest way

212
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,159
to improve the plants um immune system

213
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,199
is to increase its biodiversity in the

214
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,680
root system so so lots of experience in

215
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,240
several different areas when it comes to

216
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,680
gardening so that's pretty cool

217
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,240
so let's dive deeper into aquaponics so

218
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,519
you know just starting for beginners

219
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,680
tell us what exactly is aquaponics

220
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,839
sure so aquaponics is growing basically

221
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,840
with the organic hydroponics i guess is

222
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,159
the simple form of it but think think of

223
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,478
it but more like aquatic soil

224
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,120
is how i prefer to describe it so um you

225
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,639
have uh the the fish which are in living

226
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,000
in the system so imagine a hydroponic

227
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,400
system that has fish living in the

228
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,079
reservoir and their waste is then broken

229
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:58,560
down and mineralized into a plant food

230
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,719
uh that is then

231
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,800
um

232
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,800
hyper bioavailable to the plants so we

233
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,038
can run much lower parts per million in

234
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,639
terms of individual nutrient ranges

235
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,079
and get the same kind of growth results

236
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,759
because it's hyper available in the

237
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,079
range that the plants need and that

238
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,038
makes a huge difference in

239
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,918
how how well that works for the plants

240
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,079
and then

241
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,799
we have a huge microbial biodiversity in

242
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,639
that so basically the the fish poops we

243
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,400
take that poop we mineralize it the same

244
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,400
way they would composting

245
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,318
i guess in soil would be a good

246
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,240
equivalent and then converting it into

247
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,158
liquid

248
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,759
aquatic soil which is the hyper

249
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,439
mineralized water that's recirculating

250
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,479
all the time for the plants

251
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,919
okay so basically kind of taking a step

252
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,599
back you've got

253
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,000
sort of like a fish tank but are the

254
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,160
roots is it similar to like dwc where

255
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,080
the roots are actually in the same tank

256
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,600
as the fish or do you have a separate

257
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,360
tank for it

258
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,959
sure so in general we usually keep the

259
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,240
fish away from the plants there's a lot

260
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,000
of fish that'll actually eat the roots

261
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,680
of the plants koi in particular love and

262
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,799
tilapia both will feed on the roots of

263
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,479
the plants

264
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,599
so unless you have a particular reason

265
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,639
for that

266
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,639
it is something that you want to

267
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,399
avoid um so generally we have a separate

268
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,159
fish tank that flows into an essential

269
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,559
sump that is then going to both the grow

270
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:17,039
bed and the fish tank uh plumbing-wise

271
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,559
okay let's get deeper into

272
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,399
like the actual equipment that's

273
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,399
required for this

274
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,200
you can do this on a home grow level as

275
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,440
well as a commercial skill right so

276
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,560
i think most of my audience is home

277
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,800
growers

278
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,119
so i i would like to narrow it down to

279
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,479
just talking about homegrown however

280
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,879
you know if you feel like there is some

281
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,399
information there that is applicable and

282
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,360
it you know overlaps with the commercial

283
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,600
side of things when it comes to

284
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,200
aquaponics feel free to to talk about

285
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,000
that as well but

286
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,000
if you are a home grower and you're

287
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,799
ready to start aquaponics

288
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,278
what equipment is required in order to

289
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,958
get going sure so um if you already have

290
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,039
an aquarium at home if you have a

291
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,278
aquarium with a wet dry all you really

292
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,199
need to do is get a second overflow box

293
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,278
from your uh um

294
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,440
uh for your aquarium and then hang that

295
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:06,559
on to the side of your over um flood and

296
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,000
drain bed

297
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,439
and then you can have a flow through

298
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,919
that way is a simple way to do it or you

299
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,240
can use a bell siphon as your return or

300
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,838
a loop siphon is another simple way that

301
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,720
in low cost way

302
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,720
to flood and drain a grow bed

303
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,079
and that doesn't fail you know you don't

304
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,839
need a timer or anything that's going to

305
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,679
fail on you

306
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,079
and those can be great you know super

307
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,078
low uh cost ways especially loop siphons

308
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,359
cost you know the cost of a piece of

309
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,199
tubing that's

310
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,120
you know three feet long like it is it's

311
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,959
not expensive at all to do

312
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,799
and then run that back to essential wet

313
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,919
dry sump that like you typically use for

314
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,078
an aquarium

315
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,919
and then just pump from there uh to

316
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,359
wherever or you know get a tough tote

317
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:46,799
see if you have a you don't have any of

318
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,759
that you can go to your local aquarium

319
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:49,759
store

320
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,039
you can go get an overflow box for your

321
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,200
aquarium

322
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,159
you can get a tough tote uses your sump

323
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,680
at home depot for like 15 bucks

324
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,600
and then you could go over and get a

325
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,599
plump fun drain kit from your local

326
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,000
hydro store for like another

327
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,000
you know 25 30 bucks

328
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,759
uh hook it all up to a central pump with

329
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
a tee so the part of it goes to the fish

330
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,200
tank part of it goes to the grow bed uh

331
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,639
you know make sure you have valves to

332
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,839
adjust the flow rate so you can get it

333
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,919
all set right

334
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,000
and dialed in and then you know away you

335
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,439
go it's not anything overly complicated

336
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,278
you can easily plumb them into an

337
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,720
existing grow tent and aquarium you have

338
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,320
at your house already

339
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,720
it's nothing you know particularly

340
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,120
complicated at all i would suggest going

341
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,959
with loop siphons or bell siphons over

342
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,240
uh timer based systems timer-based

343
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,879
systems if you're familiar with them

344
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,278
that's fine but the the timers always

345
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,639
fail before the pumps fail so you know

346
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:39,919
it can kill your plants it's not

347
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,559
something you want to do

348
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:45,278
okay so i'm imagining the

349
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,319
fish tank right and i'm imagining

350
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,559
another

351
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,399
box really where you're

352
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:53,278
or another container

353
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,039
where the actual plant is located right

354
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:58,480
and you said it's similar to a sense

355
00:11:55,039 --> 00:12:00,719
where i mean using like net pots and

356
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,879
hydroton or anything up top and then the

357
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,040
roots are kind of suspended into the the

358
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,679
lower section where the water is are

359
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:10,159
there any like air stones down in that

360
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,838
section or is it all just kind of

361
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:15,360
connected through and the flow

362
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,440
auctioning oxygenate the the water there

363
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,000
so you can do a dual root zone uh i'm

364
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,760
sorry a dwc and you can just put pots

365
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,440
with uh you know a screen on the bottom

366
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,600
of them let the roots go through that

367
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,040
works really well um we've had quite a

368
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,959
few people doing that or even just a

369
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,399
burlap on the bottom of a pot with some

370
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,799
holes cut in the bottom to allow it to

371
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,839
grow through works really well

372
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,039
um

373
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,959
the other way to do if you have an

374
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,799
existing dwc otherwise just do a flood

375
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:43,359
and drain in a regular flood and drain

376
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:45,199
bed um or you know a drip bed it's just

377
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,879
fine you know and you can use with or

378
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,480
without media on the bottom part of the

379
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,320
the tray as long as you have it in your

380
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,320
pots which only use five gallon pots or

381
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,278
three gallon pots depending on plant

382
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,200
size with the bottom half hydrogen

383
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:00,078
or lava rock with burlap and in the

384
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,000
middle and then the top half soil okay

385
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,479
so there are several different ways to

386
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,639
kind of set up your equipment

387
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,639
and be successful several different

388
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,720
techniques on doing that the thing that

389
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,959
helps the most is having that extra soil

390
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,959
layer even in the aquatic one um

391
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,679
type setups is because it increases the

392
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,359
lignin production uh the more fungi and

393
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:20,879
mycorrhizae fungi you have increases

394
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,039
lignin production in the plant so the

395
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,120
woodier parts of the plant also improves

396
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,078
terpene expression of terpene variety as

397
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,959
well

398
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:31,679
interesting now i got to imagine that

399
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,759
it would probably be best to

400
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,958
have a fish tank first and like learn

401
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,679
how to

402
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,679
feed fish and have them survive before

403
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,519
you take before you take the next step

404
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,919
and hook up your plants to that system

405
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,759
is that right should you at least have

406
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,599
basic knowledge on

407
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,439
you know how to manage a fish tank i

408
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,519
know there's a lot of components to that

409
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,040
in itself right you're definitely better

410
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,120
off um

411
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,039
having uh

412
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,039
at least a knowledge of how an aquarium

413
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,559
cycles with the nitrogen cycling and

414
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,799
going from you know from ammonia to

415
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,559
nitrite to nitrate with the colonization

416
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,479
of the various bacteria

417
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,239
that help facilitate that but your other

418
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,560
minerals also work on that same way so

419
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,240
yeah you want to have at least uh

420
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,838
not have your first aquarium be your

421
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,320
aquaponics system if you can help it but

422
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,279
if it is and that's okay you know um i

423
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,879
wouldn't say that's something that

424
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,559
you're you're gonna

425
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,679
you know fail at if you've never worked

426
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,359
on an aquarium before but you're

427
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,759
certainly gonna be better off you know

428
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,159
having an aquarium and understanding how

429
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,240
that works before getting into

430
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,439
hybridized systems i think it certainly

431
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,360
can make the learning curve a little

432
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,199
easier but it's definitely nothing that

433
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,639
you couldn't learn all at once uh you

434
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:37,919
know if you wanted to

435
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,480
all right and then how do you make this

436
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,479
work in a grow tent i know it's possible

437
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,639
we like i mentioned a lot of my viewers

438
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,800
are just home growers

439
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,519
so making this work in a grow tent would

440
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,198
the actual aquarium kind of be in the

441
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,799
grow tent with it or would you recommend

442
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,559
it to be kind of outside the grow tent

443
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,639
then tubing coming into the grow tent

444
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,879
with the plants or how would that kind

445
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,560
of all work within a grow tent sure yeah

446
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:02,320
so you would just put sit your aquarium

447
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,638
next to your grow tent and run the

448
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,639
tubing into there maybe put the sump uh

449
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,079
in the in the uh

450
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,600
in the grow tent or you could even put

451
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:10,958
the sump outside of the grid tent if you

452
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,560
want to but make sure you have your grow

453
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,399
beds in the

454
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,679
in the grow tent obviously uh with the

455
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,440
plumbing right they're running in there

456
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,958
and having the sump and grow bed in

457
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,560
there or having the sump outside of it

458
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,679
and having the plumbing go in and back

459
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,278
out of the tent

460
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,759
depending on what's going to make more

461
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,958
sense for your your spot but the easiest

462
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,759
way would just be to throw the tough

463
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,359
tote in there set a short you know table

464
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,680
in there or something to to keep you

465
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,360
know your grow bed height set your grow

466
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,198
beds on there like two concrete mixing

467
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,360
trays or standard three by three grow

468
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,359
bed and then um

469
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,480
put your plumbing off off of there so

470
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,079
either your

471
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,079
stand pipe for your flood and drain or

472
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,198
for your um

473
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,638
uh

474
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,078
loop siphon or your belt siphon

475
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,399
depending on what type of setup you

476
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:55,359
decide to go with and so say say they're

477
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,000
in a 4x4 tent and they want to run four

478
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,480
plants in there what size

479
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,039
aquarium tank should they

480
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,600
get for that does it need to be

481
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,278
like i know some systems out there like

482
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,360
auto watering systems for example like

483
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,759
gravity fed to where you have to have it

484
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,839
above where the plants are are there any

485
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,519
setups to where that has to be the case

486
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,040
or can really it be kind of on the

487
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,039
ground and then you've got a pump kind

488
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,879
of flowing everything through sure so

489
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,519
yeah as long as both the grow bed and

490
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,278
the fish tank are above the sump tank

491
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,120
you can it doesn't really matter with a

492
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,120
grow bed to fish tank levels you're not

493
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,560
flowing directly from the grow fish tank

494
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,560
to the grow bed in most setups so

495
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,399
you can set plum it that way and it will

496
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,159
work but i wouldn't recommend it i think

497
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,839
you're far better off

498
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,919
having them from a central tee that

499
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,279
comes from the central feed spot so that

500
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,000
you have better you know kind of

501
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,120
basically two loops uh going around one

502
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,679
for the fish tank and one for the

503
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,078
growbed works much more efficiently

504
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,919
and then what size tank for the fish

505
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,838
sure so i would go for

506
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,879
four by four with larger plants i would

507
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,440
say at least a 75 or 90 gallon aquarium

508
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,198
you could get by with as low as a 55

509
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,279
aquarium as long as it was super heavily

510
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,519
stocked but you know you're really kind

511
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,838
of pushing the lower limits of the

512
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:13,038
you know there's not enough fish weight

513
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,639
to make enough biomass and fish poop to

514
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,318
feed the plants at that point you know i

515
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,199
mean there's a kind of a minimum level

516
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:18,399
of

517
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,000
of uh

518
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,880
fish biomass that you need to have to

519
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,119
feed the plants in the actual aquarium

520
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,760
you know 75 gallon you've got the fish

521
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,839
in there what else is in that tank

522
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,440
sure so we often will put the fish and

523
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,279
then using an algae eater or two just to

524
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,960
keep the thing clean

525
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,359
and then we'll have the the drain in the

526
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,440
drain cover i know whatever it is to

527
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,399
keep them from getting sucked in

528
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,759
and then

529
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,440
that's all we ever have in there well

530
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,038
maybe some air stones

531
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,960
or a heater sometimes depending on the

532
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:48,558
size of the the fish tank i was going to

533
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,960
ask i know we're getting kind of deep

534
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,960
into like managing an aquarium but it

535
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,120
does wrap into it is there like a

536
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,120
certain water temperature that needs to

537
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,479
be there for the the fish we'll get

538
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,639
deeper into like different species of

539
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,079
fish here in a few minutes but like

540
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,919
water temp

541
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,639
does is there any lighting that needs to

542
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,240
happen over that aquarium tank or what

543
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,799
sure so as far as water temperature

544
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,480
generally 68 to 72 is where most of our

545
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,558
facilities are running at

546
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,400
for optimal fish growth and plant growth

547
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:17,759
uh and that seems to work really well

548
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,519
across the board you know if you're

549
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,359
going for cooler weather crops you could

550
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,200
always go with a little bit cooler water

551
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,319
uh or you know in the summertime if

552
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,798
you're in an area where it's going to be

553
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,960
really hard to cool that water

554
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,720
you could always go with like uh mizuna

555
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,640
or some of the other um

556
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,400
um uh

557
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,720
warm weather crops that aren't gonna

558
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,559
care so much yeah okra be another one

559
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,279
that really doesn't care about heat

560
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,798
gotcha and then the water that goes into

561
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,480
the tank

562
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:45,200
we talked yesterday where i was actually

563
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,919
on

564
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,840
steve's podcast yesterday and we kind of

565
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,080
talked a little bit about this

566
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,079
fresh water versus salt water i know

567
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:55,599
it's a noob question right but we want

568
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,519
to cover it here

569
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:59,439
so does fresh water go in there or are

570
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,440
there some aquaponics setups that have

571
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,759
salt water in there sure so there's

572
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,919
definitely ways that you can profit off

573
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:10,960
of plants with salt water

574
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,960
in aquaponics but it doesn't work for

575
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,960
doing anything as far as

576
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,400
terrestrial plants are concerned outside

577
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,400
of brassicas there aren't too many

578
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,798
plants that will grow in a brackish or

579
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,798
salt waters type setting mangrove trees

580
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:24,639
if you're doing a mangrove tree

581
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:27,359
rehabilitation program maybe that would

582
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,759
work but uh outside of that there isn't

583
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,359
uh agent but use much usage for salt

584
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,200
water everything else is fresh water

585
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,879
that we work with

586
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,720
there are people that do like abalone

587
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,480
and urchins and kelp and stuff like that

588
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,519
in aquaponic systems but

589
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,759
you know that's

590
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,679
that's more aquaculture to me i think

591
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,759
and then species of fish are there

592
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,919
certain fish that kind of work better

593
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,798
than other fish are there some fish that

594
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,400
you should avoid sure so i would avoid

595
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:56,079
anything particularly delicate you know

596
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,160
don't do discus or angelfish or you know

597
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,000
freshwater stingrays you know they're

598
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,240
they're freshwater shrimps and stuff

599
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,319
they're just too sensitive

600
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,120
and as far as fish you can use koi

601
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:09,519
tilapia yellow perch bluegill

602
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:11,678
um all the any of the panfish are all

603
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,519
good uh stuff for that

604
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,519
and then uh you know you can do larger

605
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,918
tropical fish oscars and red-tailed

606
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,200
catfish things like that also work

607
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,600
so for that

608
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,038
gallon tank example for the home grower

609
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,639
who has his tank

610
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,720
how many fish

611
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,120
should he put in that tank to begin he

612
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,440
or she i should say sure so you could do

613
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:34,158
like some larger freshwater south

614
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,159
american cichlids you could do you know

615
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,520
a crap ton of guppies or mollies if you

616
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,559
wanted to

617
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,558
you could do a

618
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,038
couple of oscars or some paku or

619
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:47,038
you know

620
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,038
yeah i think that'd be a good route

621
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,558
again you want to make sure you're still

622
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:53,919
housing the fish comfortably but you're

623
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,000
trying to get as much as you can in

624
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,200
there and it's not so much an issue with

625
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,880
a lot of people be like oh well that's

626
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,640
too many fish for the aquarium well you

627
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,480
have to remember that we have this huge

628
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,640
amount of nitrogen export you know in an

629
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,400
aquarium that's just sitting on the wall

630
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,280
there's nothing to export that nitrogen

631
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,798
right but in the um with our aquaponics

632
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:12,399
systems you have all these plants that

633
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,240
are just sucking in all the nitrogen and

634
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,840
all the waste from the fish so you don't

635
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,759
have that kind of chemical imbalance

636
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,359
that people kind of associate with

637
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,119
smaller aquariums so you can push the

638
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,759
limits quite a bit more than you're

639
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,519
typically told you can with an aquarium

640
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,759
is there a way that you can kind of tell

641
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:30,079
are there signals to know like okay i

642
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,119
have too many fish in this tank sure so

643
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,798
i would just say if there's a high

644
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,199
amount of aggression in the plant and

645
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:38,079
the in the fish

646
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,000
and then if there's a

647
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:41,839
large amount of issues with

648
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,440
high nitrates or nitrites that's going

649
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,918
to be another one that's

650
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,320
definitely going to cause issues

651
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,320
and then

652
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,359
you know again just general cleanliness

653
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,759
of the tank and the system you know if

654
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,359
it's uh really gunked up obviously you

655
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:58,640
have too much but you're gonna see that

656
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,000
in your water chemistry you know if

657
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,600
you're not again your nitrates are too

658
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,279
high you know you definitely probably if

659
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,959
your ammonia is too high you know

660
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:06,158
ammonia too high would be anything above

661
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,679
0.25

662
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,520
nitrates would be anything above about

663
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,519
40 or 50 parts per million you know it

664
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,079
would be too high how do you measure

665
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,079
that sure so you can get an aquarium

666
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,599
test kit at any pet store a lot of

667
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:18,879
places will test your water for free if

668
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:20,959
you just bring them some water samples

669
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,840
tell us it's your aquarium

670
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,079
they'll happily test it for you for free

671
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:28,240
so you know yeah and those test kits you

672
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,720
know the api test kit you can get from

673
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,919
aquarium pharmaceuticals uh it's been

674
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,159
around for

675
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,640
you know since the 80s

676
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,679
it's a really reliable test kit and as

677
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,880
long as you don't get them too hot or

678
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,038
too cold they'll give you accurate

679
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,640
readings it's a tortation test so you

680
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,640
have to put so many drops of one and so

681
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,240
many drops of the other in the vial but

682
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,440
it's super simple anyone can do it if

683
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,120
you have color now this is an

684
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,279
interesting thing if you do have color

685
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:54,959
blindness issues um be sure to um

686
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,879
uh you know looking as a company called

687
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,880
hannah and remote both of those

688
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,799
companies make digital monitors and

689
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,320
digital meters that allow for digital

690
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:04,158
output so you don't have to read a color

691
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:05,759
wheel or color comparison

692
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,640
because you know a lot of people are do

693
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:11,440
have color issues okay before we get

694
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,440
into ph i want to dive deeper into that

695
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,880
i want to know about

696
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,279
controlling the water temperature a

697
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,280
little bit more if the temperature is

698
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,480
too cool what do you do if the

699
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:24,558
temperature is too warm what do you do

700
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,319
sure so if the temperature is too cold

701
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:28,720
um we usually fire up a heater we

702
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:30,399
usually use closed loop gas heaters or

703
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,159
closed loop solar heaters so we'll take

704
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,159
solar water heaters and put them on a

705
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,240
closed loop heat exchanger and heat the

706
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,320
water that way and then we'll supplement

707
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,159
that when the weather is bad with a

708
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,839
closed loop basically tankless water

709
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,440
heater on that same heat exchanger with

710
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,879
a different you know input loop on the

711
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,558
glycol

712
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,720
and that's the how we manage on larger

713
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,639
systems on smaller systems you just use

714
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,360
a regular you know aquarium heater or

715
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,278
titanium heater depending on the size of

716
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,119
your your system

717
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:58,880
and then what about cooling

718
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,759
and then as far as a

719
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,840
cooling that's a harder problem

720
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,679
so usually when we have big facilities

721
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:08,158
we'll put coils in the ground so we'll

722
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,640
take big big metal coils that you like

723
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,480
use for gas lines the pecs the yellow

724
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,919
pex line we take the plastic off of that

725
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,079
and bury it in big giant loops

726
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,400
and then we run glycol through that

727
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:22,720
underground or ideally if they have a

728
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,480
farm pond or other pond we'll sink it to

729
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,079
the deepest part of the pond we can

730
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,440
actually get significantly better heat

731
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,278
exchange

732
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,600
it just depends on

733
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:33,278
what we have available to work with but

734
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:34,959
generally geothermal cooling is their

735
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:36,319
first resort and then

736
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,159
if that doesn't work you can go to

737
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,240
chillers but they're generally not

738
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,080
financially viable we usually try to

739
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,319
keep the room cooler and so we'll have

740
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:47,038
either ac or

741
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:49,439
again geothermal cooling with the tubing

742
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,558
in the ground on bigger facilities uh to

743
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,880
cool them down and then i get on a

744
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:55,200
smaller stuff you can always get a

745
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,640
chiller if you wanted to but um

746
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,720
generally you try to prevent it in other

747
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,799
ways preventing open sun on the water

748
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,600
and the grow beds as much as possible

749
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,720
with plant canopy or shading cloth or

750
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:06,079
you know some of the other things that

751
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,679
you can do

752
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:08,720
to try and help prevent some of those

753
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,919
issues

754
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,919
um

755
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,880
you know their cooling is a much harder

756
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,159
problem

757
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,760
there's definitely some good advice

758
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,360
there though on how to control the water

759
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:21,839
temperature

760
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:23,359
now ph what is the ideal ph range for

761
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,119
aquaponics

762
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:28,000
sure so the ideal ph range for

763
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,599
aquaponics generally is around 6.6

764
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,798
um you know that's where you're gonna

765
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:33,599
get the most amount of mineral

766
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:36,158
bioavailability uh for your system uh

767
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,839
anything you know above about seven

768
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,120
you're gonna start to see a cut off and

769
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:43,199
reduction and anything below about 6.2

770
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,879
6.0 you start to see another reduction

771
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,519
and then there is another peak lower on

772
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,039
it like 5.7 5.8 but

773
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,480
it's not

774
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:51,599
not as good across the board for what

775
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,599
we're doing and then with all the

776
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:54,959
microbial species and everything else

777
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:57,359
it's much better for us to maintain a

778
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,798
6.8 to 6.6

779
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,479
range for most of the systems that we're

780
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,558
operating right now and then when you

781
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,720
need to adjust the ph

782
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:07,278
because it goes out of range what are

783
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,919
you typically using to adjust the ph

784
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:12,720
sure so for uh aquaponics we use

785
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,559
potassium silicate and we alternate that

786
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,079
with a powdered calcium carbonate and

787
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:17,519
that works really well for raising the

788
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:20,079
ph

789
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,879
we can also use calcium chloride if we

790
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,558
had to uh if you're in hydro uh

791
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,120
hydroponics you can

792
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:29,119
um in a pinch you can also use um

793
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:32,158
you know

794
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,679
a bunch of other things to raise ph but

795
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,919
generally like potassium silicate and

796
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,519
calcium carbonate is the the main go to

797
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,120
every once in a while we use potassium

798
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,200
bicarbonate we need to also raise the

799
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,519
alkalinity or the dissolved carbonate

800
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,919
hardness um to stabilize the ph a little

801
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,440
bit more we'll add that but in general

802
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,400
that's what we use for a ph up and then

803
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,200
for ph down um we'll use phosphoric acid

804
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,640
for smaller adjustments um and we also

805
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,519
need to add some phosphorus to the

806
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,880
system

807
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,038
and then for bigger adjustments we'll

808
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,960
just use muriatic acid also called

809
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,079
hydrochloric acid which sounds a little

810
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,679
crazy but

811
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,359
it's fine when you're diluting it out

812
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,759
into thousands of gallons

813
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:10,719
i should ask this before i asked

814
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:12,319
how to adjust the phs is and you touched

815
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,798
on this a little bit i believe is what

816
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:16,798
would cause the ph to go outside of that

817
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:19,839
range is there something with that the

818
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:22,798
fish is doing that would cause it to go

819
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:24,079
too high or too low sure so um there's a

820
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,319
couple of different things so if your

821
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,839
tap water or your base water when you're

822
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,319
adding and topping off the system is

823
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,839
high in ph that can raise ph over time

824
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:32,879
by building up your mineral levels in

825
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,278
the system and building up the

826
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,200
alkalinity in the system

827
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,079
so that can be one source another source

828
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,960
would be

829
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,720
um you have um if your system is goes

830
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,798
anaerobic so so you're feeding the fish

831
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,480
too much and there's lots of fish waste

832
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,158
getting past your filtration and into

833
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,480
the beds and it's kind of clogging

834
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,799
things up and starting to rot that can

835
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,798
also start to raise the alkalinity and

836
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:57,200
raise the ph of the water

837
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,679
and that can be another sign of you know

838
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,759
why your water quality is going south

839
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,759
or another thing and this happens i see

840
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:06,480
this quite heavily in colorado i think

841
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,000
it's the place i've seen it most extreme

842
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,640
is that you can have issues when the

843
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,919
water department switches reservoirs

844
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,640
so the springtime or the fall or when

845
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,480
frost hits or whatever they'll switch

846
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,240
from one lake to another or one

847
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,038
reservoir to another and you can have as

848
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,038
much as a full ph point difference in 24

849
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,720
hours from your tap water which can be a

850
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,640
huge problem

851
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,120
if you're trying to work with anything

852
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,880
in an aquaculture or

853
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,959
even terrestrial plants

854
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,919
even when you're in soil or cocoa having

855
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,079
those large ph swings i mean that's

856
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,360
destroying your micro life right that's

857
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:43,918
something that people don't talk about

858
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,759
very often is these these large ph

859
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,640
swings and how much damage it's actually

860
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,398
doing to the the microbial life so i'm

861
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,240
glad you you mentioned that one going

862
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:53,759
back to the ph up

863
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,599
and then we'll go to ph down afterwards

864
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,558
but ph up he said you use a potassium

865
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:01,359
silicate or calcium carbonate

866
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:04,398
i watched your video on ph with chad

867
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:07,119
westport and you said it's you had it

868
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:09,038
under wrong to use potassium hydroxide

869
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:11,278
potassium carbonate and calcium

870
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:14,558
hydroxide why would why are those

871
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:16,000
categories as wrong to use as ph

872
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,558
sure so

873
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,839
um you can use a potassium carbonate i

874
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:21,440
just think it's

875
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:23,519
if you're gonna use it use potassium

876
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,278
bicarbonate because it's a better for

877
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,440
aquaponics specifically they dissolve

878
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:29,599
carbonate hardness if it gets too low

879
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,159
will actually hinder microbial

880
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:34,480
replication and you'll get up to 50

881
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,320
slower breeding rates of your microbes

882
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,399
that you're trying to harness to make

883
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:41,038
your plants healthy um so it's kind of

884
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:43,359
uh you know it's not it's just a lesser

885
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:45,038
option i guess but with the hydroxides

886
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:47,918
hydroxides are really easy to

887
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:50,319
accidentally overdose and way overshoot

888
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,200
they also can't be put on airplanes so i

889
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:54,960
don't like to use things that are rmd

890
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,120
which is what the the

891
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,120
military post office code was for it

892
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:00,959
when i used to work for them but a long

893
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:03,038
time ago in a different life

894
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,480
but uh anything that goes on a plane or

895
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:05,919
can't go on a plane i'm not gonna put in

896
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,759
my system if i'm gonna eat the

897
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,399
vegetables or consume those plants in

898
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:12,960
some form it's just to me

899
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:15,119
not not a good starter but it also only

900
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,798
adds one useful element when everything

901
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,558
else adds two

902
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:20,398
the carbonates add

903
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:21,759
alkalinity which helps your microbes and

904
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,239
adds minerals

905
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:26,079
and then you have the potassium silicate

906
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,319
which the potassium is helping and the

907
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:30,480
silica is helping so why would you add a

908
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:31,759
compound that's only adding one compound

909
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,159
that helps the plants when you can add a

910
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:35,839
compound that adds two you know it just

911
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,559
doesn't make any sense to me you're kind

912
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,558
of

913
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,879
spending money to do the same thing for

914
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:41,839
half as good of a product understood and

915
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,840
would you

916
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,759
say the same thing for somebody growing

917
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:47,839
in soil cocoa or is that

918
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:51,200
specifically for aquaponics what you

919
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:53,519
just said there uh well coco i would

920
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,000
personally i hate coco i think coco is

921
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,558
finicky plants are

922
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,038
just hard eat it's harder to maintain in

923
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:03,278
cocoa it's a lot easier to get pests and

924
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:05,919
bugs and stuff and i don't know i just i

925
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,759
always see like the worst farms i've

926
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,960
visited consulting i've almost always

927
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:12,079
been coco

928
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,120
um so i just i just don't i'm not a fan

929
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,798
of coco

930
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,719
i'm a big fan of living soil and a big

931
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:18,960
fan of aquaponics either method i think

932
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,519
is kind of the the top tier of the

933
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,399
industry in terms of terpene levels and

934
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,679
other important essential oil compounds

935
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:27,119
uh

936
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,559
in the plants that we're after you know

937
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,158
and the flavor compounds and other

938
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,720
things that we're all after for for high

939
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,320
quality organic produce

940
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,360
i think that that's really the best way

941
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:37,200
to um

942
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,959
to approach it and both of them again

943
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,480
are why are they the highest levels of

944
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,240
those compounds both of them are the

945
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,159
highest level microbial biodiversity in

946
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,000
the root systems you know it makes total

947
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,240
sense why they're both you know neck and

948
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,159
neck in terms of production of those

949
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,079
types of compounds just aquaponics does

950
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,640
it all twice as fast growth speed wise

951
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,960
so you get quite a few more you know

952
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:00,480
quite a bit more produce per year

953
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,640
uh than normal so ph down referring to

954
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,038
the one with chad westport the video i

955
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,960
just talked about you have phosphoric

956
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:09,200
acid muriatic acid which you just

957
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,519
mentioned as a ph down which you would

958
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,798
use for it you also have lactic acid

959
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,000
bacteria serum organic listed under

960
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:18,158
right

961
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,519
now under wrong

962
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,960
this is going to cause a little bit of

963
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,000
controversy here because i know a lot of

964
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,600
people use

965
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,599
vinegar

966
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:27,759
citric acid that's the two main ones

967
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:29,519
that people use all the time

968
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:32,000
for ph down and then you also have

969
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,798
nitric acid so why would why are those

970
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,398
under wrong sure so nitric acid

971
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:37,599
is the easiest one i guess to get out of

972
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:39,278
the way first

973
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:40,480
in aquaponics the fish provide all the

974
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:42,398
nitrogen i don't need to add more

975
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,919
nitrogen right we have all the nitrogen

976
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:47,119
we need it's already accounted for we're

977
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,880
budging in the fish output into the

978
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:51,599
nutrient solution and how much they're

979
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,960
producing per day so i that's accounted

980
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:54,879
for right so i don't want to add

981
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,600
nitrogen so that's that's that one

982
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,080
vinegar first off is a horribly poor at

983
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:02,319
weak acid it also creates all kinds of

984
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,038
secondary chemistry issues with polarity

985
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:05,519
and

986
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:07,200
just smells like i love eating vinegar

987
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,720
and vinegar chips but

988
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,319
a room with plants in it that has

989
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,558
vinegar and it just smells horrible to

990
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:14,639
me so um uh

991
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:17,038
i think that it's just

992
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,120
for your money spent you could buy a

993
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:20,879
much cheaper acid that's

994
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:23,038
you know much more effective that you

995
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,880
could dose a tenth as much to do the

996
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:27,440
same amount just it's not cost effective

997
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,120
economically citric acid acidic acid is

998
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,720
very weak as well

999
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:32,158
and and the same reason you also have a

1000
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,679
build up of some of the compounds in it

1001
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,360
if you're in a closed loop aquaponics

1002
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,278
system where we don't

1003
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:39,278
dump our reservoirs except

1004
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:41,679
maybe once every maybe a couple

1005
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:43,278
percentage points per month we're taking

1006
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,440
you know maybe three percent two percent

1007
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:47,278
per month this is a trickle off uh

1008
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,880
mainly to make sure we never get heavy

1009
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:50,079
metal issues

1010
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,360
over time

1011
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:52,960
from a water source unless we have a

1012
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:54,319
good filtration system then we don't

1013
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,720
need to do that

1014
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:58,000
but uh

1015
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,600
we just don't want to take the risk with

1016
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,440
that but the biggest thing comes down to

1017
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,839
is just cost you know if you're organic

1018
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,360
certified then yeah okay you're pigeon

1019
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:08,480
holed into doing that and i understand

1020
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:10,239
that and that's fine but i i most crops

1021
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,800
as well you if you're already doing

1022
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:15,039
aquaponics you can demand a very similar

1023
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,079
price point to organic certified without

1024
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:18,800
having to deal with all the rick and

1025
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,079
moral of of organic certification

1026
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,079
because it's quite expensive a lot of

1027
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,399
people don't realize how expensive it is

1028
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,079
not to mention the labor cost it takes a

1029
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:28,239
lot of labor time to do all the data

1030
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,760
entry to maintain your organic

1031
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,199
certification and you can be inspected

1032
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,639
at any time which

1033
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,199
a lot of people listening to the show or

1034
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,878
not be appreciating uh someone randomly

1035
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:40,000
showing up to inspect their facility for

1036
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:41,838
one reason or another so um you know all

1037
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,079
of those things are entailed along with

1038
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:45,759
you know whatever portion of the farm

1039
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,359
that you dedicate is organic certified

1040
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,879
production that's the only thing that

1041
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:51,119
you can do there you can't utilize that

1042
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:53,118
space for anything else so

1043
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,280
and the rules are overly restrictive and

1044
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,599
it just very few crops demand unless

1045
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,440
you're at a really large scale it's not

1046
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,800
generally worth it to go with organics i

1047
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,720
know that sounds horrible for an organic

1048
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,440
regenerative person to say but you're

1049
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:07,118
far better off just growing organically

1050
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,039
having regenerative practices getting

1051
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,559
some of the other cheaper certifications

1052
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:12,159
and getting the same price point as the

1053
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,320
organic guys you're going to get you

1054
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:15,759
know pretty much the same price anyway

1055
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,519
why pull your hair out and deal with the

1056
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,119
government when you can not do any of

1057
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:20,559
that and get paid the same i just don't

1058
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,880
see a point

1059
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,358
so for the ph

1060
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,480
down lactic acid bacteria serum

1061
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:30,319
phosphoric acid muriatic acid thumbs up

1062
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,480
not advised to use would be the vinicure

1063
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,640
citric acid and nitric acid

1064
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,599
for aquaponics would you say the same

1065
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:36,400
thing

1066
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,280
for

1067
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,960
soil and soilless mediums yeah if you're

1068
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,240
mixing a nutrient solution all those

1069
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,079
tough oats they pretty much should go

1070
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:45,358
the same way i mean yeah if you're in a

1071
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,119
pinch and you're out of everything else

1072
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:47,920
yeah you could use those like whatever

1073
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,519
like

1074
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,358
or if you're in soil you need to add

1075
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,960
nitrogen or cocoa and you need to add

1076
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:54,960
nitrogen you know because you're low on

1077
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,920
nitrogen and yeah use nitric acid right

1078
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,599
because

1079
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,760
chemically you're balancing it out for

1080
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,599
that right so it's just a matter of of

1081
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,520
using it appropriately with when and

1082
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,079
thinking about how you're balancing out

1083
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,838
that total nutrient solution um that

1084
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,880
you're trying to build up there

1085
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:12,880
that's really what it comes down to and

1086
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,559
you know i'm a big fan of again the uh

1087
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,039
you mentioned too the lactobacillus acid

1088
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:20,320
lactobacillic acid will a lower ph by

1089
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,838
0.1 to 0.2 points ph in a one to one

1090
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,680
thousand dosage

1091
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:25,519
so you know one gallon per thousand

1092
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:27,598
gallons lowers it that much it's

1093
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:28,960
decently strong as it compared to most

1094
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,559
of the others

1095
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,920
a lot of people are really concerned

1096
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,039
about using ph up and ph down

1097
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,280
because

1098
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:39,358
they are growing in living soil for

1099
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,040
example i know we're kind of getting off

1100
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:42,559
topic on the aquaponics thing but i

1101
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,239
think this is kind of important for for

1102
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:45,440
some people to hear

1103
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:47,358
is uh

1104
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,440
they're afraid that they're using these

1105
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:52,719
and they're killing off their microbes

1106
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,760
in the medium using ph up and down are

1107
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:57,838
those killing off microbes or or no so

1108
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,560
all ph up and all ph down will kill

1109
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:03,119
microbes if you use too much of it

1110
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:06,639
so the trick is to try and adjust 0.1 or

1111
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,240
0.2 ph in a 24 hour period so if you do

1112
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,078
it low and slow and you do it over the

1113
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:12,159
course of a week or two

1114
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,000
microbes don't care the plants aren't

1115
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:15,440
going to care your fish aren't going to

1116
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,679
care everything's going to be fine but

1117
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,838
if you swing it quickly you're screwed

1118
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:22,799
so what we normally do with ph up or ph

1119
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:25,199
down i'll mix it up into like a

1120
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,760
5 gallon or 10 gallon bucket and we'll

1121
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,679
sit it on the edge of the sump with a we

1122
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,960
drill out a hole in the bottom and then

1123
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,598
we'll put a

1124
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,559
uh airline little super glue an airline

1125
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,039
nipple

1126
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:39,358
that you can get for like 75 cents or 90

1127
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:41,039
cents of the pet store that has a little

1128
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:42,480
valve on it and then

1129
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,320
all you have to do once you have that

1130
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,079
glued into the bottom bucket is open it

1131
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,960
up so it's dripping or a small slow

1132
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,960
stream so that ph up is dosing over the

1133
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,679
course of four to six hours

1134
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,358
you know and slowly dosing the water and

1135
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:57,358
mixing in so you're not dumping a bunch

1136
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:59,119
of it and nuking everything right there

1137
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:01,440
you know it's kind of a slow adjustment

1138
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,880
and that's really the the trick to it is

1139
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,639
you know and if you don't have that kind

1140
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,000
of setup you can always build something

1141
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:08,559
that you know punch a little hole and

1142
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,239
have it you know you can time how long

1143
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:12,078
it takes to drain a container right like

1144
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:13,838
this is really basic simple stuff you

1145
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,680
can scale it to any size

1146
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:16,960
system that you're doing and it can be a

1147
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:18,319
really simple way to kind of time

1148
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,240
release it without having to have it you

1149
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,320
know i don't have to go

1150
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,000
dose it even if you did say i have i

1151
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,079
need to dose this many gallons of ph

1152
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,239
down you can mix that up and then just

1153
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,599
you know every 30 minutes just throw a

1154
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,279
cup in there or whatever you know if you

1155
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,359
want to do it by hand but that's the

1156
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,760
trick is doing it slowly last question

1157
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:37,838
on ph would be some people swear by the

1158
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,359
vinegar and the citric acid you know

1159
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:41,599
they're they're going to say that's way

1160
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,199
better to use than phosphoric acid or

1161
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,599
murionic acid

1162
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,358
and they say that microbes are safe i

1163
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,599
just want to reiterate that you're

1164
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:52,239
saying that if you're using enough of it

1165
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,640
vinegar and citric acid could certainly

1166
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,078
negatively impact the microbes oh yeah

1167
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:56,960
vinegar is used all the time as a

1168
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,119
cleaner

1169
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,119
like

1170
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:02,078
my grandma used to use it as a cleaner

1171
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:04,159
like

1172
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,079
you make that and some lemon juice and

1173
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:08,960
throw it you know make the whole kitchen

1174
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,000
smell like uh you know lemon vinegar but

1175
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,079
um

1176
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,480
you know it'll kill microbes again it's

1177
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,599
the concentrations it you any of these

1178
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,880
if you're using them a strong

1179
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,079
concentration of course they're going to

1180
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,920
kill stuff

1181
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,240
but there's no difference between or you

1182
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,079
know vinegar ph down from vinegar and or

1183
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:25,358
citric acid in terms of its ability to

1184
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,440
kill microbes

1185
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:30,319
it's killing microbes because the shift

1186
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,159
the rapid shift in ph not because of the

1187
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,079
chemical compound the chemical compound

1188
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:36,719
of any of these is not toxic

1189
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,519
you know you can uh

1190
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:42,319
muriatic acid is using candy

1191
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:44,000
it's used phosphoric acid is in soda

1192
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,160
right like these these aren't scary

1193
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,239
compounds right like they're i think

1194
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:50,639
oftentimes people think they hear acid

1195
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:52,479
or they hear like you know whatever

1196
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:53,920
mineral because that's in a mineral name

1197
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,000
and it's like well yeah but you use it

1198
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,680
in your food all the time like it's

1199
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,920
calcium carbonate's a bread leveler

1200
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:01,598
right like

1201
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,200
it's nothing scary

1202
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,039
thanks for the clarification there

1203
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:06,159
because uh ph is certainly one of those

1204
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:07,759
hot topics where i think there's a lot

1205
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:09,519
of misunderstanding

1206
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,560
on it well i think the biggest

1207
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:14,079
misunderstanding in ph is ph people use

1208
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:16,078
the word ph and alkalinity

1209
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,400
interchangeably which is completely

1210
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,359
wrong like i don't know how that got

1211
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,440
started

1212
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:24,078
but alkalinity is your dkh your

1213
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,079
dissolved carbonate hardness which is

1214
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,640
measured in two ways either dkh which is

1215
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,400
dissolved carbonate hardness units or in

1216
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:31,598
parts per million so you can measure it

1217
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,400
either way

1218
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:40,000
usually you want 2 to 5 dkh which is

1219
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:42,079
36.7 or 36.8 i don't remember exactly um

1220
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,400
parts per million to like 80 parts per

1221
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,720
million plus minus so that that's your

1222
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,318
your target range um to make sure you're

1223
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:50,318
not overshooting your ph because if you

1224
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:52,000
go above those levels i just mentioned

1225
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:54,559
you're going to wait over shoot your ph

1226
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,719
just by default you know your alkalinity

1227
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:58,719
is your stability of your ph so your

1228
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:01,759
higher your alkalinity the less likely

1229
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:03,679
you are to have a ph shift or ph change

1230
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,599
whereas the the short the lower the

1231
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:07,199
alkalinity you can have a

1232
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,800
really low alkalinity and if you check

1233
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,480
your ph every day when you come home

1234
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,318
from work at 5 pm

1235
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,880
it'll be the same but if you check it at

1236
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:16,159
5 00 a.m it could shift by two-thirds of

1237
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,720
a point

1238
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:20,399
as the photosynthetic bacteria wake up

1239
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:22,799
or go to sleep and and the chemistry

1240
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,280
starts to change overnight so you know

1241
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,480
just depends on you know what water

1242
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,000
chemistry you have but you can have

1243
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,838
pretty severe ones so if you are seeing

1244
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
a bouncing of your ph over 24-hour

1245
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:33,199
period even without an alkalinity test

1246
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,880
you can immediately tell your alkalinity

1247
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,279
is too low sounds like that's a common

1248
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,160
mistake especially for beginners that

1249
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,599
they make there is confusing the two or

1250
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:42,799
using them interchangeably like you

1251
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,800
mentioned

1252
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,400
what are some other common mistakes that

1253
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,880
people make when trying to grow with

1254
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:53,200
aquaponics sure over feeding i think

1255
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:55,680
that's another one um or having like

1256
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:58,719
nowhere near enough fish um or two way

1257
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,639
too many fish um those in other ones or

1258
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:02,239
people having like tons of gravel in an

1259
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:03,920
aquarium where they're trying to also

1260
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:06,000
get the poop to flow out to get to the

1261
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,760
plants you know it's you gotta have a

1262
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,920
bare bottom aquarium or close to it uh

1263
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,599
to have a uh any kind of aquaponic

1264
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,880
system it works better not say you can't

1265
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,800
but it'll work a lot better if you do um

1266
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,720
trying to think what else people using

1267
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,119
all kinds of weird cockamamie stuff for

1268
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:27,279
pest control like people spraying their

1269
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:29,358
plants with windex or oxiclean or like

1270
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,599
you name it if it remotely sounds like

1271
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,199
it might be organic or natural i've had

1272
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,680
people spray it on it and then call me

1273
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:37,118
and tell me they did it like

1274
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:38,799
just because it has a lemon scent

1275
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,559
doesn't mean that you should spray it on

1276
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,240
plants like i don't like there's just

1277
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,480
people get all these weird ideas on

1278
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:46,078
stuff i've had

1279
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,159
some stories that i can't mention on

1280
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,000
here without ruining your your ability

1281
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:52,480
to monetize this episode

1282
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,679
um and uh

1283
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,358
yeah

1284
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,519
some pretty ridiculous stuff that i've

1285
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:59,679
been asked over the years but i think

1286
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:01,679
most of the weirder ones we had i think

1287
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:03,598
by far the one and i've had this i had

1288
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,838
like three calls all within like a year

1289
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,480
of the same question is like what is the

1290
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:09,599
acceptable level of radon and uranium in

1291
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,079
the water

1292
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,599
uh that i can use for borewater in

1293
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,280
australia and it was like the same

1294
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,039
little area that all had like the same

1295
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,599
idea to get into aquaponics at the same

1296
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:22,000
time in the middle of nowhere australia

1297
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,760
and they had high levels of uranium and

1298
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,199
and and radon in the water and i was

1299
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,599
like

1300
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:28,639
do not use that water for anything lit

1301
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,440
like

1302
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,000
no

1303
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,358
no there is the answer is zero zero is

1304
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,239
the acceptable level like

1305
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:39,920
oh man that's crazy that is crazy so

1306
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:42,318
what advice do you have for folks that

1307
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,960
are just starting with aquaponics sure

1308
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:46,800
so i would just say um you know read up

1309
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,800
a bunch on different youtube channels

1310
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,400
and things like that um make sure you

1311
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,160
understand how an aquarium works from a

1312
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,000
chemistry standpoint planted aquariums

1313
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:55,759
especially can be a really good way to

1314
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,079
kind of better understand the chemistry

1315
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,800
uh in terms of chemical interactions

1316
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,200
uh of of uh an aquaponic system because

1317
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,720
aquaponics doesn't have a lot of good

1318
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,960
because it was approached so heavily

1319
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:08,399
from the hydroponic people

1320
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,400
and like universities that had

1321
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,160
hydroponic or

1322
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,000
agriculture programs they didn't really

1323
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,279
in my opinion approach it originally

1324
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,280
from the right way

1325
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,480
um you know they they didn't approach it

1326
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,760
from the standpoint of um

1327
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,000
uh

1328
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,319
again living aquatic soil you know the

1329
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,480
the that the microbe diversity was as

1330
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:30,000
important as the mineral levels and and

1331
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,920
trying to max that's why i think that

1332
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,119
you have such a wonderful marriage with

1333
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,519
knf and aquaponics because it hybridizes

1334
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,880
so freaking well and allows us to unlock

1335
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:40,960
in some cases eighty percent more

1336
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,800
minerals from our fish waste when we

1337
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,720
start to add things like liquid imo and

1338
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,039
labs to the system we've also noticed

1339
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:48,959
that labs completely eliminates a

1340
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:51,679
waterborne e coli

1341
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,280
as well as um uh salmonella and a couple

1342
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:54,719
of other pathogens that we've had done

1343
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,640
some testing on so i think that you're

1344
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:58,559
gonna see you know in five or ten years

1345
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:00,879
from now uh lactobacillus dosing

1346
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:02,719
required for food safety protocols for

1347
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,640
any kind of food production aquaponics

1348
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:06,559
you know or even hydroponics potentially

1349
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,400
because why would you not add something

1350
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:10,318
that accelerates your plant growth rate

1351
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,480
and eliminates pathogens it's kind of a

1352
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:14,639
win-win and it's low cost i mean you can

1353
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,960
do a facility of 10 000 square feet for

1354
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:18,879
like eight bucks a week or whatever you

1355
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,440
know it's not breaking the bank in any

1356
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,200
way like it's it's cheap stuff

1357
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,440
that's really interesting so yeah it

1358
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:26,960
seems like it's a sustainable approach

1359
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,960
that's going to become more and more

1360
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,720
popular it was certainly surprising when

1361
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,440
we were running the trials with the labs

1362
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:35,439
we had a non just by happenstance happen

1363
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,119
to have a non-pathogenic non-human

1364
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,039
pathogenic e coli strain in there it's a

1365
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,039
soil e coli there's thousands of

1366
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:42,239
different ones that do different soil

1367
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:44,159
functions and stuff like that but it

1368
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:46,000
happened to end up in the system

1369
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:47,920
we ended up doing a treatment of it and

1370
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,920
realized hey it eliminated the e coli

1371
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,318
isn't that a weird side effect so then

1372
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,838
we had another farm a lettuce farm that

1373
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:55,920
was a commercial farm that had tested

1374
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:57,759
hot for e coli in their water we tried

1375
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,280
it and within 30 days eliminated it from

1376
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,960
there and we've done two more farms

1377
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,720
since then that we've managed to have

1378
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,400
similar type water pathogen issues where

1379
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:05,919
the water department came in more happy

1380
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,200
with them with their water results and

1381
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,880
within 30 days we've been able to

1382
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:11,598
mitigate it using um you know korean

1383
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,800
natural farming practices lactobacillus

1384
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,280
in particular

1385
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,680
to eliminate those those things so again

1386
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,760
the more we learn about um you know the

1387
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:21,679
the soil food web and you know the the

1388
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,599
different food webs of our planet the

1389
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:25,118
more we're improving our food safety and

1390
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,480
improving plant production at the same

1391
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,318
time

1392
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,880
that's incredible yeah definitely a big

1393
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:33,279
success story there cool well i

1394
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,680
appreciate you letting me ask you some

1395
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,760
beginner questions there

1396
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:39,440
i i'm sure we could have gone over a lot

1397
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,520
more i really wanted this to be just the

1398
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,280
basics of aquaponics you know more like

1399
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:45,280
an introduction to it

1400
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,040
you're the first person on this podcast

1401
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,200
that i've ever has ever talked about

1402
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,279
aquaponics so i think an introduction to

1403
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:52,639
begin maybe in the future we can do a

1404
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,960
part two with something more a little

1405
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:56,799
bit more advanced knowledge

1406
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,079
for the folks that do have experience

1407
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,839
and maybe they can get a little bit more

1408
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,640
out of it but i definitely think looking

1409
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:04,239
back the ph in particular is not only

1410
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:06,078
going to help people who are in

1411
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:08,239
aquaponics but also help the folks

1412
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,359
growing in soil and soilless mediums as

1413
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:10,959
well so

1414
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:13,598
appreciate you sharing that with us

1415
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,440
today before we wrap things up tell us

1416
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,680
how can the listeners find you and what

1417
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,119
do you have upcoming in the future

1418
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:21,039
sure so um

1419
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,880
i have my own podcast as well called the

1420
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,599
growing the fishes podcast we're on our

1421
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,280
sixth year this year we're at almost 300

1422
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:29,280
episodes

1423
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,519
we're coming up on

1424
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,480
you can check that out we've interviewed

1425
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:37,119
a ridiculous slew of people we had a

1426
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,000
frenchie on twice who since since passed

1427
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:42,079
away recently we had um a ton of other

1428
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,480
activists that have are no longer with

1429
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,480
us and then a whole bunch of uh experts

1430
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,440
from around the world everyone from you

1431
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:53,519
know soil scientists to genetics experts

1432
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:55,200
to uh we had a whole 14 hours on

1433
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:57,679
plant protections and things like that

1434
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:59,759
after the you know filo scandal and we

1435
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:02,159
really try to cover every aspect of this

1436
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,599
industry and and there is maybe a slight

1437
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:05,598
leaning towards the commercial side of

1438
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,519
it just because that is what what i do

1439
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,559
and most of the panelists do just for a

1440
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:10,559
living but

1441
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,079
we do cover uh you know a lot of

1442
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:14,559
homegirl stuff and it is all geared

1443
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,839
towards living soil and aquaponics uh if

1444
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,519
you're interested in aquaponics the

1445
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:19,920
first 16 episodes are kind of more of a

1446
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,599
how-to beginner's guide to get started

1447
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,200
after that we really kind of assume that

1448
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,400
hey we gave you the base knowledge now

1449
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:25,838
we're going to start to get more

1450
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,160
complicated to build upon what we've

1451
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:29,920
been teaching you um and then we also

1452
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:32,039
have a uh marty and i the co-host of the

1453
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,480
podcast have a whole online school ap

1462
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:55,760
we have the supernatural conference

1463
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,199
coming up in july 29th 30th and 31st in

1464

oklahoma city

1465
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:01,679
i will be speaking there on ipmo which

1466
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,440
is advanced um

1467
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:06,239
imo collections specifically for

1468
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,440
targeting pests and infecting pests with

1469
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:10,078
natural predators so i'm going to be

1470
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,440
teaching a little seminar on that

1471
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,920
as well as some other cool advanced

1472
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,599
korean natural farming methodologies

1473
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,400
along with chris trump

1474
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,480

1476
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,199
of other awesome organic experts and

1477
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,280
then all i have um

1480
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:32,719
she's one of the leading researchers if

1481
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,440
you're into learning more about how to

1482
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:37,919
hybridize aquaculture waste and inputs

1483
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,679
with soil production they utilize that

1484
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:43,119
have done lots of testing they've shown

1485
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:45,679
that it can increase thc cbd and other

1486
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:48,079
types of important compound expressions

1487
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:50,480
essential oil for compound production

1488
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,160
by as much as uh 17

1489
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,318
and some of the terpene expressions by

1490
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:56,799
as much as 40 percent

1491
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:57,838
and total crop yield by as much as 53

1492
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,000
percent

1493
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:02,159
and this is by utilizing a heavy living

1494
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,239
soil you know happy good

1495
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:05,920
living soil and then watering it with

1496
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:07,679
just base filtered water versus

1497
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,838
aquaculture water so

1498
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:12,000
that really does make a huge huge

1499
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:14,239
difference in the chemistry and then on

1500
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,760
the 12th of may we have tommy chong

1501
