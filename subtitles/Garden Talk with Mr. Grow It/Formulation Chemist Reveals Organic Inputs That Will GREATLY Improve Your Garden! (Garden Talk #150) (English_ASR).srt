you on this podcast so I can pick your

81
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,120
brain individually without Rob and

82
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,920
pigeons you know asking some questions

83
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,280
I've got you done myself this time so

84
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,559
really excited for this so we're going

85
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,519
to talk about a whole bunch of different

86
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,280
things today you for me formated vitana

87
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,000
plant science that whole nutrient line

88
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,799
you formulated stash blend which is uh

89
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,759
my audience is very familiar with that

90
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,599
so I'm excited to get into those things

91
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,759
but before we get too deep into things

92
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:14,000
could you tell us a little bit about

93
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,798
yourself and how you got into gardening

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,519
yeah it's a really good question I mean

95
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,680
it it's it was kind of one piece at a

96
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,400
time right I mean you you you grow up

97
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,920
and uh you know I did a lot of upick um

98
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,039
fruit picking with my mother and that

99
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,000
would go into kind of making jams and

100
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,079
pies and other types of baked goods he's

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,158
kind of had this I had this Fascination

102
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,080
I think with this connection of you know

103
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,318
being able to see something from start

104
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,680
to finish and growing something and then

105
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,598
making that into a product and then

106
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,799
sharing that you know throughout the

107
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:46,119
seasons and and all the emotions that

108
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,040
went with that and as I got older I got

109
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,799
to be a lot more curious about the about

110
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:51,639
the science side so I went way to Purdue

111
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,280
I studed a lot of plant physiology plant

112
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:56,158
metabolomics right and then you know I

113
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,919
got into the agrochemical industry and

114
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:02,280
the fertilizer industry and and really

115
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:05,199
do more research and figure out you know

116
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,598
how can we effectuate changes in in crop

117
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:10,158
physiology and maximize our yields and

118
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:13,238
just it kind of like all the emotions

119
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:15,759
and and and everything kind of came

120
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,798
together and did my scientific interest

121
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,599
overlapped and you know here we are

122
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:22,279
today um it's been a journey let's put

123
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,639
it that way awesome and then when did

124
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:26,839
you kind of link up and get Ventana of

125
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,918
plant science going there was a few

126
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:31,038
seasons back now um oddly enough it's

127
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,599
funny how time worked works right um

128
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:36,599
kind time fing having fun been a few

129
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,000
years now and you know Nate was an

130
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,800
introduction uh Nate Lipton who heads up

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,759
bana um he he was an introduction of

132
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,439
mutual friend and we just hit it off I

133
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,160
mean Nate's Nate's moving to Shaker man

134
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:52,519
he uh n is excited about Innovation and

135
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,439
there was just this kind of immediate

136
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:56,758
connection and we kind of sat down at

137
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,439
the table and said hey you know with

138
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,840
everything that you know and all the

139
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:01,199
people that you know and everything that

140
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,719
know I think there's some creative work

141
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,600
that can get done here and it's just

142
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,919
been it's been a blast working with him

143
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,479
and his team innovating and and putting

144
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:10,478
stuff out like stash you know is

145
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:11,918
obviously you a great example of that

146
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,680
yeah stash Bland I mean I was thinking

147
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:16,680
back that you formulated that two and a

148
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,079
half years ago now if I remember

149
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,680
correctly and then obviously we did a

150
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:23,399
year of testing before even releasing

151
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,680
and stuff like that so man time does fly

152
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:28,318
for sure it does man the gray hair and

153
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,079
the beard is no longer accidental it uh

154
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,160
you know I I wake up one day and I'm

155
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:34,800
like am I an old man yet and if not how

156
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,160
much longer I got to go because I feel

157
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
like it you

158
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,639
know so getting into I want to get into

159
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,919
stash blend first a little bit and I

160
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,439
know some people might be like oh well

161
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,680
this is just going to be an infomercial

162
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,519
for stash blend it's there going to be

163
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,439
more to it than just stash BL don't

164
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,959
worry but I do want to dive into some of

165
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,800
the ingredients because we do get a lot

166
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,959
of questions some really good questions

167
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,120
from folks that are using stash Bland or

168
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,038
interested in using stash Bland and one

169
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,680
of the main questions that we get is

170
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,959
about one of the ingredients which is

171
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,439
corn steep liquor can you tell us all

172
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:08,439
about corn steep liquor everything from

173
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,719
what it is its benefits how it's sourced

174
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:13,038
so on and so forth yeah absolutely and

175
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,360
so so corn seed liquer is a byproduct of

176
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,598
of wet corn Milling right so when you

177
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,919
take the corn typically there's

178
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:19,719
something you want to produce from that

179
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,680
corn right it's a lot here in the US we

180
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,160
do we produce a lot of ethanol from corn

181
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,519
right that goes into fuels but we also

182
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,840
we also produce a lot of starches uh

183
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,279
which you know will go down and create

184
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,560
modified starches and a lot of things

185
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,000
like that

186
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,839
um and we also produce a lot of high

187
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,800
fructose corn syrup from there right and

188
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:40,719
so the byproduct um from that process is

189
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,800
corn steep liquor right so when you go

190
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,520
through and you go through that wet

191
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,400
Milling process all the amino acids all

192
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:50,359
the proteins all the vitamins all the

193
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:53,439
minerals AKA not the starches not the uh

194
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,919
the uh the sugars right that that all

195
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,240
used to get just pitched down the drain

196
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:59,279
it was a waste product and then someone

197
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,800
at some point in time said now hold on a

198
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,918
minute we've got all these great

199
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,400
proteins peptides amino acids all these

200
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:05,680
great vitamins and minerals there's

201
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,399
something we should be able to do with

202
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,400
this and it didn't take the plant

203
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:11,638
Community along to figure out that it

204
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:15,359
was really an excellent source of of

205
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,280
nutrition at the end of the day and you

206
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,639
know I think for me when you look at the

207
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:23,000
way corn steep liquor is used right now

208
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:25,519
it's used as a food source for a lot of

209
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,720
fermentation uh large scale uh

210
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,758
fermentation work that that that goes on

211
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,479
because it's such an excellent uh

212
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,240
fermentation product for biology too and

213
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:35,598
food source and so when you look at a

214
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,879
lot of the other ingredients in stash

215
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:38,959
and you look at the overlaps and the

216
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,960
synergies that were creating corn steep

217
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,519
lier as a foundation was a really great

218
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,158
fit um it's a upcycle product would have

219
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,439
gone into a waist Stream So that checks

220
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:49,918
the box from environmental perspective

221
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,680
great nutritional mineral amino acid

222
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,918
protein profile and uh yeah it's a

223
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,478
little sticky to work with so there's

224
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,198
some things we spray dry it into a

225
00:07:55,478 --> 00:08:00,399
powder and things along those lines but

226
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,319
um that's that's really you know the

227
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,839
foundation of stash and why it's a

228
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,639
foundation of stash it's a it's a great

229
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,119
great foundational product yeah I know

230
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,720
that's listed as one of the top

231
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:14,240
ingredients for it and contributes to

232
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,800
the the NPK yes one of the questions

233
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,038
that people have asked about the corn

234
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:22,800
steep liquor is would you happen to know

235
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:25,038
if the corn was GMO or non-GMO does that

236
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
matter uh yeah you know it really

237
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,639
doesn't matter at that point in time

238
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,240
right um you know because you're all

239
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,120
you're talking about extra in and so the

240
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,158
proteins that come out of that you know

241
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,158
are really not going to make a

242
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:37,838
difference at the end of the day we do

243
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:38,599
use an organic corn steep liquer so that

244
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,200
would be

245
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,120
non-GMO um and that's that's a lot of

246
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,240
where you know the corn steep liquor

247
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,519
ends up is more in organic applications

248
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,360
so that's kind of the um that that's

249
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,240
kind of the niche that it fills you can

250
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,320
have a non-organic I suppose GMO corn

251
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,278
steep liquor but the iteration that we

252
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,760
use is is organic compliant good to know

253
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,600
and talking about organic compliance I

254
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,039
think it's appropriate to talk a little

255
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,839
bit about omry certification I know we

256
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:11,159
did touch upon this in a conversation on

257
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,079
from the stash but I think it warrants

258
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:15,679
on here as well since there's a bit of a

259
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:17,399
different audience on here but omry

260
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,239
certification we get this question a lot

261
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,600
is like why isn't stash blend omry

262
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,278
certified and this is a conversation

263
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,240
that we had behind the scenes I know you

264
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:28,879
you probably remember this and it was

265
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,560
kind of generally advised not to go the

266
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,519
omry certification route can you just

267
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,919
break it down for us like omry

268
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,360
certification what is it and what are

269
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:39,319
like the pros and cons of being omry

270
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,240
certified well I think any certification

271
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,959
any third party certification that you

272
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,519
have it it's you know it helps it helps

273
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,359
Market the product right I mean it's

274
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,120
something that people can recognize

275
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,278
there are other theoretically other

276
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,120
organic certifying agencies that are out

277
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:56,958
there right um California's got theirs

278
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,320
Washington's got theirs as an example so

279
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,799
just because you don't go to rout of

280
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,399
omry doesn't mean you could do an

281
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:04,679
Organic certification through another

282
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:07,559
organic certifier but um you know omry

283
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:08,958
charges per per size of skew I mean last

284
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,119
I checked anyway it's me it's been a

285
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,879
little while but uh so if we wanted to

286
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,560
sell a one pound bag and a half pound

287
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,720
bag or 50 Grand bag we'd have to pay

288
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:20,078
different uh prices you know for each

289
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,360
one of those SKS Armory is you know the

290
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,319
organic materials review Institute it's

291
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,959
it's valuable in my estimation it's it's

292
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,800
run by people so it's not a perfect not

293
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,319
a perfect organization by any stretch

294
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,519
imagination

295
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,600
um I would say philosophically some of

296
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,879
the stuff that's on there from an armor

297
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,000
perspective can be a head scratcher for

298
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:41,120
me um and some of the stuff that's not

299
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,120
on there can be a head scratcher for me

300
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,159
I mean for instance the uh the

301
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,360
polyaspartic acid that we have in there

302
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:50,480
which I'm sure we'll talk about here in

303
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:53,560
a bit that that's from sugars that have

304
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,480
been fermented into fic acid and then

305
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:58,679
aspartic acid and then um you know

306
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,600
that's uh we use heat to polymerize the

307
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:03,638
aspartic acid and omry says well since

308
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,320
you're using heat to do that it's not

309
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:09,839
organic anymore and it's like well you

310
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,800
know why not but it's it's just you know

311
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,959
their their philosophies their take on

312
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:16,159
things versus you know ours and um you

313
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,799
know we have some ingredients in there

314
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,159
that omry says they they don't want to

315
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:21,838
certify and that's that's fine but we

316
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,480
want to have the best products possible

317
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,519
out to the out to the consumer and

318
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,759
that's the route that we went yeah and I

319
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,919
think also the fees were a big turn off

320
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,879
I mean the amount of money that you got

321
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:34,000
to pay just to get the omry

322
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:36,159
certification is pretty extensive and

323
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,919
what do you get out of it you get to use

324
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,000
the logo on the product well big whoop

325
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:41,919
you know some people are going to care

326
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,720
about it but I think a lot of consumers

327
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,319
these days they don't really care as

328
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,040
much about it you know so yeah we chose

329
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,720
not to go the omry certification route

330
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:51,799
for for those reasons really yeah I mean

331
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,000
we we want to do right by the

332
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:54,679
environment want to do right by our

333
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,278
customer right and if It just fits to

334
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:58,120
where hey we can also get a third party

335
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:59,720
certification that people see and

336
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,759
understand and recognize and appreciate

337
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,240
that's great but you know if we have the

338
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,759
right ingredients in there and they've

339
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,278
got the right pedigree and they're doing

340
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:07,399
the right thing for the plants and the

341
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:09,480
right thing for the

342
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,559
planet I that's that's the most

343
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,680
important piece of the puzzle to me

344
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:14,599
completely agree and that's where I

345
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:16,239
think we were all aligned you know when

346
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,800
we sat down and we had these meetings on

347
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,278
it we were just we were completely all

348
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:21,000
on the same page on that we want to do

349
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,399
what's best for the environment and best

350
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,879
for the customer as well having this

351
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,480
all-in-one blend uh was a huge win for

352
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:27,838
the customers just less bottles they

353
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,278
have to you know there are less

354
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,279
individual bottles that they have to buy

355
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,799
his additives so having this all inone

356
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:37,159
blend so it's really really been good on

357
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:39,399
that Avenue as well seaweed extract I

358
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,519
like to get into that next now this is a

359
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:44,078
pretty common input a lot of people use

360
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,720
seaweed but break it down for us what is

361
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:49,239
seaweed extract what are the benefits

362
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,720
how is it sourced so on and so forth

363
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,240
yeah so seaweed grows all the way around

364
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,440
the world right the first thing you have

365
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,079
to answer is what kind of seaweed do you

366
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,720
play with right because there are some

367
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:00,399
species of seaweed that's been their

368
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,399
entire life life and water right think

369
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,078
of the Kel Forest sou California as an

370
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,559
example right but you know what we're

371
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:09,319
interested in is those you know

372
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,879
intertitle Zone species right an asphy

373
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,440
andad doam is probably the uh the most

374
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:15,919
obvious example one and that's the one

375
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,880
that we use and and what happens that

376
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,198
those seaweeds you know end up spending

377
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:23,159
half their life outside of water as the

378
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:24,759
water recedes and when you do that you

379
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,039
create incredibly stressful environment

380
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:28,198
for the plant and that's why the plant's

381
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,679
producing all these secondary

382
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:32,679
metabolites to survive in those

383
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:34,359
conditions and it's those secondary

384
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,919
metabolizes from seaweed that we really

385
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,680
like now you can take and harvest that

386
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:41,278
seaweed which is absolutely sustainable

387
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:44,719
the seaweed that we uh actually get is

388
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:47,039
from the uh coast of Ireland um

389
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,360
completely sustainably Harvest and

390
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:52,278
harvested and uh you can take that

391
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,800
seaweed and you can Mill it wet Mill it

392
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:58,240
into a seaweed dispersion right and you

393
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:59,559
get all the cell walls and all the detis

394
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,198
and all the lake

395
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:03,638
and all the hemicellulose and everything

396
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:07,240
that's ins soluble in that product along

397
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:10,079
with that uh but what we've taken to do

398
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:13,079
is we take that and we Mill the seaweed

399
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:15,638
and then we extract that with pottassium

400
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:17,958
hydroxide to create a soluble extraction

401
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,839
of all those little goodies that we like

402
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,679
and that does two things one it cuts out

403
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,320
all the ligin and the hemicellulose and

404
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,439
all the cell wall stuff that you don't

405
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,320
need and that's not soluble in water and

406
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,079
and and two it it increases your

407
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,879
concentration all those beautiful

408
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:35,399
secondary metabolize those plant defense

409
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,198
mechanisms uh compounds and and the

410
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:41,159
rooting hormones and things along those

411
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:43,319
lines that are in uh seaweeds that that

412
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:47,120
we like and that's um that's the route

413
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,959
that we went so ask found doome arid off

414
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,919
Ireland extract from potassium hydroxide

415
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,518
and that gives you the cleanest product

416
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,360
with the highest concentration of all

417
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,639
the all the goodies that we like in

418
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,199
there yeah I was going to ask you about

419
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,919
the pottassium hydroxide next because

420
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:01,240
that is listed on the label but I

421
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:02,679
remember in a past conversation you

422
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,560
mentioned it's not really in there

423
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:06,638
anymore but you have to put it on there

424
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,078
from a regulatory standpoint fertilizer

425
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,600
laws require you to put that on there

426
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:12,599
yes but you did cckm for wrong you

427
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,120
mentioned that some pottassium is

428
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,920
available on there right because there's

429
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,560
a reaction that happen can you get into

430
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:21,198
that yeah exactly potassium hydroxide is

431
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,719
Koh right you've got your potassium ion

432
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,758
you have your hydroxide ion your

433
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,800
potassium is positive your hydroxide is

434
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:29,519
negative and what happens is that when

435
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,679
you react that with usually to lower pH

436
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,198
secondary plant metabolites the

437
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,039
potassium remains and the hydroxide ions

438
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:37,838
actually react with the hydrogen ions

439
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:40,039
that come off the other compounds

440
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,959
creating water so you end up with

441
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:44,278
potassium salts of all the other goodies

442
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:46,719
that you like and water as your reaction

443
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:49,879
product so there's no potassium

444
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,720
hydroxide that actually remains as

445
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:53,799
potassium hydroxide anymore so you end

446
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,360
up water and potassium and all your

447
00:15:53,799 --> 00:16:00,159
secondary metabolites but the labeling

448
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,079
laws uh and under AFCO and state byst

449
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,719
state require that if you use a

450
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:07,719
pottassium if you use a um a seaweed

451
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,759
extracted product you have to list the

452
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,639
potassium hydroxide in there with it's

453
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,639
just kind of goofy and again you know I

454
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,959
think like that's probably another thing

455
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,919
that you look at with the labeling laws

456
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,599
you know I think that they always come

457
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:23,078
from like a point of of good intentions

458
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,360
but I think sometimes they actually

459
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:28,239
create a lot more confusion than they

460
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,480
actually resolve and uh but that's you

461
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,240
know there another podcast conversation

462
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,440
you know for another

463
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,360
day yeah I'm sure we could get it super

464
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,759
deep about that but uh yeah we'll avoid

465
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,079
that conversation for now yeah but one

466
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,120
thing I did want to mention that when we

467
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,399
talk about labeling there is something

468
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,600
that is in stash blend that's not on the

469
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,198
label and that is the amino acid polymer

470
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,560
and I forget the reason why you

471
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,799
mentioned why it can't be on the label

472
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:56,799
maybe you can expand on that a little

473
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,599
bit can you talk to us about amino acid

474
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:02,958
polymer just in general everything about

475
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,078
yeah absolutely so you know there's

476
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,119
there's there's a number of different

477
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,159
amino acid polymers that you know are

478
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:10,958
out there and obviously you know amino

479
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,959
acids hook together to create peptides

480
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,720
and then from peptides they grow into

481
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,759
proteins right and you know what we try

482
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,279
to do though with our amino acid

483
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:24,640
polymers it's it's we take a singular

484
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:26,279
amino acid which is a spartic acid right

485
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,080
and then we take that as spartic acid

486
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:33,119
and we use exceptionally high heat right

487
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:35,199
500° F and we fused those aspartic acid

488
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:38,000
monomers together to form an aspartic

489
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,080
acid polymer and from there we'll react

490
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,119
it with potassium hydroxide where we

491
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:45,558
heard this before to make it a soluble

492
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:49,239
polymer instead of an insoluble polymer

493
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:52,000
and um there the story behind how this

494
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,798
concept came about actually uh

495
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,798
originates from the late 80s they had

496
00:17:54,798 --> 00:18:01,519
discovered that mollusks in the ocean

497
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:05,599
build their shells out by taking calcium

498
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:08,440
from the Water by using an aspartic acid

499
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:10,599
polymer and it's a completely a lot of

500
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,600
our polymers out there have that a

501
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:14,359
synthetic man-made polymers that we use

502
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:17,158
like polyacrylates and things along

503
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:18,959
those lines uh they're not biodegradable

504
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:23,360
right so they don't break down in the

505
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,079
environment and so someone said hey look

506
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:28,240
you know we've got mollusks that are

507
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:30,319
creating this amino acid polymer to grab

508
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,679
on the nutrients to help build out their

509
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:37,480
shells wouldn't this work in agriculture

510
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:41,120
and if so how could we diagram a way to

511
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,159
produce this in mass and predictably and

512
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,158
get this out in agriculture because we

513
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:47,679
we can use this to grab nutrients out of

514
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:51,039
the soil and increased nutrient uptake

515
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:54,240
and oh by the way the process to make it

516
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,960
you only your byproduct is water vapor

517
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,880
and your polymer is fully

518
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,640
biodegradable and actually the polymer

519
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,960
that we make is food great it actually

520
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,280
there's probably another conversation

521
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,319
with another day but it actually goes

522
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:08,639
into uh beverages all over the world uh

523
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:10,359
certain very specific beverages but um

524
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,559
again it's another story for another day

525
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:15,678
but um that's you know that's the whole

526
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:17,000
story so but again there's labeling laws

527
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,000
and there's requirements there's all

528
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,720
sorts of stuff and so we wanted to have

529
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,119
the best possible product we wanted to

530
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,440
to have something was going to increase

531
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,439
nutritional uptake in Plants right which

532
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,880
is really you know the the whole secret

533
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,480
story behind that has blend and uh you

534
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,919
know we do that with Biology we're doing

535
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,640
that with seaweeds we're doing that with

536
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,080
corn steep Liquors that's feeding the

537
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,240
biology in the plant and then we have

538
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:44,558
this this beautiful uh aspartic acid

539
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,240
polymer that's in that mix that's uh

540
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,639
chemically helping grab onto the

541
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,079
nutrients and also acting as a terrific

542
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,559
food source for the bacteria and biology

543
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:56,038
on the back end so um but it's not on

544
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,798
the label because again you know

545
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:01,400
labeling requirements and and things

546
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:04,000
like that and you know we've got Decades

547
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,320
of research on this stuff but it it

548
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,400
never seems to be in the exact right

549
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,759
format that each state want some states

550
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,919
have no problem some states and

551
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:14,839
predictably you're going to know

552
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,240
probably which states those are um I

553
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:19,639
think they just like putting their ores

554
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,480
in the water you know what I mean and uh

555
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,840
so that's you know that's a little bit

556
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,798
behind so we kind of go back to that

557
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:26,480
labeling law stuff and then the tents

558
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,200
are good but it actually ends up harming

559
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,640
consumers in some ways because you know

560
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,120
we're not able to put everything we want

561
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,640
to put on there but we want to build out

562
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:36,839
the best products possible exactly I

563
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,720
appreciate you expanding on that one I

564
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:42,599
do want to get into humic acid next can

565
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,640
you talk to us about what is humic acid

566
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:46,558
what are the benefits reasoning why it

567
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,880
was uh added into stash blend and all

568
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,798
that stuff I mean humic acid has had a

569
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,200
big following for a long time right and

570
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,158
I think there's some serious synergies

571
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,400
when you add humix in with seaweeds and

572
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,400
with our polyamino and we we've done

573
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,159
other types of work and and released

574
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,519
other products of that that same sort of

575
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:06,360
synergy and hemic acid is that you know

576
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:08,319
if you if you look at at um its age it

577
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,240
was you know usually produced in the

578
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:12,558
Carboniferous era millions and millions

579
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,079
of years ago had we left it in the

580
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,000
ground it would have eventually turned

581
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,759
into coal but it hadn't gotten there yet

582
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,359
and you know it was produced in a time

583
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:23,000
period in our Earth with the carbon

584
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:24,918
content the carbon dioxide content was

585
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,240
exceptionally high so you have a lot of

586
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:30,320
carbon and you've got a lot of really

587
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,200
great really great complex carbon

588
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:34,918
sources that are part of humic acid so

589
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,159
you mine the human right and then you're

590
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,400
going to take the soluble low molecular

591
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:41,760
fraction off that that's fulvic acid

592
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,200
that will come off in the process and

593
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,879
then what's left is that higher

594
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,679
molecular weight

595
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,880
organic uh or carbon containing

596
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,240
compounds and a lot of times you'll

597
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,320
again you'll hear this again you're

598
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,278
using potassium hydroxide to create

599
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:59,558
soluble compounds from that mass right

600
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:01,640
and hemic acid we is actually mined down

601
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:03,558
in Florida it's produced here in the US

602
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,919
it's a really clean really beautiful

603
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:08,519
product but the thing I like about humic

604
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,759
acids is again it's a very complex High

605
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:12,558
molecular weight source of organic

606
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:14,759
carbon which is really great for biology

607
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:17,200
because the more complex you get in your

608
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:19,480
organic matter the more difficult it is

609
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,558
for the biology that we don't want to

610
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:25,679
feed to use it right uh you know the

611
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,519
harmful pathogenic biology that is so

612
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,240
we've got a great food source there very

613
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,839
complex but we've also got a really lot

614
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,839
of interesting secondary metabolite

615
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,359
compounds that come in with that humic

616
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,038
acid suit and I think it's hard for

617
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:39,798
people to put their fingers on exactly

618
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:41,798
what those compounds are aren't if you

619
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:43,720
run it through like high pressure liquid

620
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:46,119
chromatography and uh or mass

621
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,200
spectrometry right you can start to kind

622
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:50,199
of pick apart you know exactly what's in

623
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,120
there what's not some of them are kind

624
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,000
of unidentifiable some of them are but

625
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,918
what happens and what usually happens is

626
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,480
that good food source of bacteria and

627
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:01,679
biology but all so there's some nice

628
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,679
secondary metabolites that it sounds

629
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:07,240
wild to say this but have survived for

630
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,960
millions of years chemically intact and

631
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,558
you know have a response on plant growth

632
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,798
as well yeah hemic acid was something

633
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,720
that uh I didn't really even think of to

634
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,759
potentially add to stash blend but I

635
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,038
know that's something you you wanted to

636
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:22,158
put in there and I thought it was a

637
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:24,079
fantastic idea and yeah it definitely

638
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,039
works well in that mix I want to get

639
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:29,079
into silica next on the label you have

640
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,798
soluble silicon

641
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:33,960
silica I know it's a highly purified

642
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:36,119
silicon dioxide in there some parts are

643
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,200
soluble some parts are insoluble but

644
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,879
break it down for us all the details on

645
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:44,798
silica yeah it's it's that's a that's a

646
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,640
double duty mix right uh ingredient we

647
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,440
have it there functionally for the blend

648
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,440
itself because there's a lot of what we

649
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,320
call hygroscopic elements in there and

650
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,240
hygroscopic elements mean elements that

651
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:57,439
want compounds that want to pull in

652
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,519
water right so corn seep liquor is

653
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,200
really hygroscopic the polyaspartate

654
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:05,440
polymer is really hygroscopic right and

655
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,000
so the silica will actually do a really

656
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,960
great job of holding water as well and

657
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,839
so we wanted to try to kind of mitigate

658
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,640
some of the clumping issues that

659
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:16,759
consumers would have uh as much as we

660
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,960
could these really sensitive compounds

661
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:20,079
obviously we're not going to eliminate

662
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,480
everything but we wanted to include

663
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,439
silica in there as a mechanism that

664
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,839
would help absorb water a lot like you

665
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,840
would find in like silica packets right

666
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:30,879
and and food stuffs or things like that

667
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:32,959
where you're trying to absorb the water

668
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,640
and prevent uh your food from spoiling

669
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,840
or whatnot but beyond that you know we

670
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,679
said look this is going to work from a

671
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:42,759
functional perspective for the product

672
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:46,480
that's kind of an anti-clumping aid but

673
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:49,240
can this also be a silica source for

674
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,240
plants right because you know plants you

675
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,038
know you look at calcium deposition and

676
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,359
building walls and obviously it cross

677
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,158
links with Boron you know so you can't

678
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,199
have calci calcium deposition if you

679
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:02,399
don't have boron but you know silica

680
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,759
actually plays a really really big part

681
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:07,479
in in building out the scaffolding of

682
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:09,839
cells as well more of an exterior rather

683
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,038
than an interior component and I read an

684
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,038
article the other day where they were

685
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:16,599
actually considering making uh silicon

686
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:19,038
essential nutrient right that says hey

687
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:20,119
you need silica right which I thought

688
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:22,158
was really interesting because there's

689
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:24,918
always this debate of do you need silica

690
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,720
do you not need silica in my opinion you

691
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:28,840
know having silica is always always

692
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,120
going to help

693
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:34,119
now you know there's a lot of silica out

694
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:36,759
there in the world right and really what

695
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:39,519
it comes down to is available silica

696
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:42,119
right so that's why when you put it on

697
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:45,278
the label you can only put in what the

698
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:47,038
acid soluble silic fraction is because

699
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:48,880
that's what's available to the plant

700
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:50,038
because if we really wanted to put in a

701
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,480
bunch of silicon we could have put in

702
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:54,919
sand which is silicon dioxide right but

703
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,960
we all know Sand's not available to

704
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:58,360
plants you look at the particle size you

705
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,558
look at how that's going to break down

706
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:02,639
how it's going to react so what we do is

707
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:05,038
we start with a nanop particle silicon

708
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,640
dioxide it's been build down

709
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,359
exceptionally small when you say Nano

710
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,038
particle you're talking about nanometers

711
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:12,839
right uh exceptionally small size and so

712
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,879
that makes it a lot easier to react with

713
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:18,639
the biology react with the water sources

714
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,880
and create that acid soluble silica

715
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,720
that's then available to plant and

716
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,760
that's usually in a form of monic acid

717
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,480
or orthosilicic acid right and so it's

718
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:29,519
it's it's double duty you've got kind of

719
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,720
an anti-clumping a that's in the product

720
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,720
but you've also got the right form of

721
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,640
silicon the right size that's going to

722
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,720
be readily available to the plant as

723
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,679
well so that was that was a pretty cool

724
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,200
pretty cool thing we built in there and

725
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,399
correct me if I'm wrong the plant will

726
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,640
release acids microbes will release

727
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:47,879
acids that produce hydrogen ions they're

728
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:50,240
going to react and turn it into the

729
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,320
monosilicic and orisic acid is that

730
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,519
right there you go it's exactly right so

731
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,278
you've got a really small particle Nano

732
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:57,918
particle silicon dioxide you hook a

733
00:26:56,278 --> 00:26:58,798
hydrogen or a couple hydrogens up to

734
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,679
that

735
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:03,000
and uh introduce some water and Bobs

736
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:04,960
your uncle there you go and the pH is

737
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,880
totally impacted in the medium and I'd

738
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,200
like to kind of derail a little bit and

739
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,520
talk about pH in the medium because I

740
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,480
think a lot of folks are confused about

741
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,960
pH they think like okay the water source

742
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,519
that they mix in on the nutrients that

743
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,278
they mix up and adjust the pH on when

744
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,798
they water it in they're expecting that

745
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:23,398
that's what it is in the medium as well

746
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:25,679
and you know you've got a pH on the

747
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:28,000
medium then you also look at the risos

748
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,480
spere where it could be different uh but

749
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,200
the plant releases acids and microbes

750
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:37,200
release acids that change the pH can you

751
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,159
expand on that at all yeah I mean pH is

752
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,200
just that concentration between hydrogen

753
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:45,559
ions which are acidic and hydroxide ions

754
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:48,240
which are basic right and so you know

755
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:50,278
you've got inputs like your water source

756
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,440
you've got inputs like your fertilizer

757
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:54,919
sources and that are absolutely going to

758
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,480
play a bit of a role when it comes to

759
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:59,640
the pH of the soil right but really you

760
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,000
have that Bal bance of minerals that are

761
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,480
in the soil that are going to be the

762
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
ultimate dictators there and and and to

763
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,720
go A Step Beyond that a lot of what

764
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,240
happens is that it's really the plant

765
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,480
that's able to kind of help modify and

766
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,480
and its rizosphere and some plants are a

767
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,599
lot better at this in other plants right

768
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,480
just depends on genetics where they've

769
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:21,119
grown up naturally what kind of genetics

770
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,919
they're carrying if they've had to

771
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,558
modify their environment a lot of

772
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,519
tropical a lot of tropical plants grow

773
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:30,678
in very acidic soils they're very old

774
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:33,079
soils very weathered soils and so you

775
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:36,798
know those plants are Adept at releasing

776
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:39,599
hydroxide ions to buffer their ph up and

777
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:41,000
then you have other plants that uh you

778
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,359
know can grow in more alkaline

779
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,839
environments knowing that the soil needs

780
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:46,639
to be a little more acidic for them to

781
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:49,079
take up essential micronutrients like

782
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,640
iron or manganese or zinc for an example

783
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:52,918
and they're a lot better at releasing

784
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,679
hydroxide ions right that's going to

785
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:59,080
acidify that that rizosphere and acidify

786
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:02,360
that soil surface so uh a at the at the

787
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:05,678
roots and in the ball media but you know

788
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:08,719
really you know a lot of what happens in

789
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:12,038
this exchange between the roots and the

790
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,880
soil is that when a plant takes up uh

791
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:17,000
let's say a positively charged nutrient

792
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:20,120
like ammonium as an example it will

793
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,240
release a hydrogen to balance that right

794
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:24,759
because otherwise it' be acidifying

795
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:28,120
itself and that's why something like

796
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:33,240
ammonium sulfate as a nitrogen source

797
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:34,678
will reduce the pH in your soil right um

798
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,720
you know a lot of people use Elemental

799
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,559
sulfur to drop pH in soil and what

800
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,159
happens there is actually a chemical

801
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:43,759
reaction between the elemental sulfur

802
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:46,960
turning into sulfuric acid from a

803
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:48,919
biological reaction right so those are

804
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,079
some kind of examples but you know what

805
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:54,880
we did with with the stash blend it's a

806
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:56,158
very neutral blend very low use rate um

807
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,320
you know you're not going to see a lot

808
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,399
of pH differences when you use this

809
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:03,439
product right I mean it's it's a very

810
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:06,879
neutral product both in terms of its pH

811
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,440
of itself but also in and how it works

812
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,880
with the plant and taking up nutrients

813
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,720
it's there to assist the plant take up

814
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,840
nutrients in general you're going to

815
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,278
move the pH of the soil by adding in

816
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:18,439
things like calcium carbonate in bulk or

817
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:20,640
ammonium sulfate or Elemental sulfur in

818
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,600
bulk depending on you know what you're

819
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,480
growing and what you want to do great

820
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:26,918
points and I know I hear a lot of

821
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,798
organic Growers that uh often say they

822
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:31,480
don't pH their soil and they're like oh

823
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,519
yeah the biology in the medium is going

824
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,200
to take care of it and this is a perfect

825
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:36,720
example you explained in detail how that

826
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,000
can happen that plus the plants

827
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,919
releasing acids so really good info

828
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,720
there yeah now you have a lot of

829
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:46,200
knowledge on bacteria as well so

830
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:49,000
bacteria there's a Consortium of

831
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,960
bacteria in stash blend there's a billus

832
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,839
Lin formis billus pelli billus subtilus

833
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:58,639
and then a Pam basilis Asos fixen which

834
00:30:54,839 --> 00:31:00,319
I probably butchered all of those names

835
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:03,038
you know it came close right yeah you

836
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:05,678
can't really close break it down for us

837
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:09,679
all about bacteria you know what those

838
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:11,919
particular species do for plant Health

839
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,600
yeah I think when you look at that mix

840
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,480
right and simple Google searches will

841
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,038
tell you you know specifically what each

842
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,079
one of those do and I think In fairness

843
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:20,519
of time without going too far down a

844
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:22,079
rabbit hole I don't think I'll address

845
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:24,278
you know each one of them and it's in

846
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:27,119
this particular but you have that genus

847
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:28,440
and species that identifies what what

848
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,759
you have right

849
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,038
but it's not quite that simple because

850
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:35,720
then you have different

851
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:39,200
strains of those genus and species right

852
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:42,558
and so each different strain of a basil

853
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,319
a subtilus example um is going to work a

854
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:46,960
little bit differently from one strain

855
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:49,000
to the next and so what we've identified

856
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,278
over a course of time and and through a

857
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,398
fermentative process is a strain of

858
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:56,839
Select individuals that will do

859
00:31:55,398 --> 00:31:58,959
primarily two things is what we're

860
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:01,519
trying to accomplish one is just overall

861
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,480
plan Health right and guarding that

862
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,839
risos spere and uh and giving those

863
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,120
molecular signals to the plant and out

864
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,959
competing the pathogenic bacteria that

865
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:13,239
might be in a soil and then the other is

866
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,960
nutrient uptake and usually what we're

867
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,798
looking at there is just kind of overall

868
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,840
from an enzymatic perspective but also

869
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:22,599
uh in in particular from a nitrogen

870
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:24,480
uptake perspective as well and you know

871
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:26,079
if you look at the stash BL I know we've

872
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,720
talked about you know individual

873
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:30,119
ingredients right and and kind of on

874
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,960
their own I think every one of the

875
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:34,599
ingredients on their own has real Merit

876
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,880
right I think it's going to absolutely

877
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:38,638
help you in your growth but I think in

878
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,559
the format that we have them the

879
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:43,519
specific species that we built out in

880
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:45,839
our biology the amino acid polymer the

881
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:49,480
humic of seaweeds a food source in form

882
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:51,959
of corn steep liquor that Synergy of

883
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,839
ingredients that we've tied in you know

884
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,200
across multiple continents of raw

885
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:59,038
materials and brought into one bag you

886
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,519
know I think that's that's where that

887
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:03,839
special performance really comes into

888
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,440
when you use those things and synergies

889
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:07,918
um and so the biology is you know

890
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,399
obviously a big part of that that it is

891
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,960
lyophilized it's freeze dried onto a

892
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:15,719
sugar based substrate and uh when it

893
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,880
gets into water that uh the signal to

894
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,679
the biolog is hey we've got water again

895
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,320
uh let's rock and roll and and the

896
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:24,559
reason we use a sugar- based substrate

897
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,879
so the the the there's a hency with

898
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:28,599
those sugars right so the cells don't

899
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,080
dry out when you're going through that

900
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:32,439
lyophilization process and

901
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:34,879
lyophilization is freeze drying by the

902
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,840
way so you can spray dry with heat or

903
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,559
you can freeze dry uh using cold

904
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:43,398
temperatures and uh at that point in

905
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:45,759
time it's more kind of an evaporation

906
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:50,119
sulation if you go from a freezing to a

907
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:51,960
gas um but it's a lot more gentle when

908
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:53,359
it comes to the survival of the species

909
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:57,360
and using those

910
00:33:53,359 --> 00:34:01,000
Hants um those osmolytes or are how we

911
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:02,439
how we preserve the uh the bacteria I

912
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,919
think the species that intrigues me the

913
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,278
most is the Pam basilis azos fictions

914
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:09,480
because it's nitrogen fixing bacteria

915
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:12,358
just it blows my mind that they're able

916
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,159
to grab nitrogen from the air and

917
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:16,159
convert into a form that the plant can

918
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,720
uptake I thought that was so cool yeah

919
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,760
it is really neat and there's more of

920
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:21,439
that coming right I mean I think even in

921
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,960
R crop if you look at some of the

922
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,320
companies that are out there some of the

923
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,918
startup companies um there's gaining

924
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,800
traction where they're they're putting

925
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:34,078
these specific species and strains of

926
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,960
biology down to help bring in nitrogen

927
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,679
and they're they they know predictably

928
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,918
that you can reduce your your synthetic

929
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,079
nitrogen inputs by X number of pounds

930
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,719
per acre when they do that and that's

931
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,720
that's neat and we need we need more of

932
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:48,799
that by the way because there's an

933
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:50,078
incredible amount of emissions uh that

934
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,000
are that are offut during that

935
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,159
manufacturing of fertilizer as you know

936
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,878
and and the industry is not resting on

937
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,320
its Laurels I think people are actively

938
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:01,039
trying to figure out

939
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,640
a a Hab Bosch process where you can fix

940
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:06,519
nitren from the air you know using

941
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:10,159
sustainable uh electricity and and and

942
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:13,400
with reduced pressures and reduced heat

943
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:15,639
and um we're not there yet obviously but

944
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,960
you know that's that's a process that's

945
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:21,039
you know 100 years old and uh it needs

946
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,079
some updating but attacking it from the

947
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:26,119
biological side you know to me yeah yes

948
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,440
please let let's see more of that yeah

949
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:30,160
if it can be sustainable and not cause

950
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,440
harm to the environment that would be

951
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:36,239
fantastic yeah now next to really on any

952
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,720
micro product you should see a

953
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:42,838
cfu SLG which stands for Colony forming

954
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:44,000
units per gram can you kind of talk to

955
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:46,078
us a little bit about it like what does

956
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,599
that actually mean what are some

957
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,280
reasonable amounts uh yeah I mean

958
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:52,599
reasonable amounts are going to be you

959
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,800
know depending on use rates right at the

960
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:55,559
end of the day and depending on the

961
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,359
species themselves how well do they

962
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:58,920
colonize you know how are they going to

963
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:02,279
out compete other

964
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,440
organisms um you know the colony forming

965
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,440
units per gram is just a way to to

966
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,559
recognize what's the what's the density

967
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:12,838
of viable uh viable living organisms if

968
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,838
you put it in in one gram it's just it's

969
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,639
just a way to measure how many viable

970
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:18,480
living organisms you actually have and

971
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:19,559
that's third party certified by the way

972
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,639
I mean we've got to send out to the

973
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:24,078
third party lab they've got to they've

974
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:25,639
got to grow uh the species on the pet

975
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,839
tree dish and be able to measure that

976
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:30,239
for us and give us a number for to be

977
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:31,920
able to put that on on the bag and

978
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,239
that's also why the bag has an

979
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,280
expiration date even though since it's

980
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:38,959
completely dry you know the expiration

981
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,680
dat is kind of something that's legally

982
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,639
we have to put on there but I think you

983
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:47,279
know it's U not something that I think

984
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:49,199
goes bad in the insiration date but um

985
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,880
yeah it's just a way to be able to

986
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:54,000
express at the end of the day how many

987
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,119
living viable units you have and mean

988
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,280
you'll see 10 to six 10 to seven 10 to

989
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:00,000
eight that's a million you know two

990
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,880
million 100 million billion you know

991
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,318
when you get a 10 to the nth right um

992
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,160
you know anything around those numbers

993
00:37:04,318 --> 00:37:08,559
10 to fifth even depending on the

994
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:10,838
species you know you get into really low

995
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:13,078
counts you know you wonder sometimes if

996
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:15,719
there's more you know Sizzle than steak

997
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:18,119
but um I think to me it's just

998
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:18,959
trusting uh what you see with a plant

999
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:21,559
right if you're going to use the

1000
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,400
biological product you know what do you

1001
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:26,078
see from it do do you see benefits do

1002
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:29,358
you not are you putting it in um you

1003
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,119
know a uh media that is is fairly

1004
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:32,880
sterile you know because you're going to

1005
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,000
see probably different things from that

1006
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,358
are you putting it out there in a in a

1007
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,639
composted outdoor environment that's

1008
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:42,639
teeming with Biology right I think

1009
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:44,318
there's some you know are you going into

1010
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,279
an into a situation where there was

1011
00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:47,000
steam sterilization in the soil and

1012
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,000
you're

1013
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,880
rebuilding um you know let let your eye

1014
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,679
and let your yield indicators tell you

1015
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,480
uh whether a biological product or

1016
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,679
biologically based product or prodct

1017
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,280
contains biology is doing what you want

1018
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:05,159
it to do rather than how many Colony

1019
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:08,200
forming units is printed on the bag got

1020
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:10,879
it and I see next to the bacteria it's

1021
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:14,960
col Colony forming units but next to the

1022
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:18,280
endom micro it's prop SLG what does that

1023
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,679
mean yeah it's just propagules right so

1024
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,800
that's that's just another way to

1025
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:24,639
measure you're dealing with a different

1026
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,720
organism obviously um you know when you

1027
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:29,199
when you go from bacteria to fungi so

1028
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:31,318
it's how those are measured and you know

1029
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:33,639
micro isy are difficult because I don't

1030
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:35,639
think there is as much consensus out

1031
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:36,960
there in the laboratory methods to

1032
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:39,078
measure those I think they're a lot

1033
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,720
harder to measure uh at the end of the

1034
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:43,839
day and I think for me it's about taking

1035
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:48,559
reputable Partners when it comes to uh

1036
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:50,719
mic rizy and um you know but that's

1037
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:53,799
that's the same sort that's analogous to

1038
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:56,919
cfus is uh you know how much how much

1039
00:38:53,800 --> 00:39:00,039
can you can you propagate and uh from

1040
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:03,358
that from that uh input there okay so

1041
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:05,599
Endo microz that's in stash blend

1042
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:08,318
there's four different species of glomus

1043
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,640
in here I won't try to butcher the four

1044
00:39:08,318 --> 00:39:13,039
different ones

1045
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:14,879
there it well inter interes is the most

1046
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:17,960
important one no doubt I mean you look

1047
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,000
at endom micro and what and what it does

1048
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,199
the the vast majority of research that

1049
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,318
that you'll find out there is on

1050
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:27,078
intereses and it's it's a heavy lifter

1051
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:30,039
but the Endo uh package that we use was

1052
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:32,480
was specifically built out to be water

1053
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:35,838
soluble um to be able to be run through

1054
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,679
irrigation to be used in in large scale

1055
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:41,599
you know Greenhouse grows as an example

1056
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:43,399
and um all the micro isal packages out

1057
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,760
there micro isal suppliers we could work

1058
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:49,079
with um that that to me was and it was

1059
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:52,079
fairly new iteration too a fairly new

1060
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:54,119
new launch um and that's why we we built

1061
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,240
that one into there and mic risel fungi

1062
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:58,480
has so many benefits can you just give

1063
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:00,559
you want to give us a quick rundown

1064
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,358
well I think you know I think it's it's

1065
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:04,838
one of the more classic examples of you

1066
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:06,519
know an excellent symbiotic relationship

1067
00:40:04,838 --> 00:40:08,000
where you have you know the endom

1068
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:10,559
microid that they're actually moving

1069
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,599
into the vascular system of the plant

1070
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:15,759
and extending out a Ty into the soil and

1071
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,318
you're magnifying the plant's going to

1072
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,800
give up a little energy to do that so

1073
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:22,079
it's it's a tradeoff uh but what you're

1074
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,000
doing is you're magnifying the the root

1075
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,599
system of the plant basically when you

1076
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,280
do that so the plants you your your

1077
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:31,920
nutrient uptake is is is to find root

1078
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,319
hairs not your structural larger roots

1079
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,240
that have been lignified but it's the

1080
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:38,039
root hairs that um that do that and so

1081
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:40,279
those root hairs will Slough off and die

1082
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:42,838
and and continue to reproduce and and

1083
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,000
grow and so you know you have the plant

1084
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:47,639
taking up nutrients to its root hairs

1085
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,358
but then you have also uh these micro

1086
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:51,078
rizy these endom micro rizy that are

1087
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:54,239
growing into the vascular system of the

1088
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:56,720
plant and tying in directly and they're

1089
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,959
growing out their High Fe and so in

1090
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:00,480
parallel kind of there root hair uptake

1091
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,679
now you have the ability to take up

1092
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,480
nutrients through the micro rizy as well

1093
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:07,679
and uh it's a it's a great great

1094
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,119
symbiotic relationship awesome yeah I

1095
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:12,078
know you hear a lot of it uh has with

1096
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:14,760
phosphorus how it really helps like

1097
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,839
unlock phosphorus make it more available

1098
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,800
and and be able to transport it and all

1099
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:20,559
that stuff so yeah and you hear that

1100
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,000
because phosphorus is you fairly Mobile

1101
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,239
in the soil right so it's all about

1102
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
route interception and so when you're

1103
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:28,799
able to expand you know your either real

1104
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,679
rot system or your borrow root system

1105
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:35,519
from micro rizy your odds of stumbling

1106
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:36,838
across uh nutrients uh improves greatly

1107
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:38,838
you know at the end of the day and then

1108
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:40,880
you build in your poly aspirate in there

1109
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:43,759
which helps with phosphorus you build in

1110
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,440
your bacteria you the micro rizy and and

1111
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,440
if you think about it it it's a um it's

1112
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,039
it's more of a longer term play right

1113
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,880
the bacteria can move in the soil and

1114
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:53,559
can start working the other elements

1115
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,838
that we have in the stash blend can move

1116
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:57,440
into soil and start working right away

1117
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:59,000
right but the micro Riza you know

1118
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,119
they've got to infiltrate into the roots

1119
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,679
they've got to grow out their root

1120
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:04,358
system so that's more of a a a longer

1121
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:07,559
term play and while you're having this

1122
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:10,719
turnover all your wonderful you know uh

1123
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:12,759
uh biological compounds and and bacteria

1124
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:14,639
that's in that so unfortunately at this

1125
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,880
point George's connection dropped being

1126
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:18,879
on the road it's just me here now and I

1127
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,559
wanted to close out this episode so

1128
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,358
first off big thanks to George for

1129
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:23,480
coming on to the podcast like I

1130
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:25,279
mentioned in the beginning of the

1131
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,679
episode George is the formulation

1132
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,599
chemist for both Ventana PL science and

1133
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,440
stash blend so I have links to those

1134
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,838
products down in the YouTube description

1135
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,599
section below also link the from the

1136
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:37,239
stash episode that we did with him

1137
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,440
awesome awesome episode there I

1138
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:41,639
recommend all of you go to that episode

1139
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,159
after this one as far as social media

1140
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:46,239
George isn't really on social media and

1141
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:48,679
he likes his personal time so there'll

1142
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:51,679
be no social media links for him or ways

1143
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:54,279
for you to contact him but if you

1144
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:55,879
comment down below and mention part two

1145
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,599
if we get enough of them maybe I can

1146
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,160
have him come on again in the future

1147
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,960
also list any questions that you may

1148
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:02,920
have for George down in the comment

1149
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,880
section below and if I'm able to get him

1150
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,800

1151
