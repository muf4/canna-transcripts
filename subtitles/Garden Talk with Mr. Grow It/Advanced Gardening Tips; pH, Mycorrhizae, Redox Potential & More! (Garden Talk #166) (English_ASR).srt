00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,758
to be honest with you you're one of the

56
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,879
more advanced folks it's taken me a

57
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,359
while to kind of build some knowledge

58
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:05,118
that I'll be able to ask you some more

59
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,000
advanced questions I feel like because

60
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:10,280
you do have just a huge like very

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,439
extensive background when it comes to

62
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,680
not only teaching but being an author

63
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:16,359
educator we're going to get into that

64
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,319
we'll do an introduction here but after

65
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,480
that I'm just going to fire away some I

66
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,079
say difficult questions but we'll we'll

67
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,759
we'll get you some uh decent questions

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,000
here that are going to make you think I

69
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,318
hope heck yeah can you introduce

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,479
yourself maybe just tell us a little bit

71
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:31,799
about yourself and how you got into

72
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:34,598
gardening yeah so I for many of us in

73
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,000
this space uh John Kemp when I recently

74
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:40,439
interviewed him uh he said this and I

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,919
completely resonated with it is that

76
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:46,560
many of us got into this because of

77
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:49,318
Health crisis I have Crohn's and I

78
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,158
started trying to eat better uh I

79
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:54,679
discovered like organic and stuff right

80
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:59,598
around the time period when I met my

81
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,680
wife uh and I was I was 131 lb I'm

82
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:05,798
almost almost 180 lb just give you an

83
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,519
idea I'm 6 almost 6'2 so it was 130 lb

84
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:13,799
uh I couldn't really hold on to any

85
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:16,840
muscle uh no fat and my wife also got

86
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,400
cancer uh second year into our marriage

87
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,719
and when our our firstborn was 1 years

88
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:26,439
old and food was the thing I could

89
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:29,039
control cuz the doctors were were liars

90
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,158
and they caused more cancer than they

91
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,560
than than they didn't solve anything

92
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:38,079
they cut things out uh and then they

93
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,640
created more cancer and so it was a real

94
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,599
difficult time because I didn't know

95
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:44,318
what I could do I started trying to do

96
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:47,199
the Gerson Therapy and then I just

97
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,878
tapped out financially and mentally and

98
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,759
cuz I was the person doing the juicing

99
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,039
and the like like removing the fibers

100
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,878
from the food

101
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:56,639
and two years of that I went crazy uh my

102
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:57,919
wife was like please stop you know

103
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,438
you're stressing me out more than I

104
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:04,559
think it's helping uh and and and so I

105
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:07,199
started gardening but it was 140Â°

106
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,598
soils you know I'm in the Foothills

107
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:13,598
above Fresno so a bare soil in 112

108
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:15,359
degree ambient compounds so I thought I

109
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,199
was crazy for gardening I felt like I

110
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,680
had a choice and so I started gardening

111
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,120
the initial year before the animals

112
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,439
found it looked really good and then the

113
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,280
second year they all found it and

114
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,079
destroyed it and then my father-in-law

115
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,719
brought

116
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,800
in uh bull manure that wasn't finished

117
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,840
so it all turned into we seeds and then

118
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,960
great vegetative

119
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:38,719
overgrowth so it was like like a huge

120
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:41,959
amount of trial and error and it was all

121
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,440
motivated by getting my kids safe food

122
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:46,560
and my wife food that can actually heal

123
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:50,519
and nourish her and also food that I

124
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,959
could eat so we really were

125
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:56,240
bound and and had really these

126
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:59,198
strictures on our life that forced us

127
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,038
into this in many ways but we feel

128
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,038
really blessed uh and retrospect because

129
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:06,879
we made all these choices really early

130
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:08,399
on with our kids and our own health and

131
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,759
our own marriage you know we because of

132
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,120
our health issues we decided to have

133
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,720
kids early turning 43 this year and uh I

134
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,120
have an 18-year-old and a 14-year-old

135
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:22,639
right so so we made these decisions and

136
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,639
gardening was one of them and it's just

137
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,800
a a fundamental foundational piece of

138
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,800
our lives and and yeah it all started

139
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,400
with the health thing incredible yeah

140
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,240
I've heard that story that you've

141
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,839
mentioned uh in other videos that you

142
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,240
filmed you have a really extensive

143
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,359

144
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,199

description section below one of the

147
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:48,399
things I know you for most I feel like

148
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,000
is the book this regenerative soil book

149
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,359
this is my go-to if anybody is looking

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,959
for an advanced type book highly

151
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,560
recommend this book it is uh definitely

152
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:00,399

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,080
my 23rd book in the permaculture

160
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,918
gardening era of my writing I wrote

161
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,000
science fiction books before I wrote

162
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:26,079
visual music theory books for

163
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,360
guitarists and and even before all that

164
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,120
in high school I wrote like fantasy

165
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,199
books I never finished but but I've been

166
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,720
writing and trying to figure this out

167
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,840
and trying to serve and and you know do

168
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,680
all these things as a writer the whole

169
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,079
time and so a lot of people see the

170
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,720
success of that book and they're like

171
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:48,519
holy cow and I'm like yeah that's I'm 10

172
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,360
years in that's my 23rd book there's a

173
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:55,359
reason kept hitting and hitting until it

174
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,038
broke through you know so so yeah no it

175
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,439
definitely was uh an incredible journey

176
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:03,038
to to get there

177
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:07,240
and then it was wild because I wrote

178
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:09,680
that book for gardeners for Growers and

179
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,478
then John Kemp really kind of leaned on

180
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,800
me to make it more for

181
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:15,359
farmers and so I was like oh yeah I can

182
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,360
figure out how to generalize and jump

183
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,560
out and like then have it go to scale

184
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,000
and

185
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,399
bulk and when I did that I didn't

186
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,478
realize the impact it would have and how

187
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,439
because I stretched the the context from

188
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,478
small scale to large scale and then went

189
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:33,240
from micro to macro

190
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,800
how much it would help people and

191
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,519
because I've got my own interpretation

192
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:42,240
in its nature I'm looking at other

193
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,359
people saw other things in it than I saw

194
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,038
because I'm simply showcasing nature and

195
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,919
and so it it went beyond

196
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:53,158
me and so because I focused so much on

197
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:55,279
just showcasing nature it allowed people

198
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:56,680
to go deeper than even I I learned from

199
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,478
my students I learned from these other

200
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:04,240
farmers who were using it and applying

201
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:06,439
it and it's been this wild gift not just

202
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,120
to to me and my life cuz it's a it's a

203
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:12,240
bestselling top selling book uh but also

204
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,038
to everyone that has has reached and

205
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,400
touched and where they've been been able

206
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:19,839
to apply it so so yeah no I just want to

207
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:23,318
give context so that it's it it was so

208
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:26,000
much like led up to that moment and and

209
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,639
it in it had this power that transcended

210
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
so much of what I was doing and and

211
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,560
hoping to do

212
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,038
and so it just uh it's just a wonderful

213
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,958
thing a wonderful thing that happened

214
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,479
it's an incredible book and I talk about

215
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,199
it all the time in my content and I

216
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,879
refer people to it all the time because

217
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,519
it is really that good and uh I'll

218
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,039
probably have a link to it down in the

219
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,480
description section below so people can

220
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:50,079
easily get to it and check it out but

221
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,039
yeah let's get into some gardening

222
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,399
topics so I have a wide variety of folks

223
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:58,319
in here as far as experience levels so I

224
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,720
got a lot of beginners intermediate

225
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,680
probably less advanced to folks on here

226
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,278
but yeah I just want to give you a heads

227
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,039
up on that right off the bat so you're

228
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:08,679
aware who the audience is I want to

229
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:11,360
start off with ph so we know that the pH

230
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:13,399
in the rizosphere can be two points

231
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,480
different than the pH in the medium so

232
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,759
for example if it's 6.5 pH the

233
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,120
rizosphere could actually be 8.5 pH or

234
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:24,120
be 5.5 pH so because of that many people

235
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,639
are completely ignoring pH talk to us

236
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,000
about pH and do you recommend pH

237
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,480
measurements or not okay so I totally

238
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,879
recommend pH measurements what you have

239
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:39,120
to recognize is that they expend energy

240
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:41,278
to do that so the energy is protons from

241
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,720
photosynthesis that are used to change

242
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:47,039
the

243
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,079
pH right and so they're expending energy

244
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:52,240
so the closer you are to the Goldilocks

245
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:54,599
range around that route the more energy

246
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,480
you can dedicate to other

247
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,680
things and those protons can then go to

248
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,159
releasing more nutrients releasing more

249
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,679
things and also energizing the microbes

250
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,759
the other thing to think about is the

251
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,879
roots the root Marist stem cells which

252
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:11,919
are the tip of the root that's the most

253
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:15,639
acidic point and then as the root ages

254
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:18,639
it becomes more and more

255
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:20,639
alkaline so so the tip is is the most

256
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:24,559
acidic and then it's more alkaline as it

257
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:27,480
goes and so you get a gradient

258
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:30,639
effect and what happens essentially

259
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,039
is the tip is where everything happens

260
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:37,039
so your your root is boring through the

261
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:39,679
soil and it's actually seeking nutrients

262
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:41,120
and in microbes like hunting that's why

263
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,039
it does its whole Behavior it's

264
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,159
following the path of lease resistance

265
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:48,879
following water Pathways nutrient

266
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:51,480
Pathways and it's breeding microbes

267
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:53,439
sucking them in and removing their

268
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,120
nutrition and then pushing the remaining

269
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,240
microbes that survived this process

270
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,720
out or they're staying in cuz they're

271
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,120
endites and they can just release

272
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,160
nitrogen to hang

273
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,600
out while it's doing that it's releasing

274
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:09,319
all this this energy and it's acidifying

275
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,480
it absolutely but it's causing a

276
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,560
nutrient release because it's a

277
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,039
differential so it's like yeah it's two

278
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:17,399
points different so what's that going to

279
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:20,078
do it's going to release the nutrients

280
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:23,839
that are held there comfortably in that

281
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:25,479
pH now not not because you lower the ph

282
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,720
it's loosening things up and releasing

283
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:32,600
them you have a depletion Zone following

284
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,639
that tip there's like a wake of

285
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,720
depletion this is where micro risal

286
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,480
fungi when partnering it sends its Hy

287
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,879
out past the depletion Zone and gets

288
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,959
more nutrients this is why partnering

289
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:46,759
with it expands the the actual root Zone

290
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:51,039
we talk about we talk about it makes it

291
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:53,039
more surface area it's expanding past

292
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:56,360
that depletion Zone and and sucking in

293
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,639
more nutrients um and then transforming

294
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,000
them and bringing them directly to the

295
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,360
root so

296
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,600
and that also changes the pH

297
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:08,200
relationships further down so if you

298
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,759
don't have a micro risal relationship

299
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,480
the gradient is going to be much more

300
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:15,679
severe but if you do it's going to be

301
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,440
less so because it's still going to be

302
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,439
able to reach past that Deion Zone and

303
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,800
it's still going to be able to to

304
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,040
release digestive

305
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:28,958
enzymes and and and and and solubilize

306
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:31,198
nutrients and bring them in and so it's

307
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:35,278
a a little bit more complicated you know

308
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:38,519
of a space than people have you know the

309
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:40,360
problem is folks don't think about time

310
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,919
and they don't think in three dimensions

311
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,680
and they don't think about stacking

312
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,719
effects so people talk about like oh

313
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:48,278
it's

314
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,440
chemical in part but there's also

315
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:53,600
biological things happening and there's

316
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,040
also electrical things happening and so

317
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,240
all these things are happening all at

318
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,559
the same

319
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,480
time and so it's hard for people to

320
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,958
visualize

321
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,240
and so that's why I draw so many

322
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:05,518
pictures and that's why I separate it

323
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,680
and then I put it together in my

324
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,120
teaching so that people recognize that

325
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,838
oh this is all happening in the same

326
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,560
time or like the soil food web

327
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,720
conception where there's like microbial

328
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:19,239
manures and then they get eaten by the

329
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,199
plant that doesn't happen like that's

330
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,000
not happening instantly that happens

331
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:26,759
over time and the manur build up in the

332
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,480
soil so that when the root arrives and

333
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:33,399
depletes that zone it gets those manures

334
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,560
so again time that's like a huge span of

335
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:37,759
time we're talking about maybe years to

336
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,359
build up that

337
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,399
effect um so that it's

338
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,320
noticeable and then we've got things

339
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,399
that are happening sandwich right on top

340
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,360
of each other you know what I mean

341
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,519
so just like rise of fasi is happening

342
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,680
and micro risal fungi can be doing its

343
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:58,399
thing at the same time which is to a lot

344
00:13:54,679 --> 00:14:01,278
of people are like but but how you know

345
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,958
um yeah yeah they they they allow things

346
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:06,078
to flow through themselves uh and it's

347
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:12,239
it's it's remarkable and it's actually

348
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:14,879
uh visible you can see it so so Roots

349
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,560
they acidify they're releasing we have

350
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,679
to remember that it's an it's a release

351
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:22,758
of energy they're creating a

352
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:25,559
differential but they also can create

353
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:27,600
that differential with a lot less effort

354
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:31,359
if you're closer to the goldilock

355
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,040
zone and and and the goldilock zone you

356
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,560
know depending on your plant type could

357
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,559
be very different blueberries are going

358
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,439
to be way more acidic than your corn and

359
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:42,638
and that's going to be way more acidic

360
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,680
than your you know beets right and so

361
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,320
you need to know your goldilock zone for

362
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:49,638
what you're planting or you plant in a

363
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,320
mix and know that some of these things

364
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:55,680
are

365
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:57,120
simply uh hormesis hormetic stress in

366
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,838
other words like when we work out we're

367
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,560
stressing the body but it makes us

368
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:03,480
strong stronger but if you work too much

369
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,879
way to be like ripping and hurtful you

370
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,519
know there's a there's a right level of

371
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:10,399
stress cuz we need that

372
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,600
differentiation and so I Do cover crops

373
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,320
and I mix in some things like amaranth I

374
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,278
mix in some things like

375
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,360
brasas and I also have nitrogen fixers

376
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:22,039
and more and more evidence shows that

377
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,199
just doing nitrogen fixers a whole field

378
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:29,000
of nitrogen fixers not a good

379
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:31,278
idea so so that mixture that that I

380
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,639
created this mix called the five cousins

381
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:36,480
because they kind of all like Bully each

382
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:39,120
other a little bit like cousins do and

383
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,319
it's like that's good for the soil you

384
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,799
know what I mean and it's like the the

385
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:45,639
you know the buckwheat stealing nitrogen

386
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:48,559
from the cow peas and the cow peas are

387
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,759
going past their normal expression of

388
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:53,359
nitrogen fixation to this genetic full

389
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:56,879
potential because they're like it's not

390
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:00,159
piling up properly and so you get this

391
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:02,240
push and pull you know uh daon ratus

392
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:04,240
Sops up all the available nitrogen in

393
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,000
the soil so that the cies are like

394
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,600
there's nothing here and then they're

395
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,799
like going extra hard and so we can

396
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,560
create those kinds of antagonisms and

397
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:16,000
differentiation and all those kinds of

398
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:18,799
things to stimulate things to a

399
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,720
degree but we also have to make things

400
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,359
as easy as possible for the plants cuz

401
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,639
when the plants have

402
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,519
discretion and they have excess funds

403
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,399
they invest them so what do I mean by

404
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,198
that well they create those chirpings

405
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,198
they create those they create the smell

406
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:41,240
taste they create all the things that we

407
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:44,758
love and associate with food are only

408
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:47,240
created at that like abundance level at

409
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,159
that oh everything else is taken care of

410
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,759
now we're going to taste good everything

411
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:53,000
else is taken care of now we're going to

412
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:57,560
smell good and that's where all the

413
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,759
medicinal qualities happen too and so we

414
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:03,359
really need to recog recognize that the

415
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,439
next stage of our growing of making food

416
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,318
into Medicine of regenerative egg is

417
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,199
getting to that place where we're not

418
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:13,038
stressing plants out past their ability

419
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,679
we're stressing them out just enough so

420
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,798
that they're like H immune system on you

421
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,240
know they're like we're going to trigger

422
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:23,679
you know their immune system like ISR

423
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,720
right and and we can do that with just

424
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,240
applying microbes that are that are

425
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,600
beneficial so it's like the right kind

426
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,599
of Strat

427
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,678
is an

428
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,199
Endy that it's already inside it to a

429
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,798
small degree but now we amped it up and

430
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,400
so it's at a beneficial degree it's like

431
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:43,000
probiotics you know for plants but it

432
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,320
triggers them and so it's in that

433
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,038
goldilock zone of

434
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:52,759
stress so I I I really I really value

435
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:55,038
all these paradigms I do test for pH

436
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:57,558
even though it's a it's an

437
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:59,279
average it's you're going to have pH

438
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:02,599
jump four to nine in most most healthy

439
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,200
soils like micr meter to micrometer but

440
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:07,119
it's we're always taking

441
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,360
averages uh and and and I always do that

442
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:12,359
that gives us a really good window and

443
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,439
then when you're looking at at your

444
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,959
tests and you got your parts per million

445
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,840
or you have you know even even your

446
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,919
microbes and your biological testing the

447
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:25,599
pH gives you so much context and then

448
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:28,799
reference point so you may not test for

449
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:31,759
redo but if you know what it is you know

450
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,798
know that it's drier or wetter right and

451
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,359
so you could be like wow this nutrient

452
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:39,759
is being locked out it's in the soil I

453
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:43,479
added it and the plant's not getting

454
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:49,158
it oh man I think we need to water

455
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:52,000
more or oh is the intern watering too

456
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:55,679
much because they usually

457
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,558
do too much and so and so you you can

458
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,038
track these things down when you have

459
00:18:57,558 --> 00:19:01,359
the understanding and pH isn't

460
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:03,960
everything like I said you got to think

461
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:07,240
eh too to know what's missing why when

462
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:10,759
things don't add up and then pH is also

463
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:14,359
contextual for instance if you are doing

464
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:18,240
compost and it's hot compost please pH

465
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:22,798
test it you're going to go oh it's

466
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:25,599
ph8 huh that's very high in nitrates huh

467
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:27,319
well just slow down for a second because

468
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,439
no one was testing this until I started

469
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:31,158
bringing this up and and they're adding

470
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,720
it and so they're maybe they're at

471
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:34,960
they're in California they're already pH

472
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,400
7.5 do you think adding ph8 is going to

473
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,319
help

474
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,480
no no and they're like most of my Gess

475
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:45,960
has 50%

476
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,880
compost and it's like you know they just

477
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,400
shifted their whole garden up to pH 7.8

478
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,080
and now everyone's unhappy you know and

479
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,400
they're locking out all the nutrients

480
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:58,079
and the nutrients are there but it's

481
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,880
alkaline and oxidized so it's locked out

482
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:03,480
so it's like really critical to have

483
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,000
these things in our in our knowledge so

484
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,679
that we can evaluate things in a way

485
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,759
that actually serves our comprehension

486
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:13,240
most of what I teach is allowing people

487
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:15,480
to see things as they actually are for

488
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:19,480
themselves in such a way that you don't

489
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,919
trust me bro stuff instead it's like if

490
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,360
you see this you know then test and you

491
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,880
can see and like you can actually prove

492
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:29,479
it to yourself and it's like not me

493
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,880
imposing not us imposing in it's us

494
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,000
asking questions that lead to answers

495
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,919
that we can then test and

496
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,798
verify and and that that has been the

497
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,400
like the the turning point for me in

498
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:44,119
many ways and that's why this book I

499
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,720
think is so valuable because we

500
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:49,038
co-create the future together as people

501
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,319
read this because they can see and test

502
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:54,798
and see it for themselves and then make

503
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:58,038
decisions based upon what they know

504
00:20:54,798 --> 00:21:00,119
now so it's been it's been awesome and

505
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:02,720
and the the database that I'm creating

506
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:05,399
now is so that people can see all these

507
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,240
things in the open because before people

508
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,000
take actions they take a test and well

509
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,038
all right well people take a test at the

510
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,240
beginning of the season they take the

511
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,079
action then they eat the thing at the

512
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,720
end of the season and go we did it and

513
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,480
they don't test anything else right I

514
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,038
want to do before and after testing with

515
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,798
the actions in the middle so that we can

516
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:25,038
see what you added when you added it in

517
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,038
your methodology in reference to what

518
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,720
happened before and afterwards and then

519
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:31,640
have that be ubiquitous so that

520
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,079
gardeners Market gardeners small farmers

521
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,880
midsize and large scale farmers can see

522
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,558
the gradient of

523
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,360
expression and they can see also like

524
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:41,839
they can kind of see the future too

525
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:43,959
they're like looking at the market

526
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,199
gardeners applying regenerative methods

527
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,240
that they haven't figured out how to

528
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,200
scale yet and they're like H and the

529
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,720
people who figure that out will be and

530
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,519
that's viral I want things to become

531
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,679
viral uh and it it really goes back to

532
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:01,839
just a simple idea that when we have

533
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:04,519
have enough information and we look

534
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:07,038
through the lens of

535
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:09,440
nature Things become self-evident and

536
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:12,480
people make really good decisions uh

537
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,120
because people then are empowered and um

538
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,798
when people have the right people have

539
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:18,119
the right lenses and ability to

540
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:19,839
critically think and the right

541
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:22,079
information sets they make really good

542
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:25,918
decisions and that's always been my

543
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:28,079
experience so so that's what I'm doing

544
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,440
um I'm really trying to stay out of the

545
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,359
way

546
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,798
and let nature do the talking and the

547
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:35,558
showcasing and the speaking for people I

548
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:37,319
mean h there are things I've discovered

549
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:39,678
in microscopy that I haven't said

550
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:42,480
publicly yet and I'm letting my students

551
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,840
discover uh and and they're all like and

552
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,480
I'm like yeah I know but this is part of

553
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:48,558
the reason why I'm want the database

554
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,400
because then everyone's going to see it

555
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:55,000
and they're all going to go wait because

556
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:59,880
that's how we really cause massive

557
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,079
change big change and fast so that's you

558
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,720
know that's that's kind of like the

559
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:05,639
larger Vision around all that stuff we

560
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,360
need

561
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,799
testing really interesting stuff there

562
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:13,479
now you mentioned redo and eh and I feel

563
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:14,798
like that's something that we should get

564
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,079
deeper into I don't think a lot of

565
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,879
people really talk about it what is soil

566
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:19,798
Redux potential and how can gardeners

567
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,960
manage

568
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:26,918
it so yeah if we go back to high school

569
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,038
chemistry we remember redo or maybe some

570
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,919
of us don't remember high school

571
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:32,400
chemistry and that's okay Redux is a

572
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,038
combination of two words reduction and

573
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,759
oxidation it reals reveals a fundamental

574
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:40,200
truth about life on Earth and all life

575
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:43,240
and

576
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,840
biology if you look up oxidative

577
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:50,960
stress it's the

578
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:54,199
underlying symptom that leads to disease

579
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,120
Cancer all all illnesses are linked to

580
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,798
inflammation and inflammation is

581
00:23:56,119 --> 00:24:02,278
oxidative stress they're one thing so

582
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:05,599
you're like whoa why what is oxidative

583
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:07,640
stress what is oxidation how why is it

584
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:10,359
inflammation when we take a piece of

585
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:14,480
wood and we light fire to it and it

586
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:16,119
combusts it is flame right because it's

587
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,759
oxidizing the

588
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:25,000
wood so oxidation is the liberation of

589
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:26,558
energy so oxidized food would be dried

590
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,599
out

591
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:33,519
food so so and and then an oxidized soil

592
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:37,000
is dried out soil all the energy has

593
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:40,519
been lost and and and and and water is

594
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,119
also uh in many ways functions as energy

595
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:45,960
or a storage of energy uh for so many

596
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:48,359
things in life if you think about

597
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,759
photosynthesis as one input um light

598
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:53,199
into photosynthesis as one input water

599
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:57,119
is the other and they're doing

600
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:00,600
hydrolysis and they're releasing protons

601
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:03,519
energy so so we have to recognize that

602
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:05,798
oxidation is the loss of energy and that

603
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:08,398
means reduction despite it sounding like

604
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:10,759
we're reducing something Matt reduction

605
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:12,319
is the gain in energy I know the

606
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,879
chemistry folks you know they like to

607
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:16,599
confuse us and have their own little

608
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,039
Ivory Tower of comprehension and

609
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:20,879
confusion uh many many different

610
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:23,038
branches of science do this right

611
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,720
language is a way that back you know

612
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:26,798
hundreds and thousands of years ago you

613
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,600
would keep people out of your special

614
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,398
circles

615
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:33,918
so what they've done is made it so that

616
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:35,959
people don't realize that their bodies

617
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,559
are energy

618
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,960
based it's the drop in energy in our

619
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:42,119
bodies that leads to cancer and all

620
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:46,519
these different things this is why Dr

621
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:48,158
Zack Bush when he tests for people and

622
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:49,960
their health he's testing the charge on

623
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,159
the outside of their cell he's testing

624
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,440
the Redux potential of the

625
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:58,278
person and that's how he's telling how

626
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:00,159
healthy they are so energy is fun

627
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:02,679
fundamental to everything and in fact if

628
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,559
you go back 50 years ago I sing The Body

629
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:06,798
Electric um everything was energy based

630
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:08,798
and there's all this stuff and then

631
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:12,079
suddenly all these people came into that

632
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:14,720
area of new discovery and became very

633
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:17,599
woow woo around it and then created this

634
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,399
Kickback reaction and uh and then it

635
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:22,759
became something that no energy ooh no

636
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:25,678
one talks about that that's that's

637
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:28,879
pseudoscience meanwhile all the chemists

638
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:31,038
know energy is how everything is done

639
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,960
in fact the charges on the outside of

640
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:37,278
every you know nutrient and element is

641
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:39,278
actually the the combination lock piece

642
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,880
that fits into each reaction inside the

643
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:44,398
plant is the charge difference that

644
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:48,039
creates the POS the ability for it to

645
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:51,398
finish that that reaction so everything

646
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:53,919
is energy based so Redux is the gain and

647
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:57,798
loss of energy and the potential to to

648
00:26:53,919 --> 00:27:00,799
to to to it is the holding of the energy

649
00:26:57,798 --> 00:27:04,200
and also the potential to exchange

650
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:06,960
energy so so if it's oxidized well

651
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,640
there's not much energy and so you can't

652
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,319
exchange much energy you know what I

653
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,600
mean it's already been

654
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:15,439
lost you know it's it's it's already

655
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:18,398
been burned right there it's you know

656
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,919
it's Ash now it's lost all that BTU

657
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:24,000
right all that potential burning energy

658
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,440
and so that's really what we're talking

659
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,278
about is the actual energetic

660
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:31,759
possibility and potential of your soil

661
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,000
and what's what I've already said is

662
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,640
it's linked to

663
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,440
moisture so your soils are all dried out

664
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,919
and

665
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,159
oxidized they're going to La they're

666
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:44,278
going to to be lacking

667
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:48,000
energy now this doesn't mean that it's

668
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:51,319
um all alkaline if you're in

669
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,440
Montana Idaho and Eastern

670
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:55,158
Washington you're going to have a lot of

671
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,798
aluminum and you're going to have things

672
00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:00,278
in the soil that are going to Mineral

673
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:02,960
wise be

674
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:05,480
acidic but it's all dried out high high

675
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,640
desert and all that makes it

676
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,519
oxidized so so that's a more difficult

677
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,159
environment no doubt because as you draw

678
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:16,599
down the pH you start loosening things

679
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:20,559
and releasing things there needs to be a

680
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:23,918
lot more um solar organic matter a lot

681
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:26,798
more buffering and then you need to be

682
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,559
testing your pH regularly so that you

683
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:32,200
don't dip too much

684
00:28:29,558 --> 00:28:34,639
um and and and you stay in that

685
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,880
goldilock zone in that situation the hot

686
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,840
compost that's ph8 is exactly what you

687
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:44,720
need right to keep it in the goldilock

688
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:47,439
zone right and so it's very very

689
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,240
personal very specific to our climate

690
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:54,399
when we're talking about eh and pH and

691
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:57,000
for a long time I taught

692
00:28:54,398 --> 00:29:00,278
because my original Mentor you know

693
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,720
Elaine Ingam taught that there's this

694
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:05,240
there's this line of secession between

695
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,480
the desert and old growth forest but

696
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:13,240
that's actually a diagonal through an XY

697
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:16,440
P eh chart so I've been teaching just a

698
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:19,919
bandwidth of Truth and it's

699
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:23,519
true but all those montanans and

700
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:25,080
idahoans and Washington folk were

701
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,480
like

702
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:32,319
oh what the heck is wrong with my oil

703
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:35,200
then cuz it made no sense to them and so

704
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:38,960
so it's really important to understand

705
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,159
your situation from both pH and eh cuz

706
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,480
when you put them together you go oh I

707
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:45,320
see where I am actually that's why

708
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,240
that's that way and then when you're

709
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:50,599
doing testing for minerals and you're

710
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,880
super high in aluminum or super high in

711
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:56,439
something else you know that's causing

712
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:59,360
antagonism that's causing alkaline

713
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,038
alkaline uh state

714
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:03,719
I mean cuz we got Limestone Bedrock here

715
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:06,000
so it's like when it rains it's like and

716
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,839
you flood the field you have an

717
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
alkalinizing effect actually because it

718
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:13,319
all that acidity then combines with the

719
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,079
with the Limestone below and the

720
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:18,918
Limestone goes well there's a lot more

721
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:22,079
of me than you and then and then it re

722
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:24,240
Rel lowers your pH so so we have to

723
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,599
recognize these effects are real these

724
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,359
effects are trackable but these effects

725
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:30,240
are also you can deal with with them

726
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:32,000
because like you said at the beginning

727
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,720
you need to be worrying about the pH

728
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,798
around your roots what if you added

729
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,919
things in the root Zone and this is what

730
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:41,798
a lot of people are doing that are

731
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:44,759
acidifying in the root Zone that give

732
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,960
the plant the energy it needs to to

733
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,480
change it

734
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,919
itself um and so there's a lot of

735
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,679
options on how to do that but the reason

736
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:56,000
we pay attention to redo the wetness and

737
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,759
dryness of a site is we can easily go

738
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
too far in both directions

739
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:03,398
and depending on where we are it's going

740
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,798
to release completely different things

741
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:08,319
and so understanding where you are tells

742
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:10,918
you what dangers you have and and where

743
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,918
to push and and and then what techniques

744
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,840
will work best for you you explain that

745
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:18,080
better then I think anybody has ever

746
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:20,359
explained it to me before so I

747
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:22,480
appreciate that one now you you

748
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:25,158
mentioned a little bit about micro risal

749
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,880
fungi and I'd be willing to bet that the

750
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:28,720
folks listening in there's there's got

751
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,480
to be over 50% of the people are

752
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,558
supplementing they're adding in some

753
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,000
micro isal fungi into the medium I feel

754
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:36,759
like a lot of the grow hom Growers here

755
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,319
that are tuning in majority are hom

756
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:41,038
Growers indoors versus Outdoors now that

757
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:43,439
being said you hear a lot of people

758
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,759
talking about the application of micro

759
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,399
isal fungi if they're using a product

760
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:49,919
it's often said that sprinkling it

761
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:52,158
directly onto the root Zone during

762
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,880
transplant is the best way to go about

763
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,320
it now I've heard people saying that

764
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:00,600
it's significantly less effective to mix

765
00:31:57,319 --> 00:32:02,558
those microbes into water micral fungi

766
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:04,759
into water and then do a soil drench

767
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:06,440
with it of course is it is it less

768
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:07,919
efficient doing it that way versus

769
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,798
sprinkling directly on the roots or or

770
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,880
what's your take on that so I have more

771
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:17,759
information that is going to provide a

772
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:21,519
new way so the way the microbes work

773
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:25,119
with seeds is they they they partner

774
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:27,558
immediately with the root coming out and

775
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:29,439
then they stay in tandem with the root

776
00:32:27,558 --> 00:32:31,678
grow

777
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,558
so let's just like think about surface

778
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,399
area and

779
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:37,798
application if I take the seed and some

780
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:39,599
of you are going to be doing tiny seeds

781
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:41,480
right not like big pea seeds or bean

782
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,240
seeds so you're doing a Tiny Seed think

783
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,558
about the surface area and requirement

784
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,720
of microad fun and realize that if it's

785
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:50,678
there when it begins it's going to be

786
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,679
there the whole time

787
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:59,159
okay so giving them the initial microbes

788
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:02,120
then is the smart hardest move because

789
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:05,000
you use the least amount product now

790
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:07,879
imagine you have these already grown

791
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
roots and you're putting trying to dust

792
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,960
these things on them and you got a speck

793
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,759
here a speck here a speck here a speck

794
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,519
here well those could they'll go in and

795
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:21,919
do their thing if it's um not spores and

796
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,399
if it's uh propagules which is sections

797
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,519
of root that are inoculated from last

798
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:29,119
year that's effective not spores spores

799
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,038
would germinate when they want to and

800
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:34,439
spores are in case we get ice ages so

801
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:36,879
think about that it's in case everything

802
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,360
goes wrong so you're going to put

803
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,039
propagules so MCO

804
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,918
apply um

805
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:46,679
momax uh

806
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,600
MOS by extreme garding those are three

807
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:50,000
that I know that do that and then it's

808
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:52,199
going to start from there there and

809
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,398
there and there it's fungi so starts at

810
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,240
the point of contact and then spreads

811
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:58,959
out from there

812
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,319
so if you have powdered like the

813
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,159
wettable powder WP MOS from extreme

814
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:06,398
Garden or if you just take mortar and

815
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,358
pestle to like your your your uh

816
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:11,719
pelletize stuff and then add it

817
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:13,440
on then your seeds are going to

818
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:15,039
germinate and it's all going to just

819
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,440
immediately bond with it and then it's

820
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:19,000
going to keep Pace with it as it grows

821
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,679
and it's going to become this big old

822
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,838
plant meanwhile how much did you

823
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:29,559
actually spend per plant very very very

824
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:31,239
little cuz it just coated the seeds

825
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:33,398
and this goes with all your microbes

826
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:37,439
think about inoculating with the

827
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:40,039
endophytes that can reproduce inside the

828
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,320
plant because they're feeding off photos

829
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:45,878
synthetic um sugars and nitrogen that

830
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,800
comes in and and so so they're actually

831
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:50,519
completing photosynthesis and nitrogen

832
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:53,280
synthesis so they're replicating so

833
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:55,280
again we add these in

834
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,320
initially and if you're doing lactic

835
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,320
acid bacteria that's an Endy that also

836
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,440
stim micro risal

837
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,680
bacteria so you're partnering with all

838
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,639
these different things and they're there

839
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:08,000
the whole

840
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:10,039
time so it's about it's about timing and

841
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,599
it's about like being able to visually

842
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:14,440
verify this like I can just and most

843
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:16,960
people don't have this yet my a lot of

844
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,280
my students do but I can just turn on

845
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,720
that light that little blue light and

846
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,519
then I can see that it's that's bound to

847
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:28,159
the seeds so I could take five five of

848
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:30,639
my seeds inoculate them with the powder

849
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,838
put them in a a like do a germination

850
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:35,920
test put them in a folded over napkin or

851
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:37,599
paper towel that's damp inside a p uh

852
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,760
plastic Ziploc bag that's not fully

853
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,039
closed on a warm surface and let it

854
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,560
germinate and look at them under the

855
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:47,440
microscope and I can see that they fully

856
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:50,480
take so I can verify this for myself

857
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,480
that yeah Matt is telling the truth BEC

858
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,079
and that's what this is the kind of

859
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,079
science I like because then everyone

860
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:59,720
else can verify it for themselves and go

861
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:03,280
yeah yeah I've done it that's how it

862
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:05,799
works and and that is the kind of ground

863
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,000
we all can stand on and then we can put

864
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,079
the images on the database and then have

865
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,679
that replication play out in in public

866
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,480
and so all the people who have paid more

867
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:17,358
money than my programs who have

868
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:21,760
cognitive dissonance and

869
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:24,598
cannot let go they'll be able to let go

870
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:28,000
cuz though I have seen people literally

871
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:31,119
look at things and go you yeah but how

872
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,280
do you know and I'm like well you can

873
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,280
see it and they're

874
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,839
like right but you could have made that

875
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,079
picture and I'm like oh

876
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:43,400
dear because the reality is it's like we

877
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:45,079
can all just go look you know and but

878
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,960
there's a lot of people I mean we live

879
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:48,640
in a day and age where there are people

880
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,318
that have see things right in front of

881
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:54,118
their face and can't see it and I think

882
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:56,279
part of that's the food I think part of

883
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,160
it's cognitive distance you know they've

884
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,359
invested in a way of thinking they've

885
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:03,519
invested in a methodology or a program

886
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:06,440
that they paid more money you know um

887
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:10,838
but we also see it playing out all over

888
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:12,679
in science and everything so we have to

889
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:14,519
create things that are self-evident and

890
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:16,919
also so that people can move forward

891
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:19,079
with confidence improvising and

892
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:22,519
innovating in such a way that uh the

893
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:24,480
science moves forward in a viral way um

894
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:26,318
so so I mean if you think about

895
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,119
automobile that's how it worked there

896
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:30,800
were a thousand different automobiles

897
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,838
before the the Model T emerged and it

898
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,880
was in that innovation in that back and

899
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:39,199
forth that really citizen science you

900
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,160
know that created that and right now

901
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:43,559
we're the product all of us are the

902
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:49,318
products of uh indoor

903
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:51,599
Growers for 30 40 years doing the R&amp;D

904
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:53,279
that we're all benefiting from and again

905
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,400
it was citizen science again it was

906
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,040
people doing the work and and then

907
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,200
sharing it you know these these forums

908
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:02,960
with secret names and everything you

909
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:05,719
know for years getting that feedback

910
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,880
loop and that's that's all I'm doing you

911
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:08,799
know that's all I'm modeling it

912
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,880
afterwards is allowing that natural

913
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,000
feedback loop that natural replication

914
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:18,119
science and that V virality to quote

915
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,280
Brendan my brenon Bard um to actually F

916
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:22,519
uh change uh so so that's you know

917
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,519
that's that that's that's what's

918
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:26,800
happening and that's what I'm building

919
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:29,599
incredible yeah so if you're you're

920
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,039
basically saying coating the seed before

921
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,160
germination is actually effective so if

922
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:34,239
they're doing the paper towel method

923
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:36,399
they could just put the seed on the

924
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:38,559
paper towel sprinkle a little bit of

925
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,760
micro isal fungi on there it'll then

926
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:41,719
germinate and they can plant that

927
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,200
directly in there now what if they

928
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:46,358
instead germinate I would I wouldn't do

929
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:48,799
that for like my planting like I would

930
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:51,119
do that to verify that my micro isal

931
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,880
funga that I bought is good and that

932
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:57,280
also proves to ourselves that it it

933
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,440
stays in tandem as it grows and we're

934
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,319
like once it's inoculated it's

935
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,000
inoculated right um but that's how all

936
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:05,480
the plants evolve to do it and so being

937
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,159
able to see that and verify that a tells

938
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:11,440
you this is something that's strong it's

939
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,920
a good inoculant it works and then B I'm

940
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,880
going to be able to inoculate all my

941
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,119
seeds this way and that's what I care

942
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,599
about so if you germinate a seed and

943
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:23,280
then just dip that Tap Root in microle

944
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:25,680
fungi and then plant it that's perfectly

945
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,160
acceptable and then would you Rec it's

946
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:30,440
not recommended to do any micro isal

947
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,920
fungi applications after that because it

948
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,440
kind of grows with the plant what I

949
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,559
would do is I would actually not cuz I

950
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,960
mean they're so sensitive those those

951
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:44,799
emerging Roots I don't mess with them so

952
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:47,800
what I would do is I would do a soak of

953
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:51,839
the seed with micro isal fungi and

954
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:54,359
endites like effective microbes em or

955
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:57,759
the equivalent which is yeast purple on

956
00:39:54,358 --> 00:40:00,318
Silver bacteria and lacad bacteria would

957
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,079
do those three and then you would soak

958
00:40:00,318 --> 00:40:05,719
it and so it would be soaked up into the

959
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:07,680
seed the seed would have nutrients and

960
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:09,879
have microbes and all this stuff

961
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:12,239
happening all at the same time cuz I

962
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,680
mean with em there's some leftover you

963
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:16,959
know car carbon from the molasses and

964
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:19,598
stuff so it soaks that up it has that

965
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,960
extra energy and potential and then you

966
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:26,200
plant that so after like you know like

967
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,880
an hour to six hour this a smaller seed

968
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:31,358
mat so I would do an hour to two hours

969
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,039
uh of soaking maybe Max two hours I

970
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:36,199
would observe uh different I different

971
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:38,000
seeds are going to behave different ways

972
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:39,480
the larger the seed the longer the soak

973
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,559
the smaller the seed the shorter the

974
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:45,400
soak and so I would soak it in that and

975
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:47,078
then I would so what I do is I pour off

976
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,400
the excess and then a lot of this

977
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:51,000
inoculant heavier especially if you let

978
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,920
it settle for an hour so it's at the

979
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,318
bottom like a slurry and then I would

980
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:58,838
mix it with the seeds and it would like

981
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:01,079
subtly scarf ify the seeds a little bit

982
00:40:58,838 --> 00:41:03,519
you know CU a little bit grit to that

983
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:06,318
and get that all deeper and embedded and

984
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:10,119
coated and then I would plant

985
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:13,279
those so it's and and you're like oh

986
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:16,318
Matt well you know I'm doing a large

987
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,200
farm and can I just add it as a powdered

988
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:21,358
Amendment like my rise oia you can

989
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:23,439
totally do that that's totally okay uh

990
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:25,920
though you want it to stick as much as

991
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,599
possible so maybe adding a little bit of

992
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,480
water or a little bit of binder or

993
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:33,559
something um maybe something that's damp

994
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,920
maybe something like um like compost or

995
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:39,799
something as a carrier that'll keep it

996
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:42,760
in contact with the seeds uh so that it

997
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,440
goes in together and is right there but

998
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,119
most of us if we're doing small scale

999
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,639
we're doing plantings that are indoors

1000
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:50,920
we're going to be babying our seeds we

1001
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:52,519
paid a lot for these seeds and so you

1002
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,559
you can do that slurry and then you can

1003
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:56,480
plant them

1004
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:59,318
individually and again doing the testing

1005
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,920
on your micro risal F before you you use

1006
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:05,400
it on everything proves to yourself a

1007
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,800
that you made the right purchase and

1008
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,559
then B that this is going to be a good

1009
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,519
inoculation let's go for this understood

1010
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:14,039
yeah thanks for breaking down the

1011
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,039
details on that one good uh good

1012
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:17,599
actionable advice for sure I want to

1013
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:19,800
flip it up and talk about something

1014
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,920
which I believe I heard on either your

1015
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,880
Instagram or your YouTube channel and it

1016
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,800
was in regards to mushroom blocks like

1017
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,480
oyster you had mentioned that it

1018
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,599
actually kills off beneficial nematodes

1019
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,400
can you talk to us about that yeah it's

1020
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:39,280
pissed off so many people so so the

1021
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:42,599
reality is there are papers where

1022
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:45,280
they're deworming cattle and sheep with

1023
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:47,440
oyster mushroom mycelium and oyster

1024
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,280
mushroom blocks with which are mycelium

1025
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,760
right and

1026
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:56,800
so my idea was like oh this is a natural

1027
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:58,640
dewormer this is awesome because the

1028
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,000
effect of this are

1029
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:03,400
temporary what happened was people that

1030
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,119
didn't understand the science around it

1031
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,880
got really mad and I actually had a a

1032
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:10,318
person that used to be a friend freak

1033
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,838
out and kind of lose their minds cuz

1034
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:14,639
they thought I was assaulting their

1035
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:18,039
business cuz they they do mushroom block

1036
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:19,558
gardens and it was super upsetting

1037
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:22,719
because it's like they don't they didn't

1038
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:25,839
even hear me uh and then it became this

1039
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:27,679
weird thing it it was just really wild

1040
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:29,759
uh and so I don't know if it was this

1041
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,480
was like a a thing that they attacked

1042
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:36,079
because of other things in their life

1043
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:38,880
but it was weird they they basically got

1044
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,559
so upset because they felt like I was um

1045
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,358
saying that the oyster mushrooms are

1046
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:46,640
going to destroy soil the reality is

1047
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:49,598
oyster mushrooms you know when you add

1048
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:52,838
them to the soil will kill all the

1049
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,960
nematodes that it comes in contact with

1050
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:56,480
but this is the same with RI this is the

1051
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,400
same with turkey tail like a bunch of

1052
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,039
mushrooms so I'm not talking out of

1053
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,200
school this is already published and

1054
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:05,519
well known and so I just was sharing the

1055
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:08,399
information I didn't like invent it I

1056
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:10,559
didn't you know what I mean and so it

1057
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,440
was shocking in that regard but then it

1058
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:16,040
was like they're not even reading cuz I

1059
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,720
literally posted like after I said that

1060
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:22,239
in the next post another article showing

1061
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:24,919
that within days and up to like a week

1062
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:27,959
you have that die off being replaced by

1063
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:31,680
a flush of beneficial nematodes

1064
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:34,838
so it's sessional so just like when we

1065
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:38,000
like clear the Slate the Right Way

1066
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:40,440
beneficials come back and not you know

1067
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,079
like using chemical ster sterilizers

1068
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,960
causes bad things to come back when you

1069
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:50,760
do a biological reset you have good

1070
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:54,079
biology come back so it I I I I was

1071
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:56,119
really bothered by by their attack um

1072
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:59,800
because I you know I've been trying for

1073
00:44:56,119 --> 00:45:03,358
years to help this person person uh and

1074
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:06,440
and so it just was something that I put

1075
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:09,039
out there because it's true um it's

1076
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,920
functional you can be deworming your

1077
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,719
animals and you could be using a

1078
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,760
microscope and a hemocytometer and

1079
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:17,239
checking their stool to make sure that

1080
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,200
you dewormed them you know what I mean

1081
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:22,159
and then you can verify with the same

1082
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:24,199
microscope that those soils go through

1083
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:28,679
that dip and come out the other

1084
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:30,519
end so so I was sh ing something that I

1085
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:33,679
knew that people if they just took the

1086
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:37,440
time could verify could

1087
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:40,000
follow and and then could do confidently

1088
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:42,519
and what you know my good friends um

1089
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,039
like uh Angel shatz who literally has

1090
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:47,280
given out thousands of these blocks

1091
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:49,239
heard me say the first part of it and

1092
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:53,720
she literally was like that's awesome

1093
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:56,639
Matt I never knew that and had no qualms

1094
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:58,838
nothing was upsetting to her she's the

1095
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:00,838
best so Central Texas mology has been

1096
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:03,440
giving out these blocks but she knows

1097
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:05,318
the gardens are beautiful and so she

1098
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:09,720
knew because of her experience that it

1099
00:46:05,318 --> 00:46:11,199
was okay you know and and and so then

1100
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:12,959
when I followed up with that second

1101
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,558
article she was like ha that's what

1102
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,639
we're seeing on our end you know because

1103
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:19,160
she's in she's in my college she's

1104
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:21,960
looking at all these things with open

1105
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:25,598
eyes and allowing nature to speak to her

1106
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:27,519
and so um it is the case that they do

1107
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,000
that it is the case that we can replace

1108
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:32,800
all this dewormer that people are using

1109
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,318
which hilariously enough is often

1110
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:39,599
Ivermectin

1111
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:42,358
but so so so we can use oyster mushrooms

1112
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:46,280
and replace all that uh and get our

1113
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:48,920
animals manure to a place where we can

1114
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:50,400
use in compost again you know some

1115
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,559
people are using dewormed compost and

1116
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,200
it's ruining their compost and they're

1117
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:58,680
all freaked out so we can do incredible

1118
00:46:55,199 --> 00:47:02,838
things with natural modalities but so

1119
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:07,639
much of it is U not letting hysteria

1120
00:47:02,838 --> 00:47:09,960
fear or just like unbridled uh optimism

1121
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:12,318
you know so that people generalize like

1122
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,880
the winds it's like we got a

1123
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:17,639
contextualize the winds so that we see

1124
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:22,119
the caveats the ranges of expression and

1125
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:24,000
also just the limitations right so so I

1126
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:27,599
definitely brought that up and I

1127
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
definitely uh saw Wild reaction ction to

1128
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,119
that uh

1129
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,239
and you

1130
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,519
know it was it was sobering because I

1131
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:38,598
mean yeah they said crazy things they

1132
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:41,079
were saying that I was stealing the the

1133
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:43,960
microbes with the the microscope by

1134
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:46,599
seeing them and naming them and I was

1135
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,358
like well no actually someone already

1136
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:52,160
has named all

1137
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:55,199
these we're just seeing who they are and

1138
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:57,558
yeah so it's uh it's it's quite a world

1139
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:59,159
we live in uh right now there's a lot of

1140
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:03,559
people who are freaking out there's a

1141
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:06,799
lot of people that um need need to go

1142
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:10,359
out in nature and

1143
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,400
meditate I hear you yeah that's that's

1144
00:48:10,358 --> 00:48:15,039
one thing with content creation where

1145
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,280
it's you do your best to try to share

1146
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:18,318
good information that's going to be

1147
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,440
valuable people and there's always that

1148
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:22,679
somebody who takes spins it and turns

1149
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,720
into something negative and then you get

1150
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:27,358
attacked for it it's just that's part of

1151
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:29,639
the job I guess right

1152
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:32,639
yeah definitely I I was a high school

1153
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:34,799
English teacher and I've seen it all um

1154
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:36,920
and most of the time the attacks really

1155
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,480
just our Reflections on the other person

1156
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,639
and the hardship that they're going

1157
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,199
through uh and uh like this person I'm

1158
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:46,440
talking about I wish them nothing but

1159
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:48,919
good things uh I really hope that uh the

1160
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,798
animosity

1161
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:53,519
drains all right so uh switching it up a

1162
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:56,039
little bit here I want to get your

1163
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:57,759
thoughts on the 24-hour light cycle now

1164
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:59,239
we have so many folks out there that

1165
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,640
they want to get you know grow plants

1166
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:03,479
faster get a better result so they're

1167
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:06,400
putting their indoor plants on 24 hours

1168
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:08,440
of light and zero hours of Darkness now

1169
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,400
the night time when you know lights are

1170
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,480
off that's when sugar Transportation

1171
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,559
happens so my question for you is does

1172
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,559
it happen less with that 24-hour light

1173
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,920
cycle therefore negatively impacting

1174
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:22,798
plant growth at all yeah so so we have

1175
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,400
to remember that um there's a wide range

1176
00:49:22,798 --> 00:49:28,480
of plants and plant expression right and

1177
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,798
so um there are some plants that are

1178
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,719
going to grow really well in the land of

1179
00:49:30,798 --> 00:49:35,838
the Midnight Sun right um and they're

1180
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:38,679
going to have mechanisms that allow them

1181
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:43,719
to just keep going and

1182
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:46,919
growing uh but we're also we also have

1183
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:48,239
respiration plants respire and they only

1184
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,318
do that when they're

1185
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:53,000
resting and

1186
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:54,400
so my instinct is that you'll get

1187
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,960
different

1188
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:00,880
things like we're going to get different

1189
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:04,280
relationships of microbes and

1190
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:06,680
different different like uh tpin and

1191
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:09,480
different medicinal qualities from both

1192
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:12,199
these methods I want to see side by

1193
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:15,679
sides and full workups on like the parts

1194
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:20,118
per million on the Felix the tpin all

1195
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:21,679
those things uh to really to really say

1196
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:23,920
and you're going to probably have

1197
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:26,399
differences in expression in in terms of

1198
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,240
like where the plants from so let's say

1199
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,720
you're growing a a you know a certain

1200
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:32,039
plant from like the Himalayas right

1201
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:35,000
those are going to behave very

1202
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:38,599
differently from like the same family

1203
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:42,679
from Africa right uh and those genes do

1204
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:44,599
exist in strains right and so what I've

1205
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:47,159
seen in practice with people doing

1206
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:50,240
indoor grows from them flushing things

1207
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:54,000
to like the artificial light cycles um

1208
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:55,199
they're all trying to imitate or short

1209
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,798
uh cut

1210
00:50:55,199 --> 00:51:00,838
nature why do we do light depth we do

1211
00:50:58,798 --> 00:51:03,159
light depth because we're trying to

1212
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:04,798
imitate the end of the season when

1213
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:08,879
there's less

1214
00:51:04,798 --> 00:51:11,440
light and so if we take that as the as

1215
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:15,079
the guiding principle you got to do

1216
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:17,798
what's most natural and like that's the

1217
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:19,079
principles behind this I literally ask

1218
00:51:17,798 --> 00:51:22,639
what's most natural how did nature

1219
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:26,640
originally do this um and and and

1220
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:28,639
whenever we see amazing plants um and

1221
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:32,879
we're obviously talking about a specific

1222
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:37,519
amazing plant um there's abilities of

1223
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:42,039
these plants that kind of blow our

1224
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:45,079
minds but what's best for the plant and

1225
00:51:42,039 --> 00:51:47,239
what creates the best product is really

1226
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:49,200
the question the plant can do crazy

1227
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:51,879
things like for instance Canadian

1228
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:54,519
Growers when I talk to you know Joy

1229
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,760
Beckerman you know Joy no uh she's the

1230
00:51:54,519 --> 00:52:00,759
reason that the fiber cousin of the

1231
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:02,520
plant we're talking about is legal she

1232
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,799
was the lawyer who fought the federal

1233
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:07,519
government sponsored by you know John

1234
00:52:04,798 --> 00:52:08,639
rach's nativa so that they could do that

1235
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:11,318
those

1236
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:13,199
Foods um she had me talking to Canadian

1237
00:52:11,318 --> 00:52:15,480
Growers and they're they they figured

1238
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:17,879
out that there's no ceiling on

1239
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,599
nitrogen so they're raising the

1240
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,039
synthetic nitrogen Higher and Higher and

1241
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,200
the plants are getting bigger and bigger

1242
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:24,480
and because they don't care about the

1243
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:25,960
seeds they only care about the fiber

1244
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,519
they're like well no one's going to eat

1245
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:30,920
it let's go oh and so it doesn't matter

1246
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:33,000
if it's high in nitrate it didn't matter

1247
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,838
that it's like anible it didn't matter

1248
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,119
that it never left vegetative state and

1249
00:52:34,838 --> 00:52:38,639
went didn't go to reproductive and

1250
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:41,480
didn't form seeds so they're just like

1251
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:44,960
throwing it on there and the soil is a

1252
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:46,880
desert they're destroying the soil so

1253
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,720
the whole narrative around like well the

1254
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:52,160
soil will be saved by this

1255
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:54,598
plant no no no no no not the way they're

1256
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:57,279
doing it not industrial industrial

1257
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:58,240
growers in Canada and they're modeling

1258
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,200
for

1259
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:04,879
Americans and so so we have to recognize

1260
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:06,519
that there are aspects where you can

1261
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,960
abuse the

1262
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:11,400
system but is that good because it's

1263
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,559
like yeah you get two years where it's

1264
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,280
like

1265
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:17,040
phenomenal and then your soil is dead

1266
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:20,119
and then they have to rotate

1267
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:23,119
it and then they go to this thing which

1268
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:25,200
is so depressing and this is most of the

1269
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:26,838
Pacific Northwest this is most of Canada

1270
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:29,039
they're like well we'll come back in 3

1271
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:30,599
years and farm it like abusively again

1272
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,639
and then we won't be able to do it for

1273
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:35,359
another 3 years but then we'll do it

1274
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:37,598
again and so they leave it follow and

1275
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:40,358
they let it Let It Go and they show back

1276
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:43,519
up and then they abuse it again and then

1277
00:53:40,358 --> 00:53:45,480
they like leave it for 3 years meanwhile

1278
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:47,838
they could be farming that patch of land

1279
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:49,760
every year and having the soil improve

1280
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:50,639
their products improve and their bottom

1281
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,160
line

1282
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:56,199
improve so so that's really like a lot

1283
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:57,879
of what I'm doing is getting people to

1284
00:53:56,199 --> 00:54:01,039
re recognize the

1285
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:03,039
Holistics involved and to be able to see

1286
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:04,199
and and understand the longevity of

1287
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:06,759
their

1288
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:08,279
operation because yeah there there

1289
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,640
there's there's plenty of things that we

1290
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:15,480
could do that could stretch it this way

1291
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:18,598
or that way or or push things you know

1292
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:21,199
but asking what's most

1293
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:23,760
natural has a holistic

1294
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:27,639
effect you know if we're not burning our

1295
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:30,200
soil you could amend and use that soil

1296
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:32,480
again or you could treat and then

1297
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:33,639
ferment and use that soil again like a

1298
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,880
bunch of things you could

1299
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:41,118
do um you could even dump them all in

1300
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:43,318
the backyard amend it tarp it ferment it

1301
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,680
and then use it all again you know

1302
00:54:43,318 --> 00:54:48,199
there's a bunch of things that people

1303
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:49,960
can do uh that they're not doing so so

1304
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:52,798
that's that's really my instinct when I

1305
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:55,159
hear like that like can we go all the

1306
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:58,199
way it's like you know plants are pretty

1307
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:59,920
amazing they're want to survive and like

1308
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:02,000
we can do like these hoops and make them

1309
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,000
do these weird things like I mean they

1310
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,358
have plants now like imitating plastic

1311
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
leaves you and they're like the plet can

1312
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:10,598
see and it's like yeah the plantet can

1313
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,199
see cuz it's trying to survive you know

1314
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:15,079
what I mean he like you know we're

1315
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:16,879
torturing things to see how far they can

1316
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:18,960
go we're like we're doing all this stuff

1317
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,400
instead of saying like what would be

1318
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,318
best for the plant and letting that

1319
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:26,760
speak to us and looking

1320
00:55:23,318 --> 00:55:29,279
at what that actually looks like because

1321
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,480
when a plant's super healthy it's going

1322
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,400
to actually invest in the Next

1323
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:35,119
Generation so when a plant's super

1324
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:39,358
healthy partnering with micro razal

1325
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:42,680
fungi it actually leaves the hyul uh the

1326
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:47,159
hyle expression of the fungi around the

1327
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:50,199
cell so you'll have like this lipid Rich

1328
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:52,719
H that's just sitting there and that's

1329
00:55:50,199 --> 00:55:56,719
what becomes the inoculant when that

1330
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:58,480
root dies for next year so and a new

1331
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:01,279
root touches it and inoculates the new

1332
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:03,798
root what happens in hard times is the

1333
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:07,160
plant actually reabsorbs that and it

1334
00:56:03,798 --> 00:56:08,719
eats the lipids as energy because lipids

1335
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:10,358
are like the best form of energy the

1336
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:14,719
longest lasting form of energy we know

1337
00:56:10,358 --> 00:56:17,400
it's fats right so it's an investment in

1338
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:20,318
the micro risal fungi that they can

1339
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,680
liquidate in times of stress or they can

1340
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:22,880
pass on to their children next year

1341
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:25,279
because who's going to be growing in the

1342
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,119
soil of their root Zone most likely

1343
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:31,680
their seeds their

1344
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:33,119
children so plants when they have enough

1345
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:35,960
are going to do things that are going to

1346
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:38,318
enrich the soil going to have secession

1347
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:40,000
and and and and regenerative quality so

1348
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:42,318
that it goes happens the next year the

1349
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,318
microbes are preserved for next year and

1350
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:46,960
passed

1351
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:49,558
on they're going to do things that we

1352
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,880
can't do or we don't want to spend the

1353
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:54,039
money you know in the time doing and

1354
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:56,000
they're just going to do it for us so so

1355
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:57,720
so that when I hear that and I think

1356
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,440
about that that's really what I see as

1357
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:02,719
like what we should shift to got it yeah

1358
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,200
reusing the soil for example that's

1359
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:07,159
something I've been reusing the same

1360
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:08,598
soil now for seven gross and uh you know

1361
00:57:07,159 --> 00:57:10,558
ever since I started really getting into

1362
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:13,000
Organics and realized that it is

1363
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,559
possible to reuse over and over again I

1364
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,798
have been and I've been saving so much

1365
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:19,960
money it has been has been awesome

1366
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:23,239
keeping on that topic when you kind of

1367
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:25,039
re-enrich your soil with minerals I want

1368
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:26,679
to get into your recommendations a

1369
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:29,599
little bit what minerals you recommend

1370
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:31,038
gardeners use to replenish their soils

1371
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,960
did you recommend things like rock dust

1372
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:35,440
seaweed compost manure what's your

1373
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:38,519
general recommendations I know you

1374
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,838
should get a soil test and see what is

1375
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:42,000
missing from your soil and then kind of

1376
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:44,038
go from there but generally speaking

1377
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,798
about the types of minerals what do you

1378
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:48,359
recommend and also what should Growers

1379
00:57:45,798 --> 00:57:50,559
avoid yeah so there's a few different

1380
00:57:48,358 --> 00:57:52,078
things um someone just in Florida

1381
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:53,240
recently figured out how to remove

1382
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,680
arsenic from

1383
00:57:53,239 --> 00:57:58,598
seaweed so all the fears around like

1384
00:57:56,679 --> 00:58:00,519
arsenic buildup in our soil because

1385
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:03,119
we're using seaweed uh we're going to be

1386
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:05,519
able to figure out and avoid right I

1387
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:07,280
really like seaweed makes sense we think

1388
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:09,400
about lead Zeppelin rubber plant you

1389
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,680
know mountains flow into the sea it's

1390
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:15,119
true they do and that's where all the

1391
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:17,679
minerals have gone right and so bringing

1392
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:21,280
those back is really effective I really

1393
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:23,480
like ocean minerals I love the idea of

1394
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,119
farming the coastline to bring the

1395
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:29,079
utopic down and then return those

1396
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:30,720
nutrients to the soil in such a way that

1397
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:35,240
sticks this

1398
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:38,279
time and so I I I I really I really like

1399
00:58:35,239 --> 00:58:41,318
that cycle because it permacultural it's

1400
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:43,720
like the bior regional solution right

1401
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:45,599
we've had all this runoff all this

1402
00:58:43,719 --> 00:58:49,038
phosphate nitrogen fertilizer from all

1403
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:52,039
the Lawns it's actually right there

1404
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:54,720
killing things in the waters like you

1405
00:58:52,039 --> 00:58:59,400
know Coastal Florida right and it's like

1406
00:58:54,719 --> 00:59:03,399
if we just do vertical farming we just

1407
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:06,160
do seaweed farming uh crustation farming

1408
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:09,880
you know those things can be turned into

1409
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:11,440
fertilizers very easily and then and and

1410
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:16,160
not only that it can be done in such a

1411
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:20,720
di di DIY way crean natural farming you

1412
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:24,078
know all we can do all this uh and so I

1413
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:25,879
really like that as a modality and as a

1414
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,640
generalized system for fixing a lot of

1415
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,880
things

1416
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:31,400
I like rock dust but with the caveat

1417
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:33,039
that if you don't look at what's on your

1418
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,760
rock dust test you may be adding a lot

1419
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:38,000
of

1420
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:40,119
aluminum so right Dan kitridge years ago

1421
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,960
said whatever local rock dust you have

1422
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:46,640
is the best rock dust uh not in my

1423
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:49,960
experience I've had too many students um

1424
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:53,558
and I've seen too many examples of of of

1425
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:55,318
local areas that are just like no you

1426
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:58,400
know might want to bring something else

1427
00:59:55,318 --> 01:00:00,400
in uh and that's okay but it's knowing

1428
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,720
that moving forward with open eyes I

1429
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,798
think that is the most critical so look

1430
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:07,759
at the test readouts and different Kelps

1431
01:00:05,798 --> 01:00:09,880
different seaweeds are from different

1432
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:13,319
areas and they have totally different

1433
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:16,640
readouts so so I would look at those

1434
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:18,759
things um and

1435
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:21,239
and you know depending on what you're

1436
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:24,000
growing if it's a heavy feeder I would

1437
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:26,838
be doing you know I really like bunny

1438
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,880
manure bunny manure has been like the

1439
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:31,480
gold you know and so many operations

1440
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:35,000
that I've done I've been like where's

1441
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:37,838
the local FFA or FAA instructor who's

1442
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,679
doing rabbits uh because it's like they

1443
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:42,078
have the best manure um of course you

1444
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:43,318
got to monitor what they're eating you

1445
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:47,599
got to know what they're eating and what

1446
01:00:43,318 --> 01:00:50,639
they're giving them um but man I I I in

1447
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:53,559
terms of manure goat and body manure cuz

1448
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:55,558
it's cold it's not already hot Marco

1449
01:00:53,559 --> 01:00:58,920
microbes Marco's microbes originally

1450
01:00:55,559 --> 01:01:01,480
talked about how he loves it too uh I I

1451
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:05,400
I think that's a great great usage um

1452
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:08,240
great great Amendment but in

1453
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:11,160
general other than like those minim

1454
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:14,078
minimal mineral kind of amendments I

1455
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:16,920
really rely upon microbes cuz so much of

1456
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:18,760
the the nutrients that we want are there

1457
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:22,079
they're just not solubilized and the

1458
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:24,920
only way to solubilize them is either

1459
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:27,400
crazy extremes with ph or something or

1460
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:30,519
you just simply have microbes and the

1461
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:33,318
microbes are mining it and unlocking it

1462
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:37,079
and solubilizing it transporting it

1463
01:01:33,318 --> 01:01:39,440
transforming it and that autonomy that

1464
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:41,839
we give to the microbes and the plant

1465
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:44,960
and the soil microbes it creates this

1466
01:01:41,838 --> 01:01:48,239
economy that that ends up feeding things

1467
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:51,318
better and and at such a rate and

1468
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:54,959
complexity that we can't imitate

1469
01:01:51,318 --> 01:01:58,400
so I really like seaweed I like rock

1470
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:00,079
dust with a C yet that if we don't look

1471
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,960
we don't see and we can easily get

1472
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:05,160
bitten so do that all right some good

1473
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,519
recommendations there well Matt this

1474
01:02:05,159 --> 01:02:09,598
talk has been awesome I mean I'm sure we

1475
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:11,079
could go on for another two hours if we

1476
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:13,440
really wanted to but we're going to wrap

1477
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:14,760
things up here can you tell listeners

1478
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,519
how they can find you and what you have

1479
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:19,880
upcoming in the future yeah if you go to

1480
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:22,038
the site regenerative soil science.com

1481
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:25,318
it'll have and you just type that in

1482
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:26,920
it's a lead link so I I'm not super

1483
01:02:25,318 --> 01:02:29,119
sophisticated the internet I figured out

1484
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:30,880
like lead links um and they all lead to

1485
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:33,160
my courses and all my stuff on the

1486
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:36,400
kajabi platform so I've got like 15

1487
01:02:33,159 --> 01:02:38,879
online courses I've got you know over 24

1488
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:41,119
different books but regenerative soil

1489
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,760
science.com is the place to start with

1490
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:46,400
everything it's a place to go next month

1491

I'm going to be starting regenerative

1492
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,039
soil microscopy the new season and the

1493
01:02:48,838 --> 01:02:52,440
month after that we'll restarting

1494

1495
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,880
though so you could hop in and take it

1496
01:02:54,119 --> 01:02:58,119
self-paced and then you have lifetime

1497
01:02:55,880 --> 01:03:00,400
access to the lives so you could join us

1498
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:02,240
at any point this month I'm going to be

1499
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:05,760

1500
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:07,159
online session as well so all this stuff

1501
