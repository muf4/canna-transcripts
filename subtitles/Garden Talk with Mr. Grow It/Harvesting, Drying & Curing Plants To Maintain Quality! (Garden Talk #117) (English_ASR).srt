year at a conference uh had a good

90

conversation you actually knew you

91
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,360
before the conference very familiar with

92
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,360
your work I went through the Utah State

93
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,599
University the cultivation certificate

94
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,599
program and I know you have a couple

95
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:29,798
talks in there and uh one of them was on

96
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,919
post Harvest production the harvesting

97
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,799
drying and curing and that's really what

98
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,199
I want to get into today is you just

99
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,239
have so much experience in regards to

100
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,399
that and we've come so far in the past 5

101
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,200
years alone it's it's amazing what we've

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,840
uncovered so yeah I'm sure that you're

103
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:46,039
going to give us a bunch of insight and

104
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,840
I think uh a lot of my audience is going

105
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:49,798
to learn some things today that they

106
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,640
haven't known because I feel like a lot

107
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,200
of the stuff still isn't widespread as

108
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:54,518
much as it could be but before we get

109
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,639
deep into things can you tell us a

110
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,759
little bit about yourself and how you

111
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:00,919
got into gardening yeah so you know I

112
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:03,919
think I was I was born with it I was

113
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,958
born with green thumbs um my

114
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,598
grandparents my great grandparents their

115
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:12,438
parents everybody has been Farmers for

116
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:15,759
one thing or the other so uh yeah I I

117
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:20,238
was basically born in a greenhouse um we

118
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:23,079
grew trees uh be root ball and burlap um

119
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,959
we did patunas and pansies at one point

120
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:28,039
a little bit of everything um and so

121
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:30,198
because of that I swore I was never

122
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:34,120
going to go into plants when I was old

123
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:37,038
but here I am with a PhD in plant

124
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,120
science um I don't know it's just one of

125
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:40,240
those things when you're little you're

126
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:44,399
not going to do what your parents do but

127
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,800
you know I uh I I I loved it and I got

128
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,679
into it obviously um but I I got my PhD

129
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,840
from Clemson University and in plant

130
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,879
environmental science and um you know to

131
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,560
be honest I didn't know exactly wanted

132
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:01,600
what I wanted to do after graduation and

133
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,839
so um I did Consulting for a while with

134
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,280
Pest Management for green houses across

135
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,719
the US and started getting some calls

136
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:11,959
for medicinal plant

137
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,880
Consulting and so I took a few jobs and

138
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:16,799
loved it packed my stuff up and uh got a

139
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,319
job first but I packed my stuff up and

140
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,199
and moved to San Diego and stayed out

141
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,680
there for about 3 and 1 half years um

142
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,400
working for a vertical group uh which

143
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,360
was wonderful I got to learn everything

144
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:33,279
from SE to cell as they say it um um and

145
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,319
then decided I wanted to to do my own

146
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,758
thing and um you know have a little more

147
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:41,120
freedom to research what I wanted and do

148
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,960
what I wanted um and not be tied down by

149
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,240
um you know hitting a bottom line per se

150
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:49,680
so even though that is of course still

151
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,840
important um but you know research and

152
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,120
and commercial production is certainly a

153
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,560
a different world to live in so moved

154
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,280
back to South Carolina where um we've

155
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,000
been growing under the hemp program um

156
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,638
since since I guess

157
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,038
2018 and here we I own the hemp mine so

158
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,120
that's a a CBD company um we do

159
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:12,959
everything from breeding selling

160
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,360
genetics all the way to harvest and um

161
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,079
consumer goods and that sort of thing uh

162
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,439
but really what's near and dear to my

163
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:22,918
heart is the research aspect and um we

164
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:26,439
created the CRC the Cannabis research

165
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:28,519
Coalition with uh Dr fa at Clemson

166
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:30,279
University and so we've been running

167
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:32,918
that for about

168
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:35,478
uh about 3 years now and it's it's

169
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:37,120
really a three- tiered program I guess

170
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:41,199
you could call it one is more of a

171
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,160
membership model where you give money um

172
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,759
and what you receive back in return is

173
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,680
uh Early Access to research all the

174
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:53,598
nitty-gritty that may not be published

175
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:57,160
in a a peer- reviewed paper um

176
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,878
Sops access to talk to you know hear and

177
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,439
listen from some of the nation's top

178
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:05,479
Growers you know glass house um State

179
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:07,160
House etc etc and so just a place to get

180
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:08,959
together and talk about some of the

181
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,240
problems you're having um as far as

182
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:14,839
growing goes um we're also a contract

183
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,519
research organization and so if

184
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,679
somebody's having problems or if they

185
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,519
have a great product and they say you

186
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,079
know we've we've had as much internal

187
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:26,079
R&amp;D as possible um let's we need

188
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,120
somebody else to verify it cuz you know

189
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,839
how you know you can trust your own

190
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,680
research but if you're some trying to

191
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,279
buy a product you don't necessarily only

192
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,560
want to listen to internal research so

193
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:40,399
we're that third party non-biased um you

194
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,079
know nothing tied to to to support bias

195
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,679
which I know later you want to talk

196
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,680
about that in a little a little greater

197
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,038
detail which I'm happy to um and then of

198
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,280
course we do Consulting and Audits and

199
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:54,399
and things of that nature that's awesome

200
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,918
yeah you have so much going on and well

201
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,478
yeah clemon University Dr y Vos big name

202
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:00,598
there in regards to post Harvest

203
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,878
production as well I know he had a talk

204
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:05,759
at Utah State University you guys go

205
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,039
real real deep into it and a lot deeper

206
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,280
than I think the average homeg grower

207
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,279
goes into it being able to expose some

208
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,000
of the information here today I think is

209
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,559
going to be really valuable so let's

210
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,240
just get right into it let's get into uh

211
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,519
let's start with harvesting then we'll

212
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,879
get into drying and then curing so for

213
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:23,158
harvesting talking about the ideal time

214
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,520
to harvest a plant now it's mostly known

215
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:26,478
that when the tricomes are mostly cloudy

216
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,158
that's when they're at the highest

217
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:31,800
potency now some people like for it to

218
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:35,559
turn Amber where the inside canabo go

219
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:38,120
from THC to CBN is all of that still

220
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:40,518
true today is that still the ideal time

221
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,360
to harvest a plant you know you said

222
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,919
earlier

223
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,759
that you said earlier that in the last 5

224
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:48,879
years we've come a long way but the

225
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:52,039
deeper in I get the more I understand

226
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:54,159
how much I don't understand um so you

227
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:57,159
know I I'll give you what's known today

228
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:59,278
or at least what's theorized today um

229
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:01,639
because you know there's more than what

230
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,240
but any of us and any of our lifetimes

231
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:04,720
are going to figure out you know this is

232
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,799
certainly going to be something that's

233
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,480
done for hundreds of years um and and is

234
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,319
why this industry is so exciting for me

235
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,959
because if I were to study patunas or

236
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:17,278
poinsettas you know there's hundreds of

237
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:20,159
of of uh journals out there with great

238
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:22,320
information already so but yeah with

239
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,679
with harvesting I would say the most

240
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,079
important thing is to be delicate with

241
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:28,439
the plants um you know if you're in a

242
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:30,199
commercial setting a lot of times you're

243
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,200
rushed and hurry and you're just

244
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:38,120
throwing plants around you know every

245
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:40,240
time you touch a tricol it will bust um

246
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,440
for lack of better words so just being

247
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,240
as delicate as possible having it touch

248
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,920
as little things as possible um will

249
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,360
certainly keep your plant in a lot

250
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,319
better state but as far as when you know

251
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,639
what

252
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,399
color uh the Tricom

253
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:00,199
is you know I have found by you know by

254
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,159
being a breeder and seeing lots of

255
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,240
different varieties CBD CBG THC you know

256
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:07,600
seeing all of the varieties that are out

257
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,560
there that produce different cannaboids

258
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,360
I I've yet to find a a true consistency

259
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:18,159
of you know being able to say 10% Amber

260
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,278
perfect Harvest um it it it doesn't

261
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,000
happen the same way with every variety

262
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:26,159
so you know what what I always suggest

263
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,440
is if you have a new variety and a lot

264
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:31,679
of this is costly but this is this is

265
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,839
perfect we scenario okay you have a new

266
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:38,479
variety and the breeder says it's a 8we

267
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:40,040
plant at at we I mean the earlier you go

268
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,720
the better and you can graph it out and

269
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:46,039
see how you know your THC CBD whatever

270
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,839
it is um can progress and and where it

271
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:50,078
Peaks and where it starts to decline and

272
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,959
you can compare that to you know what it

273
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:55,078
looks like under the microscope and then

274
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:57,958
you have that to repeat from um but

275
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:59,759
testing is expensive and you know it's

276
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,719
not necessarily worth it for everyone

277
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,879
but I would just say repetition and

278
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,519
growing a

279
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:08,838
variety um and and a lot of it's

280
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,759
personal preference as well I mean I I

281
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:14,320
like mine to be on the earlier side

282
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:15,480
where they're more they're more clear um

283
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,800
and then there's some people that they

284
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,159
want it to be extremely Amber so a lot

285
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:25,679
of that's preference and um this is this

286
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:28,480
is simply Theory but I do not think the

287
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:31,000
Amber comes from the THC to CBN

288
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,920
conversion I think it could be uh some

289
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,759
sort of non-enzymatic Browning um like

290
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,120
other plants do when they ripen so

291
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:42,159
bananas and uh apples when you cut them

292
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,839
there's some uh en enzimatic Browning

293
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,799
happening um and so that's hope

294
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:49,560
hopefully something I'll get to dig into

295
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,479
this year um finding people to work with

296
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:54,199
that can test some of these more

297
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,480
nitty-gritty aspects of the plant has

298
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:00,040
has been pretty tough um and we finally

299
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:04,480
got um a university other than Clemson

300
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:06,159
that will test for carbohydrates and and

301
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,079
um the pieces that can lead you down

302
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:13,439
that road of starch to sugar conversion

303
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:17,638
and you know what I truly think is the

304
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,760
the guts to what is equating to a a good

305
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,839
cure got it yeah so it comes down to

306
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,198
personal preference I personally like

307
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,839
mostly cloudy with a little bit of Amber

308
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:29,078
I talked to so many people who are just

309
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,120
like oh 10% Amber 20% Amber but yeah at

310
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:31,759
the end of the day it comes down to

311
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,120
personal preference like you had said

312
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,240
you know if you're looking at your

313
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,639
tricomes and you're counting them it can

314
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,919
be tricky sometimes because are you

315
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,399
looking at the top ones where you know

316
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:44,039
the light is directly hitting them are

317
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,879
you looking at a a inside piece or a

318
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,599
lower Bud because all that can be

319
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:49,759
different throughout the plant too that

320
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,600
makes sense now you mentioned the starch

321
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,519
to sugar conversion which kind of

322
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,879
relates to the next question I have here

323
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,839
which is in regards to Flushing the

324
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,078
plants before Harvest now there have

325
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:59,880
been some studies that came out in

326
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,319
regards to FL flushing the plants before

327
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,519
Harvest whether or not it's beneficial

328
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,278
I've talked to many guests in the past I

329
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,198
like to bring this question up because

330
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:10,519
each person kind of has their own little

331
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:12,759
little tidbits on it little insight on

332
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,078
it and so I wanted to ask you this are

333
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,879
there any benefits to Flushing your

334
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:19,559
plants before harvesting it you know

335
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:21,720
thus far there's been a couple studies

336
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:25,078
out about it and you know I think the

337
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,120
only true solid takeaway we can have is

338
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:30,039
that if you stop fertilizing two weeks

339
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,679
prior to harvest there's no differences

340
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:35,879
in what's been tested so far and so that

341
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:40,159
really is Turpin

342
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:42,559
canabo yield um with I believe Mike's

343
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,639
work Mike from Clemson his work was

344
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,599
showing that if you go further than two

345
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,039
weeks of fertilizer restriction then

346
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,639
you're going to start losing some yield

347
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:54,198
which makes sense um but right at that

348
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:57,480
two we Mark you're not losing yield and

349
00:13:54,198 --> 00:14:00,439
you're not losing any sort of potency um

350
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,120
so what that tells tell me is stop

351
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,079
wasting your fertilizer and you know

352
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,519
you're not having any negative from

353
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:12,399
doing it so why do it um

354
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,278
but again Theory and again again

355
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,278
something that this year we're going to

356
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:20,879
get done is looking at what else is

357
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:22,919
happening during that flushing process

358
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:26,480
um you know when you flush you see color

359
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:29,198
change you see um depending on how hard

360
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,440
and you know intense your flush is um

361
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:36,078
you'll see faster

362
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,880
ripening um and so it's my theory that

363
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,159
that is in fact what's happening is

364
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:41,919
you're cutting off the nutrients a lot

365
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:45,078
of times you're lowering the temperature

366
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,319
so the plant is being pushed into

367
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:49,000
maturation faster than it would be if it

368
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,399
were still getting all the nitrogen and

369
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,799
everything that um would be encouraging

370
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:57,440
it to stay um grow I say vegetatively

371
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:00,198
but I don't mean it being in this

372
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,199
vegetative form I just mean in bulk um

373
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:05,838
you're not pushing that nitrogen for

374
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,838
excess growth the plant thinks it's fall

375
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,320
they think oh no it's time to you know

376
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:15,279
close up shop and protect these seeds so

377
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:19,120
we need to ripen so I would expect I

378
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:22,399
suspect that flushing does help to push

379
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,959
maturation that then changes those

380
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,039
carbohydrates um from being starches to

381
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,479
sugars I also think there's some play in

382
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:31,799
that as well

383
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,240
um the starch the sugar conversion in

384
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:38,519
those I don't know probably first 5 days

385
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:41,799
or so of drying um because it is still

386
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:45,959
active um you know it's it's difficult

387
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:48,159
to to say when a plant is dead because

388
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:49,799
it depends on how you know it all

389
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,879
depends on how much water is in It

390
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:54,639
ultimately you know is this thing alive

391
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:56,078
or not due to the water and it due to

392
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,839
the water supporting some of the

393
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:02,479
enzymatic activities that can happen um

394
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,720
so I would expect you know those last

395
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,959
few weeks of growing and then those

396
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,240
first few weeks of of dry first couple

397
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:12,758
of weeks of drying to really be when

398
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,879
those changes are happening um and like

399
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:18,680
I said it's been a couple year Mission

400
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:22,159
trying to uh get the right testing

401
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:23,919
available for this plant specifically to

402
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,919
be able to check that that's really

403
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,000
interesting yeah ever since that study

404
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,318
came out by RX screen Technologies back

405
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,078
in 201 20 in regards it really showed no

406
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:33,679
difference between the two I actually

407
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,838
made a video on it and I talked about

408
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,278
how yeah well the same Viewpoint as you

409
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,360
it's like well you can save money on

410
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,360
fertilizer why feed the plant up until

411
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,159
the end if it's not doing anything

412
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,720
differently for you the respones I got

413
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:47,879
off of that was hilarious but now it

414
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,079
seems like the biggest argument is the

415
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:52,000
starch to sugar conversion and right now

416
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,159
we just don't have the data to back that

417
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,919
up and it's interesting that that's the

418
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,399
route that you're trying to go to

419
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,120
actively research and see if there is

420
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:00,318
anything there so looking forward to

421
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,879
seeing what comes out of there in the

422
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:04,359
future yeah it should be interesting now

423
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,078
what about giving the plants a period of

424
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:07,958
darkness before Harvest that's another

425
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,879
thing that folks do in order to try to

426
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,640
achieve a better result here are a

427
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,919
varying number of reasons why people do

428
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,839
it but 24 hours of darkness before

429
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,559
Harvest 48 Hours of darkness before

430
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,720
Harvest some people do even longer than

431
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:21,720
that is there any benefit at all to

432
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,078
giving your plants a period of darkness

433
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,279
before Harvest

434
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,918
uh you know again it's been one of those

435
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,879
things i' I've kind of sat on the fence

436
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:34,038
about um could see the the benefit of

437
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,720
why and again I I would lend it towards

438
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:39,279
being an act to encourage

439
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,798
maturation

440
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:44,759
um you know we're we're digging deeper

441
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:48,359
into trying to

442
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:52,558
understand what the the outer structure

443
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:54,798
of the the triome gland um you know how

444
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:57,720
it's composed what it's made out of and

445
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:59,079
what really encourages it to crack or

446
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,720
not

447
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:04,960
um and and a lot of that works with

448
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:08,000
canol um but you know I think there's

449
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:12,759
there's something to be found about it

450
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,400
it it strength um and with proper curing

451
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:17,759
and harvesting not disturbing it making

452
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,519
it stronger and more

453
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,919
encapsulated um you know it's always

454
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,119
been interesting when you go into

455
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,840
drawing rooms of large facilities you

456
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:30,439
know you just smell it a mile down the

457
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:33,079
road and if it's the day of of uh

458
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,600
Harvest or you know day after whatever

459
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:37,240
um and you can smell it and you know my

460
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,839
my thoughts always well if it's in my

461
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,720
nose it's not in the plant you know

462
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,720
there's TPS in the air and it's not like

463
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,839
they're continuing to make these turpins

464
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,720
and so you know at some point it's going

465
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:54,199
to be spent um and so if we're able to

466
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:58,000
preserve that triom head better you know

467
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,720
does that make your quality last longer

468
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,839
um that's something that that we're

469
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:06,679
digging deep to and it's hard I mean the

470
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:08,759
it's tiny it's tiny and so you know

471
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:11,159
learning the scanning electron uh

472
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,440
microscopy and and really digging into

473
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:14,799
that this past year and this year has

474
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,840
been an

475
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:20,400
eyeopener um and understanding again how

476
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,558
much we don't understand and being able

477
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,000
to see in detail that close cuz there

478
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,119
are there are some drawbacks from it too

479
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,319
as as cool as the pictures look look

480
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,839
it's also not the whole story yeah

481
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:32,519
that's crazy there's still a lot so many

482
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:34,639
people out there that prefer the

483
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:36,400
darkness before Harvest and they're kind

484
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,799
of blind in the fact on whether or not

485
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,720
it is beneficial so I guess that debate

486
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:44,639
is going to is going to be ongoing from

487
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,120
here I think so so any overall tips for

488
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,480
harvesting or anything we kind of need

489
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:50,519
to know about about harvesting before we

490
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,079
move on to drying and curing you know I

491
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:56,639
think I think for harvesting drying it's

492
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,639
is delicate you know you you've got to

493
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,120
think of even if it's 10 minutes where

494
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,640
you've placed it in the sun you know if

495
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,399
if we're talking about for smokable

496
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:10,320
flower um 10 minutes in the sun could do

497
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:13,320
a ton of damage so you know being being

498
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:16,000
fast at making your moves and you know

499
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:18,359
being delicate and consistent with

500
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,759
everything okay now let's move on to

501
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:22,959
drying talk to us about the goal of

502
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:24,640
drying really water activity is one of

503
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,880
the things that come to mind right away

504
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,759
so can you talk to us about you know

505
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,520
what water activity is and kind of the

506
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:33,319
overall goal of it and so on and so

507
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:35,200
forth yeah so you know drying is the

508
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:37,639
first thing that comes to mind is like

509
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,558
you said water activity for the point of

510
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,919
not

511
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,079
spoiling so we're getting the water out

512
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:46,200
just like we would any other Foods

513
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:49,839
raisins whatever it may be um getting it

514
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:54,120
down low enough to where um it does not

515
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:56,959
support proliferation of microbes um now

516
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:59,000
drying does not kill microbes um there's

517
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,798
lots of spores and bacteria that are

518
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,798
super hearty um and we can dry it down

519
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:05,759
to a crisp and those spores are still

520
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:09,319
going to be there so once it's

521
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:11,240
rehydrated they could take over um but

522
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:13,839
the point is to get that water activity

523
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,440
low enough to to not support other life

524
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,199
growing on it um and that's really the

525
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,759
difference between water activity and

526
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,840
moisture content you know they're

527
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:25,440
they're very related but the difference

528
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:28,918
there is um available water for microbes

529
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:32,159
to to uh persist in so goal KCK M from

530
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:34,840
WR is 6 water activity and that

531
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,760
prohibits the growth of moles and yeasts

532
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:40,359
and so on and so forth yes yep that is

533
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,519
today's goal okay now are there any

534
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:45,240
tools that Growers can purchase in order

535
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:48,879
to measure water activity yeah uh

536
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:51,519
moisture content meters are pretty

537
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,320
inexpensive but they are also very

538
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,759
damaging um to get a proper reading you

539
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:58,839
almost have to take a full bud and you

540
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:02,119
know uh squeeze it it as tight as you

541
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:05,158
can and then stick the prongs in um but

542
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:08,918
again then you're ruining a bud um and

543
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:11,120
that's not a great thing um the other

544
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:14,320
thing which is you know it's got it

545
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:16,959
drawbacks too is a water activity meter

546
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:20,119
um and they can be quite pricey

547
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,000
$1,000 on up you know $10,000 for a

548
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:25,719
really high-end one um so those aren't

549
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,359
my preference either um at least in the

550
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:32,319
hom grower space you know the it it's

551
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:34,678
Overkill um one thing I like to do is

552
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,480
put your plants in the drying room bring

553
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:39,120
it down to where you think it's just

554
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,480
about right and if you debut your

555
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:43,158
flowers put it in a jar and then have a

556
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,960
humidistat in the

557
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:51,278
jar once once you see the humidity level

558
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:54,000
stabilize that is your uh water activity

559
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:55,558
so your humidity then turns into the uh

560
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,200
water activity I mean you got to move

561
00:22:55,558 --> 00:23:00,480
the decimal two points but um um

562
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,798
ultimately it's the same so if you have

563
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:07,798
a jar put a few buds in there and it

564
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:09,558
reads 70% humidity after it's leveled um

565
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:11,879
because there'll be a a time of

566
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:14,158
fluctuation uh for the moisture to

567
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,240
homogenize throughout but once you get

568
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,200
to that homogenized state if it reads

569
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,839
70% let's say then you're at a 7 water

570
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,679
activity and you you might want to keep

571
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,079
the lid open for a couple of days or

572
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,440
that sort of thing got it yeah I think

573
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:30,639
that's what a lot of hom Growers are

574
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,600
doing today some pretty straightforward

575
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,360
there really from what you're telling me

576
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:36,959
it's not really worth it to go and spend

577
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:38,558
money on a moisture meter a water

578
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,440
activity meter for the average hom

579
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:43,000
grower just putting the your buzz in the

580
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,798
jar and and getting that humidity down

581
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,640
you're safe at that point so for drying

582
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:50,918
conditions you know temperature humidity

583
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,200
what are the ideal dry conditions you

584
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:56,080
know I think the the traditional 6060

585
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,558
that everybody's been using for forever

586
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:03,119
um it works it works

587
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:07,319
Five Points either way also works um you

588
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:09,278
know I think being able to go slower on

589
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:12,720
the days it takes to fully remove a

590
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:15,640
certain amount of water um could is

591
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,919
beneficial for Turing retention uh

592
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,840
because the faster you're bringer

593
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,038
bringing that water out the faster you

594
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:24,918
potentially could be volatilizing your

595
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:29,278
tarping off too so um I think there's a

596
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:34,080
a nice medium point which 66 de it

597
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:36,480
achieves well um you know I think the

598
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,199
time will come where we start to

599
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,558
understand again how delicate these

600
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,159
tricomes are you know one thing that you

601
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:46,720
get when you're using very traditional

602
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,039
systems you know let's say a a mini

603
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,880
split and a

604
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:52,519
de when you're looking at tracking over

605
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,520
time even though your set points might

606
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:56,839
be

607
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,200
6060 you've got these these pieces of

608
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:01,000
equipment fighting each each other all

609
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,558
the time you've got the AC coming on

610
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,440
it's getting cooler but then the

611
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:09,359
humidity is also Rising because the

612
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,679
humidifier is off or the de is off and

613
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:14,278
then it switches places because then

614
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,720
it's you know then the de kicks on but

615
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:19,319
then that makes the room hot um so it's

616
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,159
this constant cycle of on and off where

617
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:25,639
you're also seeing these huge spikes up

618
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:28,600
and down um so I kind of like to think

619
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,520
of it like a balloon um um if you have a

620
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:34,519
balloon filled with helium and you go

621
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:36,918
outside and it's a um you know a humid

622
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:39,038
day versus a notum day the balloon will

623
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:42,240
will float and it will expand and

624
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:44,679
contract and um that's how I think of

625
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,960
the Tricom head is expanding and

626
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:49,919
Contracting um because of this

627
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,278
environment and at some point the

628
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,880
expanding and

629
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:56,919
Contracting will cause cracks and you

630
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,120
know these small cracks how much how

631
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:02,440
much Tarpin you know H how's the loss um

632
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:05,278
and so that's what I'm really

633
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,480
interesting interested in is taking a

634
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,398
step further than just seeing humidity

635
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,000
and temperature and understanding the

636
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:15,719
pressure that goes behind it um because

637
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,759
all of that is is wrapped around VPD and

638
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,440
um really understanding the internal

639
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:23,798
pressure of what's in that cell and the

640
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:27,000
the outside room pressure and not

641
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:30,639
causing those swings to be so intense so

642
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,319
stability is kind of more important than

643
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,960
the temperature and humidity and the gr

644
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:36,439
schem of things cuz like you had

645
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,240
mentioned going and a lot of these folks

646
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,519
that are drying in tents they're having

647
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,519
just that happen for me I have my

648
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,918
humidifer kick on fans are going around

649
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:46,319
sometimes I have exhaust fan come out

650
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,919
I'm exchanging the air but there's a lot

651
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,678
of swings happening you know and it

652
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,080
might be one or two degrees but those

653
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:57,240
one to two degrees could be rupturing

654
00:26:53,079 --> 00:27:00,439
Tricom heads right exactly so overall

655
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,640
What would be the ideal length of dry in

656
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:06,159
number of days I've heard anywhere from

657
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:09,038
7 to 14 days I hear 5 to 10 days we know

658
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,720
the downsides of drying too quickly

659
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:12,398
versus trying too long and maybe you can

660
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,440
get into to that to begin and then let

661
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:17,558
us know what the ideal dry time day is

662
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,798
in yeah so I'd love to share with you

663
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:22,079
maybe you can squeeze into the talk um

664
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:25,038
it's a graph we put out where it looks

665
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,359
at Days 1 to 14 um it's looking at

666
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,919
humidity and temperature and and

667
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:31,879
correlates the the V PD and it shows you

668
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:36,200
know if you go out 14

669
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:38,039
days um it equates to this VPD and so on

670
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,319
and so it shows kind of right in the

671
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:44,200
middle there at 7 Days um if you are at

672
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:47,918
that 6060 Mark you should be able to

673
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:52,759
achieve it within 7 Days um it's a

674
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:54,759
really useful to Tool um but you know

675
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:57,038
obviously you can you can go further

676
00:27:54,759 --> 00:28:00,038
than Le let's say you're at 60 60 and

677
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:02,960
you go eight days well each day you go

678
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:05,200
past you're bringing more and more water

679
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,679
out of that flow and you may think okay

680
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:12,159
well I can just rehydrate it at some

681
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:15,679
point um but we're starting to see a lot

682
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:19,640
of extreme rehydration can cause a lot

683
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:23,000
of Browning as well um and so being able

684
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:25,720
to pull it right at the right time and

685
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,240
having to dry it a little more is okay

686
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,919
but if you're having to really really

687
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,798
have to rehydrate it um you won't have

688
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,320
quite as great results so the goal is to

689
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:34,558
get it right where you want it right

690
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:36,960
when you pull it

691
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:40,158
from whatever drying environment you're

692
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,079
in now what about a 4day dry so I have

693
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,640
the canol I know you're familiar with

694
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,918
the citrol I've got one right back there

695
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,880
and I love it I've been using it for

696
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,600
over a year now real consistent dries

697
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,159
hands off as far as I'm not really

698
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:54,158
messing around with the equipment now

699
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,919
you know humidifier and fan and all that

700
00:28:54,159 --> 00:29:00,519
stuff but I think in their normal

701
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:03,919
settings 60 8° F and a 54 D point which

702
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:05,759
I believe is 61% Rh I think it's a 4-day

703
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,519
dry period and then it transitions over

704
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:11,038
to curing cycle and that's the default

705
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:15,120
settings that's what they recommend is 4

706
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:18,038
days too quick of a dry um you know I

707
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,719
don't I don't think it's too quick um

708
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:21,079
you know again we're we're working

709
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,759
through all of these nitty-gritty

710
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:28,000
details um with canot trol

711
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:32,599
um I I think anywhere between that four

712
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,278
and 10day Mark is is okay um and again

713
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:38,798
but until we can

714
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:42,720
say you truly need 5 days at a water

715
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:45,000
activity of8 to convert the starches to

716
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,720
sugars because that is what makes for

717
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,960
the better smoke it's it's hard to to

718
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,519
say there's much difference in in 3 days

719
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,200
as long as you're not drying it out too

720
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,839
much which I know their product doesn't

721
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,240
do um I also know their product doesn't

722
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:02,038
have the extreme swings um that the

723
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,880
traditional equipment does that's that's

724
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:08,599
part of you know what their purpose is

725
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:11,760
to have extremely um

726
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:15,519
consistent pressure um you know

727
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:17,480
VPD so no I don't I don't think it's too

728
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,599
short and you know I don't I don't think

729
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,880
we'll be able to measure that until we

730
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:26,519
kind of backtrack to what is what is a

731
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:28,360
smooth smoke all right quantify that and

732
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:31,599
then backtrack from there to say all

733
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:34,798
right well 5 days would allow this

734
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:40,879
process to fully develop to equate to

735
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:43,918
the perfect smoke at the end um so you

736
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,278
know sometimes I feel silly not having

737
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:50,159
answers but as a researcher you're

738
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,759
told you know you're told to be okay

739
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,720
with not having answers CU that's your

740
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,079
job is to find the answers not guess the

741
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,519
answers that makes total sense now on

742
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:00,720
the other side you had mentioned 4 to 10

743
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:04,079
days and a lot of folks are are drying

744
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,639
for longer than that 14 plus days now I

745
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:09,038
heard from Dr James f one of the talks

746
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:11,278
that he had he said the same thing same

747
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:13,319
window I'm pretty sure was 4 to 10 days

748
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,359
he talks about some of the D the dangers

749
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:18,278
of drying longer than that can you get

750
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:21,199
into that what happens after 10 days

751
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:23,240
when you're still drying yeah yeah so

752
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,319
there's certain danger if if you're

753
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,558
going out longer than 10 or 14 days and

754
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:30,759
the reason that is is because any

755
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,480
microbe that you had in your grow you're

756
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:37,960
taking it with you into the drawing room

757
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:40,919
and the longer you have this Bud sitting

758
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,960
wet um the more potential you have for

759
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:48,639
Bettis growth and and P proliferation

760
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:50,960
all throughout the entire Bud um for the

761
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:53,798
most part in traditional drying scents

762
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,600
when you're drying out a large bud it's

763
00:31:53,798 --> 00:31:58,480
the outside of that bud that's drying

764
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:00,599
first and then the inside side and so

765
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,399
that's why when I say put the buds in a

766
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:05,000
jar and and wait a day or so until it

767
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:07,038
levels out is because all of that

768
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,880
moisture that's in the interior of the

769
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:11,000
bud is then coming to the outside and it

770
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,480
it's it's

771
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,480
equalizing um and so if if you're

772
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:21,120
leaving the center of that bud at you

773
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:23,919
know 88 water activity or even higher

774
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:26,119
you know every minute is a second the

775
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,480
betrus or Fus serum or whatever you

776
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:31,199
might have um could could really take

777
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,519
over and and cause problems got it yeah

778
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,278
that's one thing that I don't even risk

779
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,638
I usually go around seven days sometimes

780
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:39,200
10 days at the max but if it's going on

781
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:40,678
Long longer than that I'm concerned and

782
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,278
I'm actually checking inside the buds

783
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:45,440
and looking for visual although that

784
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,880
could be there it can be microscopic

785
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,679
level it's more than just a naked eye

786
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,320
you know it could be there without us

787
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,320
even seeing it so scary so you've done a

788
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:56,240
lot of work with krol I know you've done

789
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,879
a study with them that's actually on the

790
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,480
website kroll.com resesarch if I

791
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,000
remember correctly real brief we I think

792
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,120
a lot of people looking for more details

793
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,440
in regards to that so can you break us

794
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:09,359
down what that study entailed I believe

795
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,440
it was the canol versus the traditional

796
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:15,398
6060 method there was I think 16% higher

797
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:18,240
tarpine content in the canol drying can

798
00:33:15,398 --> 00:33:20,439
you talk to us about that yeah so that

799
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,480
that was first stab at you know really

800
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,519
trying to understand um their unit and

801
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,519
the flower it creates and and that sort

802
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:30,638
of thing

803
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,558
and so you know first stab is well let's

804
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:34,879
dry and cure at you know the two

805
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:36,240
different methods traditional and and

806
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,639
the canol

807
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:43,159
system and let's test what happens and

808
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:44,719
the problem they encountered and uh

809
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:47,240
problems we've seen other companies

810
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,679
encounter when testing tpin is that if

811
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:53,720
you don't have your own internal lab

812
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,960
there can be a lot of problems um and so

813
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:00,120
you know you think about a a dried

814
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:05,240
flower it's got 2% 4% whatever it may be

815
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:07,398
uh um by dry weight of Tarpin which is

816
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:11,519
yeah that's a small number if we're

817
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:14,519
looking at 100% 2% is very small um and

818
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:16,800
so if we're mailing samples even if you

819
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:20,519
overnight it with ice something's going

820
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,359
to happen and so any of effect that

821
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:25,039
could happen during transit or even if

822
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:27,039
it's just being drove somewhere anything

823
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,679
within Transit is going to affect the

824
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:32,079
turpine levels the other thing to think

825
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,398
about is you know there's lots of great

826
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,200
Labs out there but there's some that

827
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:37,638
will grab your samples and maybe

828
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:41,078
treatment one sits on the counter for an

829
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:42,800
hour maybe treatment two doesn't um and

830
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,440
so if we're looking at getting true

831
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,720
results on just

832
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:51,240
2% um that can cause a lot of problems a

833
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:53,918
lot of skewed errors and so the way we

834
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:56,959
overcame that is that U we work with a

835
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:59,799
lab katcha and I told them you know I

836
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,519
want to do the extraction at my lab and

837
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,320
then I want to send you the liquid

838
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:06,480
because the LI the solvent the solvent's

839
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,680
not going to lose turpins it's going to

840
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,559
be true to what exactly it was the

841
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:14,319
second I pull it from whatever treatment

842
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:17,279
is in um and so that's what we send to

843
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,240
the lab those are tested um and so we

844
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,040
can have very accurate results and then

845
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:23,679
of course have duplicates to uh to make

846
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:27,639
sure there's

847
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:29,480
no off off problems so that's how we did

848
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:31,279
the tpping testing and that's the only

849
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,480
thing that made me feel comfortable to

850
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,920
do tpping testing CU it's so

851
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,039
tricky um but yeah so getting results

852
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,159
back

853
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:44,759
from 7 Days traditionally drying and 7

854
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:47,598
Days in the

855
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,920
canol that's the results we got um the

856
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,838
other thing that you got to be super

857
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,480
careful about and and ask questions um

858
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:55,960
when you're looking at any study like

859
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,679
this is well what was what was the water

860
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:02,760
content because that can also skew the

861
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:07,519
numbers so for example if in the canol

862
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:09,839
it's a perfect Point 61 water activity

863
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:12,759
and in traditional drying uh let's say

864
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:15,759
it went down to 058 you know that might

865
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,560
not seem like a lot but in water weight

866
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,240
that will certainly certainly skew the

867
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,400
result so we made sure we had all of

868
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:25,118
those bases covered to where we're truly

869
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,079
just looking at uh the tping that the

870
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:31,079
plant produced um um compared to one to

871
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:35,640
the other and so that's the results we

872
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:37,560
got was 133% um across the board Tarpin

873
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:40,318
um each each individual tarpine there

874
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:43,119
was some you know skewed but overall

875
00:36:40,318 --> 00:36:45,318
that certainly was the result okay now

876
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,640
is there a like a white paper that folks

877
00:36:45,318 --> 00:36:49,440
can reference and and read more deeply

878
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:53,039
into it is it was a peer reviewed or

879
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,000
anything we're going to duplicate it um

880
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:57,318
so we had we had reps within the study

881
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,760
but we want to duplicate it again before

882
00:36:57,318 --> 00:37:02,440
the final white paper mhm yeah it's good

883
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,520
to have a couple reps like that just cuz

884
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,159
you never know what could have went

885
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:08,159
wrong along the way and this is how you

886
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:09,358
catch any problems that you may have

887
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,279
exactly yeah that's one thing I

888
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:13,759
mentioned in uh handful of videos now is

889
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,720
science is repeatable you need to be

890
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,200
able to take that and repeat it over and

891
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:20,838
over and over again in order for it to

892
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:22,480
be fact EXA one study isn't just fact

893
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:23,880
right once study could say anything it

894
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,000
could be wrong it could have there could

895
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,160
have been something that went wrong with

896
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,760
it and then it might another study might

897
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:30,920
come out and it it's not repeated

898
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,400
results right so yeah I think you're

899
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,159
you're doing your due diligence doing

900
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,639
things right in regards to making sure

901
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:38,279
that it can be replicated and then uh

902
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:40,799
and then going from there so looking

903
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,240
forward to to reading the final paper

904
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,680
yeah yeah no it was it was great results

905
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:49,159
I was I was impressed I did make a video

906
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:51,000
on this actually and uh some viewers

907
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:53,039
were concerned they mentioned that was a

908
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,960
conflict of interest a little bit since

909
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:58,279
katrol paid for the research so could

910
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,159
you kind of explain how that works so

911
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,359
CRC you mentioned that you are the owner

912
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:06,118
of the CRC you did the research for

913
00:38:02,358 --> 00:38:08,799
katrol katrol pays money towards the CRC

914
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,358
for the research to happen I understand

915
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,039
how some people can consider that a

916
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:13,960
conflict of interest but like in this

917
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:17,079
industry how difficult it is to get

918
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,240
funding and the barriers you face in

919
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:20,160
regards to this like there's no

920
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:22,000
Government funding for you guys versus

921
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:23,879
like other Industries like food and

922
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,039
beverage there's so much more Government

923
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,480
funding and towards scientists and

924
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:29,318
research velopment and all that stuff

925
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,838
can you kind of break that I know it a

926
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:33,039
little messy explanation there but can

927
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:37,000
you kind of break down how that all

928
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:41,599
works yeah yeah so funding is hard it's

929
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,880
it's extremely hard um you know USDA

930
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,720
likes to say that there are hemp grants

931
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:49,880
out there but they are not um they're

932
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:52,399
mainly for fiber and Seed production um

933
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,000
and so if we're talking

934
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,838
floral

935
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,318
research um there is nothing there as

936
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:01,719
far as the government goes so our

937
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:06,239
choices are donations

938
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:08,759
from anyone right anyone can donate um

939
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:11,598
and that's that's our our our general

940
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,760
donations is for our association and so

941
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:18,680
so that's for research that is not

942
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,480
coming requested by a company it's just

943
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:24,039
something that you know the Growers

944
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,760
might say ah rud AIDS we want x amount

945
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:29,480
of our funding this year to go towards

946
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,319
you looking at rude Aphid control

947
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:36,159
da um but then as I was saying earlier

948
00:39:32,318 --> 00:39:39,679
another tier is um third party

949
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:43,639
validation and so krol says Hey I want

950
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:45,598
to do this study um we want you to

951
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:49,199
perform it and give us results and I say

952
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:53,119
that is great I will perform this study

953
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:55,960
um but in respect to their company I say

954
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,079
if if you don't get the results you want

955
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,119
then I'm just just going to keep my

956
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:01,800
mouth shut but if we get the results you

957
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,880
want you're you know I'll talk about the

958
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:08,039
work we've done um so there's no there's

959
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,039
no paying me for certain results there's

960
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:14,039
just respect

961
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:15,440
of use of results um and you know I

962
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:17,279
would just want to make it clear when

963
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,200
they pay for it it's not like I'm going

964
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,040
out and buying a new Volvo it's Volvo I

965
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:25,879
don't know where that came from new car

966
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:28,719
I don't know how i' buy a Volvo but um

967
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:31,358
you know this this pays for our research

968
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:33,919
the tests testing is extremely

969
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:35,920
expensive um and it supports Us in what

970
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,599
we're doing you know even though it is a

971
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,519
project for them the way I see it it's

972
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:42,838
really a project for the industry to

973
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:45,239
help to help to understand what's going

974
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:46,599
on I mean if they were paying me to give

975
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:50,279
results I would have probably went a

976
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:54,519
little higher than than 133% or

977
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:56,560
18% but um yeah so it's it's hard um and

978
00:40:54,519 --> 00:41:01,280
I understand people say ah so and so

979
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:03,519
sponsoring this this test but um I mean

980
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,920
all you can do is trust me when I say we

981
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:08,440
you know the results we give is what

982
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:12,800
science gave us and we're not falsifying

983
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:14,800
anything you know just's put it this way

984
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,400
I've been back in South Carolina six

985
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,920
years now and for the first 3 years

986
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,480
we've funded our own research um and I

987
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,760
felt like I've not gotten anywhere

988
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,920
because it's been slower than you know

989
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,160
if you had some huge government grant

990
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,559
but you know the stuff we sell on our

991
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:33,000
consumer good side that supports

992
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:34,838
research um simply because I like doing

993
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,960
it and I want to do it and I know

994
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:38,279
there's you know there's thousands of

995
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,559
people out there that this will

996
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,519
certainly help not to mention the

997
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:45,920
patients who take advantage of the plant

998
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:48,559
science that's discovered um and how

999
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,880
that trickles down all the way but you

1000
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:54,199
know the C CRC has been great for us it

1001
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,680
brings in a little extra money um and

1002
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:59,679
and helps us get down some of the

1003
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:01,919
problems we're having um so can I say

1004
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:03,480
it's not funded by someone no it's

1005
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,838
funded by someone bunch of different

1006
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:09,400
Growers different companies but I mean

1007
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:12,679
all of our money personally or not has

1008
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:16,200
to come from somewhere so um all I can

1009
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:18,239
do is show the viewers and readers of

1010
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:20,318
research you know throughout the over

1011
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:23,558
the years of of the research we're

1012
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:26,480
giving and and uh just keep giving good

1013
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:28,240
results and and helping Farmers um

1014
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,599
that's what we're trying to do I

1015
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:30,479
appreciate you breaking that down yeah I

1016
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,200
think there are a lot of people out

1017
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,240
there just kind of ignorant of that fact

1018
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:37,039
of how the research is funded and you

1019
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:39,399
know where the money comes from I was

1020
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:42,079
ignorant uh just a few months ago until

1021
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,039
I actually sat down and did the research

1022
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,119
and try to figure out that hey the

1023
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:48,079
government isn't spending money towards

1024
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:50,318
this industry like they are in other

1025
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,960
Industries so it's a lot harder for

1026
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:54,558
scientists to be able to conduct

1027
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,240
research and that's why it's so slow you

1028
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:57,960
know as far as doing the researching and

1029
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:59,519
getting information out there it's just

1030
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,639
there's no money here coming from the

1031
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:03,719
government that's really funding it like

1032
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:05,838
there are in other Industries so

1033
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:07,480
appreciate you breaking that down for us

1034
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:10,239
yeah and there there's no special

1035
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,838
research class that we can get in to you

1036
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:16,639
know have certain deductions

1037
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:19,400
or help with testing costs I mean

1038
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:23,400
cannaboids and tpin when test is 100

1039
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:26,838
bucks and carbohydrate tests is $400 per

1040
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,960
test so it's limit

1041
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:31,159
um so we appreciate everyone that can

1042
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,240
can help us out so we can't end the

1043
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:35,199
drying section until we talk about

1044
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:36,838
freeze drying a lot more and more people

1045
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:38,838
are talking about freeze drying what is

1046
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:42,639
freeze drying and is it really the

1047
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:44,799
future uh I I've played with it a lot I

1048
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:50,358
have

1049
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:53,839
um in my opinion I think for bubble has

1050
00:43:50,358 --> 00:43:56,880
I think for any sort of concentrate

1051
00:43:53,838 --> 00:44:00,519
extraction that it's great and and it's

1052
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:03,720
got a place now I've seen some companies

1053
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:06,440
go out and buy millions of dollars of

1054
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:08,679
equipment and freeze dryers just for

1055
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:12,800
outdoor smokable flour and I tell you

1056
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:14,879
the ROI is not there um so just to give

1057
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:19,160
you an idea I have a freeze dryer and

1058
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:23,640
it's just one of the you know small

1059
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:27,838
2x three maybe Harvest rights um and

1060
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:30,920
that is $3,500 with the pump and

1061
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:35,480
everything um and it'll hold what a

1062
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:39,440
pound and it takes 24 to 48 hours to run

1063
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,480
the one pound so you can imagine um just

1064
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,400
a two

1065
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:46,880
lighter you know how how long and how

1066
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:49,760
expensive that process is so from a

1067
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:53,200
standpoint of Roi and making your money

1068
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:56,920
back I can't see how that could be

1069
00:44:53,199 --> 00:45:01,159
feasible um from a flower standpoint it

1070
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:03,119
keeps it the greenest I've ever seen um

1071
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:05,480
but it's also very tricky to get the set

1072
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,119
points just right um I've done it and

1073
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,960
I've seen a lot of people do it where

1074
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,680
you put it through the process and it's

1075
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:15,480
you know just it's just

1076
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:17,598
dust um but it it it keeps the plan

1077
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,960
exactly how it is when you harvest it

1078
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,359
let's just put it that way so if we are

1079
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,400
finding that certain things like starch

1080
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:26,679
sugar

1081
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:28,920
conversions um other certain aspects

1082
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:30,399
like that are important for that smoke

1083
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:34,159
you're certainly not going to get it

1084
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:37,200
with a freeze dryer um because again it

1085
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:40,639
it pauses it in time you know any any

1086
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:42,279
set starch that's there will be there at

1087
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:44,400
the at the end of the freeze during

1088
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,559
cycle wow so it could actually be a bad

1089
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,318
thing it could be well interesting well

1090
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:51,440
it's priced too high for me so I'm not

1091
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:53,239
going to be doing any time soon I think

1092
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,760
it's yeah for the average hom grower I

1093
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:57,279
mean that that price is is crazy maybe

1094
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,160
the the future it'll come down you know

1095
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,960
there'll be competition more people

1096
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:03,679
releasing freeze drying machines but uh

1097
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,599
as of right now yeah I think it's kind

1098
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:07,318
of price a little bit too high and too

1099
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,519
lengthy of a process for the average

1100
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:13,599
home grower agreed so moving on to

1101
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:17,039
curing what is curing and what happens

1102
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:20,800
during it so in my eyes curing is is not

1103
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:23,519
just dry curing separated you know very

1104
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,920
discrete separate times of treatment to

1105
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:28,199
the flower uh it's really post Harvest

1106
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,400
handling so

1107
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:34,919
um it it all comes to go

1108
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:37,480
together with looking at the changes

1109
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:40,280
that are happening the the carbohydrate

1110
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:44,920
status um it's going from a very wet

1111
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:46,880
plant where changes are fast to a more

1112
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,880
dry plant where the changes are slowing

1113
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,880
down because the water's not there and

1114
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,800
available to let those enzymatic

1115
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:56,400
processes happen

1116
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,839
um

1117
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:02,599
and so in my mind it's it's a it's a

1118
00:46:58,838 --> 00:47:06,000
onef swoop um in order to prepare the

1119
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:10,359
flower for use

1120
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,199
um so you know people will say oh it's

1121
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:17,558
for

1122
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:20,358
um for sweating for um just very

1123
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:22,480
generalized answers making the flower

1124
00:47:20,358 --> 00:47:25,759
better but you know again here I am in

1125
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:29,480
my stance of that's my guess of of

1126
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:32,200
carbohydrate change um but won't

1127
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:35,358
necessarily be able to answer that 100%

1128
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:39,558
confidence until next year I say next

1129
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:42,920
year uh 123 25 we get on this talk again

1130
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:44,359
and um I'm hoping we have very different

1131
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,680
or actually I'm hoping we have the same

1132
00:47:44,358 --> 00:47:49,960
answers just with some data and details

1133
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:51,598
behind it well we know that burping

1134
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,679
there is things that are happening right

1135
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,440
so burping a lot of folks know about

1136
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:59,279
this basic method to where after it's

1137
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:01,679
dried it's putting into a jar turkey bag

1138
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,839
or Grove bags and they're actually

1139
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:05,279
removing the lid of the jar and off

1140
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:07,599
gassing has happened and I know there's

1141
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,400
been studies I think it was Dr James fa

1142
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:12,760
who is talking about the studies done

1143
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:14,838
the off gasing the CO2 levels O2 levels

1144
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:19,319
ethylene are you able to talk about any

1145
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:22,799
of that yeah so ethylene is you know I

1146
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:24,679
don't think it's looked at enough um and

1147
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:30,000
I understand why it's very tricky to

1148
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:31,960
measure uh but if you look at cuting so

1149
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,880
poinsetta cuting that are shipped from

1150
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,720
Guatemala to the us for our Christmas

1151
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:40,400
poinsettas if you're thinking

1152
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:42,799
about those pieces of plant um fruits

1153
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,400
and vegetables there's so much money and

1154
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:48,800
so many businesses that exist just to

1155
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:50,440
control ethylene um because it is in

1156
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,480
short a ripening

1157
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:56,880
agent um we have been able to measure

1158
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,199
ethylene and so we know that

1159
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,640
ethylene uh the amount that's produced

1160
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:06,279
is Extreme in growing and

1161
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:10,440
drying not as much as when the plant has

1162
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:12,319
dried out so during curing really um so

1163
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,280
we know the levels are extremely high

1164
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:17,759
but we don't know if that is a good

1165
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:20,440
thing or if it is a bad thing um because

1166
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,160
maybe we do want the plant to ripen

1167
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:24,318
which then is doing all of its

1168
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:26,639
conversions it needs to by having this

1169
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:29,759
push of Ethylene

1170
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:32,440
or is it beneficial actually to get down

1171
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,720
to a certain drying point and then stop

1172
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,798
the ethylene

1173
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:39,239
production um because you don't want it

1174
00:49:36,798 --> 00:49:41,599
to go too far but again what are those

1175
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:43,798
metric points along the graph that we

1176
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:48,640
need to know here

1177
00:49:43,798 --> 00:49:52,920
stop um and so Dr F and I share an

1178
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:54,639
ethylene sensor and it uh it's finicky

1179
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,480
it's finicky you need a little bit of

1180
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:59,719
humidity you don't zero it out properly

1181
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,760
it throws crazy numbers so I feel like

1182
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:06,039
it's been a boot camp just learning how

1183
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:09,359
to use it properly um so that is is

1184
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:13,119
going to be a a goal this year um we're

1185
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:15,960
doing a study with a company that that H

1186
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:18,240
that makes post Harvest let's just say I

1187
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:21,440
can't announce who yet but curing

1188
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:23,039
containers um and they're very excited

1189
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,000
about the thought of ethylene and what

1190
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:29,079
it could do or does but again it's just

1191
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,159
an exploration experiment it's not we're

1192
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:34,480
producing a product for them to

1193
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:37,318
implement um and so to be H this goes

1194
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,358
back to our our previous conversation is

1195
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:42,400
you know a lot of the sponsorship money

1196
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:43,880
is simply going towards exploration

1197
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:47,960
because we don't know what the starting

1198
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:51,240
points are yet to to alter that one way

1199
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:54,079
or the other um so you know experiment

1200
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:56,558
one is putting flour in different types

1201
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,000
of containers and doing do measurements

1202
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:00,960
and that gives you your

1203
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,079
Baseline where uh after that you can say

1204
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:07,679
all right well at day five let's jack up

1205
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:11,680
the ethylene content and um see what

1206
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:14,039
changes happened so yeah ethylene I

1207
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:17,639
believe is um a very

1208
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:21,039
important gas we need to take in account

1209
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:22,920
um and and start to figure out and

1210
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:27,239
hopefully again this is the year to do

1211
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:31,639
it um but O2 and CO2 to is also very

1212
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:34,078
important um you know it's I would

1213
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:36,159
encourage you if you have a sensor and

1214
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,720
as a home grower especially because if

1215
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:41,480
you're using a mini

1216
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:43,279
split um you're recirculating that air

1217
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,240
and so even though you're recirculating

1218
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,400
that air and you're adding your CO2

1219
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:49,479
because your plants are taking the CO2

1220
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:53,039
away what does that mean about your

1221
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:54,920
ethylene are you also just compounding

1222
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:58,000
your ethylene content since you're not

1223
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,838
actually bringing in uh fresh sourced

1224
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,880
air I was talking with a

1225
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:08,838
grower uh probably within the past year

1226
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:10,838
and he has a a dry room that went out of

1227
00:52:08,838 --> 00:52:14,119
commission so he had to use an old dry

1228
00:52:10,838 --> 00:52:15,599
an old growing room to dry in well

1229
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:19,318
because it was a growing room he had a

1230
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:22,079
CO2 sensor in there and the numbers that

1231
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:23,759
the plants drying or producing which he

1232
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:26,640
would never would have looked at the CO2

1233
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:29,559
content if it had not and in him dry in

1234
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:33,279
the grow room which measures it um and

1235
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:36,960
the numbers were like well past what's

1236
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:39,119
safe for a human to go in um and so you

1237
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:42,880
know again I don't know what

1238
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:45,400
that what does that equate to exactly I

1239
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,920
don't know but when you have levels of

1240
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,960
anything out of whack so extreme you

1241
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,599
need to understand and be able to apply

1242
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:55,559
apply optimization behind it and so it

1243
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:58,039
it's just it's wild being in an industry

1244
00:52:55,559 --> 00:53:00,280
that we're still on many things

1245
00:52:58,039 --> 00:53:03,318
extraction you know especially on the

1246
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:06,000
patient side patients understanding all

1247
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:10,358
the different canabo everything at

1248
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,599
exploration right now um so yeah it's

1249
00:53:10,358 --> 00:53:15,679
exciting but it's frustrating having to

1250
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:18,039
repeat you don't know so many times but

1251
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:20,078
none of us do right yeah still a lot to

1252
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:21,440
learn still a lot to uncover and I agree

1253
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,280
with you very exciting that's one of the

1254
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,358
reasons why I like to be in this

1255
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,079
industry you know I said in my videos

1256
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:28,480
times in the past is doing the same

1257
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:30,599
thing over and over again I mean that

1258
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,599
gets boring to me being able to learn

1259
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:35,400
new things un cover new things try new

1260
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:37,559
ways to grow it's exciting it's fun for

1261
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,559
me and so it makes a job more enjoyable

1262
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:41,319
so yeah looking forward to seeing what

1263
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:44,000
gets uncovered there in the future so

1264
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:48,239
with so many different ways to cure or

1265
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:50,798
store jars turkey bags Grove bags what

1266
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:52,719
have you found to be the best method and

1267
00:53:50,798 --> 00:53:55,639
then are there any of those methods that

1268
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:58,879
you would say aren't good to do and you

1269
00:53:55,639 --> 00:54:00,318
should avoid um you know it always comes

1270
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,200
back to there's a there's a million ways

1271
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:06,119
to skin a cat um and a lot of my work is

1272
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:09,000
is really working with the the large

1273
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:14,318
scale Growers who you know is looking at

1274
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:17,760
every penny spent um so for example sake

1275
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:19,960
even though stainless still is great and

1276
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,440
it's easily cleanable and it doesn't

1277
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:25,838
break like glass and it does a good job

1278
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,798
you know would it be possible for a

1279
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:30,358
commercial grower to go out and buy all

1280
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:33,639
stainless steel containers for thousands

1281
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:37,199
of pounds no probably not so you know a

1282
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:40,639
lot of my time and work is spent looking

1283
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:43,118
at those limitations of of really

1284
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:46,719
commercializing on a large scale and

1285
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:49,720
making the best call based from that um

1286
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:52,159
now if I'm at home and I'm growing my

1287
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:54,078
own and I'm putting it in my own you

1288
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:57,078
know resource that's available there for

1289
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,079
me and there's no

1290
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:03,760
limitations I probably would use glass I

1291
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:04,598
probably would use glass yeah I would

1292
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,520
use

1293
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:09,798
glass so that that's my short personal

1294
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:12,719
answer um but that's not always the

1295
00:55:09,798 --> 00:55:14,440
answer for large production got it yeah

1296
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:16,118
I know you hear through the grave Vine

1297
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,960
of people being concerned about

1298
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:20,960
microplastics you know so the turkey

1299
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:22,358
bags Grove bags so on and so forth but

1300
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,119
from what I'm understanding there's no

1301
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:26,920
really research to back that up that's

1302
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:28,079
just kind of a theory at this point so

1303
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,720
it be interesting to see if anything

1304
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:32,200
gets uncovered there you know that that

1305
00:55:29,719 --> 00:55:34,199
would be terrible if microplastics were

1306
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:35,798
leaking in there and we're consuming

1307
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:37,239
them and there always something to worry

1308
00:55:35,798 --> 00:55:40,199
about

1309
00:55:37,239 --> 00:55:42,318
yeah storage want to ask you one more

1310
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:44,399
question in regards to storage so

1311
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:47,838
storage temperature a lot of people

1312
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,280
store in you know 60° Fahrenheit roughly

1313
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:50,639
say the higher the temperature the more

1314
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,280
Turin are going to volatize you're going

1315
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:55,480
to lose it right but the lower the

1316
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,559
temperature goes down I'm being told

1317
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:00,480
it's okay A lot of people are storing in

1318
00:55:57,559 --> 00:56:02,480
a wine fridge that's about 50 60 deges

1319
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,599
fahrenheit that's one of my preferred

1320
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,559
ways to store some people in

1321
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:10,400
refrigerators which is just above

1322
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:11,400
freezing right uh typically what 33 to

1323
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:16,838
maybe

1324
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:19,798
44° F any concerns in storing in a wine

1325
00:56:16,838 --> 00:56:22,358
fridge or a refrigerator no I I think

1326
00:56:19,798 --> 00:56:25,159
that's the best the best move um I would

1327
00:56:22,358 --> 00:56:27,038
just be very certain that the container

1328
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:30,399
seals properly you know whatever

1329
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:32,079
container you're in is is sealed um cuz

1330
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,559
even in a refrigerator even though it

1331
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:37,359
would be slower it still can dry out um

1332
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:40,880
if it's not maned properly so getting

1333
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:44,759
your drying down your curing and then

1334
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:48,240
holding um at the exact water activity

1335
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:50,880
you want in the lower temperature yeah I

1336
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:52,679
mean the the lower you can go the better

1337
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,559
um but I know some people they don't

1338
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:56,399
necessarily have a a full wine fridge

1339
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:58,280
just for their their curing which would

1340
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,798
be pretty cool do you have that I do

1341
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:03,280
yeah I was using the wine fridge before

1342
00:56:59,798 --> 00:57:05,639
the canol oh okay cool yeah because you

1343
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:08,359
know I live in Las Vegas and it's very

1344
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:11,598
hot here and natural room temperature

1345
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:13,598
it's I'm lucky to get 70° Fahrenheit

1346
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,798
room temperature normally it's 75

1347
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:18,039
sometimes 80° and I used to just store

1348
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:21,318
it in those conditions and within 3

1349
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:23,280
months Browning happening like those

1350
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:25,838
higher temperatures really degrade the

1351
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,760
product you know so uh once I switched

1352
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:30,038
over to storing in the wine fridge and

1353
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,079
yes I have them in sealed jars I also

1354
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:35,240
did in the Grove bags made sure the

1355
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:37,160
humidity was locked in at 60 to 62% but

1356
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:39,199
putting it in that lower temperature

1357
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:41,000
conserved them for a lot longer you know

1358
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:42,279
and I didn't have any Browning you know

1359
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,719
I could have it for a year and there's

1360
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:46,880
no Browning happening so yeah I was a

1361
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:48,480
big proponent of the wine fridge not for

1362
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,079
drying I want to be clear on that some

1363
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,639
people were trying drying in a wine

1364
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:55,280
fridge katrol now it's just for drying

1365
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:57,159
and curing I think one of the biggest

1366
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,240
benefits of the canol is the drying a

1367
00:57:57,159 --> 00:58:00,358
lot of people think oh well I'll just

1368
00:57:58,239 --> 00:58:02,159
buy a wine fridge it's like well go

1369
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:03,400
ahead and try to dry in a wine fridge

1370
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:05,000
it's you know you're not going to get a

1371
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,639
good result unless you do some sort of

1372
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,679
alteration to it anyways yeah I am a

1373
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:11,759
proponent of the wine fridge for storage

1374
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:13,399
in particular and just wanted to kind of

1375
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:16,559
pick your brain a little bit on storing

1376
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:18,240
at 60° versus in a refrigerator at 40°

1377
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,240
if there's any any big difference

1378
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:25,038
between those two I think like you said

1379
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:28,000
it's just the length of shelf stability

1380
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:31,559
um the colder you keep it the slower any

1381
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,559
of those degradation processes are and

1382
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:36,680
um the longer it lasts

1383
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:39,240
so yeah I think it all just matters of

1384
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:41,078
how pick you are with perfection and and

1385
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:42,358
wanting to keep it as green and and

1386
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:46,000
really Longevity if you know you're

1387
00:58:42,358 --> 00:58:47,798
going to smoke at all in in a month then

1388
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,798
maybe it's not

1389
00:58:47,798 --> 00:58:52,480
necessarily required to have your own

1390
00:58:49,798 --> 00:58:54,960
fridge for for that and it'll do just

1391
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:58,199
fine in the in a you know temp tempature

1392
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:00,280
control room um but yeah the the cooler

1393
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:02,558
I would say the longer is really the

1394
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:04,680
takeaway good to know couple more

1395
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:07,000
questions for you one of them in regards

1396
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:09,279
to any studies that have been done

1397
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,798
recently in the past year or two that

1398
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,559
have uh revealed some valuable

1399
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:15,199
information that you feel like would be

1400
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:17,880
valuable to the audience you know

1401
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:21,399
there's there's a couple studies out of

1402
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:25,400
ug that have I don't know if they've

1403
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:28,639
been published yet but it was a post

1404
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:33,400
Harvest study um and she was looking at

1405
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:36,118
Tarpin and um and hemp at different

1406
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,160
curing but you again going back to this

1407
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:40,760
this all

1408
00:59:37,159 --> 00:59:44,719
exploration um hers was very dirty with

1409
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:47,240
you know the barn hanging the the 6060

1410
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:49,798
method was the the best representation

1411
00:59:47,239 --> 00:59:52,078
and then she was looking at some of the

1412
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:55,358
Techni techniques she would do with uh

1413
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:58,079
tobacco so you know fire curing and and

1414
00:59:55,358 --> 01:00:00,159
those sorts of things so you know

1415
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:02,400
there's been some studies and some nice

1416
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:06,798
generalizations we're able to conclude

1417
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:11,039
from them but you know if you're looking

1418
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:13,079
for extremely high quality smokable flow

1419
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:16,160
at least I haven't seen it in the past

1420
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:18,119
couple of years um cuz again a lot of it

1421
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:20,199
has been on hemp with really the thought

1422
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:23,200
being outdoor hemp that you're drying

1423
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:27,159
fast for isolate production one exciting

1424
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:29,159
thing we've gun um and about to start

1425
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:30,679
phase one on which we could certainly

1426
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:34,000
use your help on getting the word out on

1427
01:00:30,679 --> 01:00:39,239
this so um are you familiar with miabi

1428
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:42,760
shields and um Riley um yes yep okay so

1429
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:44,519
they're they're both phds and uh

1430
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:46,480
basically PL plant chemistry they both

1431
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:50,318
have a little bit different specialty in

1432
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:53,880
each and so they now run the nonprofit

1433
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:55,679
nap the network of applied pharmac

1434
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:58,318
cognacy

1435
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:59,719
and so we've we've been friends for a

1436
01:00:58,318 --> 01:01:02,000
while and been trying to find a way to

1437
01:00:59,719 --> 01:01:06,439
work together and so we've now figured

1438
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:08,719
it out um we want to we want to do a

1439
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:10,798
large pro project that's called this

1440
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:13,558
we're calling it the science of smok

1441
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:15,719
ability um

1442
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:19,280
because basically everything from

1443
01:01:15,719 --> 01:01:22,959
flushing to the Joint being in your

1444
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:25,160
hands is what we're looking at um and

1445
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:28,679
really trying to put understand

1446
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:29,679
around what means or what represents a

1447
01:01:28,679 --> 01:01:33,358
smooth

1448
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:34,078
smoke what is it about the color of Ash

1449
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:35,598
that

1450
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,960
matters

1451
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:41,559
um there's been people say that certain

1452
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:44,119
smokes can make their tum tingly and go

1453
01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:45,280
Nom which I've never experienced that so

1454
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:49,240
that one's going to be a little hard

1455
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,920
harder to dig into but um some of these

1456
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:52,798
generalities that everybody expects you

1457
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:55,880
know I want my ash white I want it to be

1458
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:59,278
smooth I want it cure for 5 months you

1459
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:02,880
know we we really want to look at again

1460
01:01:59,278 --> 01:02:06,480
the the end point so consumer preference

1461
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:10,720
and back it up to be able to say what's

1462
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:12,679
doing what and so that's a lot to cover

1463
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:14,480
um and so we're breaking it into phases

1464
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:15,719
with phase one it's going to be pretty

1465
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,440
easy pretty

1466
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:23,118
straightforward you have flower it it's

1467
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:26,679
all ground to the same um Micron size

1468
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:30,000
it's all um packed to the same density

1469
01:02:26,679 --> 01:02:32,199
and it is all the same water

1470
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,559
content um excuse me it's not the same

1471
01:02:32,199 --> 01:02:36,199
water content you've got different water

1472
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,278
contents cuz we said all right well

1473
01:02:36,199 --> 01:02:43,159
that'll be the easiest is simply looking

1474
01:02:38,278 --> 01:02:45,318
at water content and so some with a a 04

1475
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:47,838
6 and 08 so you've got a high you've got

1476
01:02:45,318 --> 01:02:51,199
a low and you've got what everybody says

1477
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:54,199
is just right all right very easy to get

1478
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:58,318
joints at three different contents like

1479
01:02:54,199 --> 01:03:00,919
that that send those out to the public

1480
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:04,519
people that's interested in the in the

1481
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:06,599
study and have it double blinded and

1482
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:09,358
then the people say all right well this

1483
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:12,200
SM smells the best this tastes the best

1484
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:14,920
this smokes the best um you know we

1485
01:03:12,199 --> 01:03:17,639
we'll get super nitty-gritty into the uh

1486
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:19,680
the patient discovery which thankfully

1487
01:03:17,639 --> 01:03:21,920
they've got experience on cuz I'm

1488
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:23,759
usually just with the plant but they're

1489
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,480
really good at connecting the plant and

1490
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:29,559
the treatment with the person and and

1491
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:31,519
how how to gather data from uh from a

1492
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:34,400
person you know that's not something I

1493
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:36,440
have specialty and um so that's where we

1494
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:39,119
kind of all come together as a as a nice

1495
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:42,599
group ranging from you know growing all

1496
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:45,760
the way to to smoking so phase one water

1497
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:48,200
content we're going to have CBD joints

1498
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:51,039
and we'll be mailing them out and

1499
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:53,879
getting test results back and and see

1500
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,920
what's going on I mean the past 2 years

1501
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:59,599
I've done dug so hard into tobacco

1502
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,798
research it's it's been ridiculous but

1503
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:03,119
um you know if you think about

1504
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:05,079
cigarettes if you're smoker and you go

1505
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:06,680
to one State versus the other or if it's

1506
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:08,680
two years difference you're going to

1507
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:10,480
expect that cigarette to be exactly the

1508
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:12,838
same and you're going to be mad if it's

1509
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,760
not um and so there's science and

1510
01:04:12,838 --> 01:04:16,318
there's repetition and there's there's a

1511
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:19,319
lot that's going in to get that

1512
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:22,719
cigarette exact um and that's what we

1513
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:24,759
can do in cannabis you know we know we

1514
01:04:22,719 --> 01:04:26,318
know when good ones are good

1515
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:30,039
um and there's Growers that can produce

1516
01:04:26,318 --> 01:04:32,920
good ones consistently but can

1517
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:35,119
you how do you convert that to be able

1518
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:38,278
to show other Growers this is what's

1519
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:41,680
good um until you have data behind that

1520
01:04:38,278 --> 01:04:43,440
you can't so that is our goal is first

1521
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:45,838
start with water content and then we'll

1522
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:48,240
go on other things like uh certain

1523
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:50,078
elements that can accumulate that causes

1524
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:53,078
a bad smoke there's certain elements

1525
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:57,000
that can accumulate that um that will

1526
01:04:53,079 --> 01:05:00,599
cause the Ash to break off faster than

1527
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,159
others um so phase two will be um

1528
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:05,798
elements cuz in

1529
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:08,759
tobacco they go deep into you know even

1530
01:05:05,798 --> 01:05:11,159
the the government restricting certain

1531
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:12,680
applications of certain fertilizers in

1532
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:16,118
excess

1533
01:05:12,679 --> 01:05:18,798
because it will mess with the smoking

1534
01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:20,480
process super interesting I follow both

1535
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:22,079
