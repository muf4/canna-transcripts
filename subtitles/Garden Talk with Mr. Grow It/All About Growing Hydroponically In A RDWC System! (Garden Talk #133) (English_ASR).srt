we're going to talk all about

65
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,759

thank you to all the supporters out

77
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,199
there but before we get too deep into

78
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,679
the conversation of Hydroponics can you

79
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,878
tell us a little bit about yourself and

80
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,159
how you got into gardening sure so um my

81
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:56,598
name is Corey I run the channel inside

82
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:58,399
Hydro um I've been growing for probably

83
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:01,318
a little bit more than 8 years now

84
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,719
actually uh I started when and I was 18

85
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:06,039
so luckily Massachusetts was one of the

86
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:07,639
first legalized States and we kind of

87
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:09,679
knew that was coming for a little bit

88
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:12,759
beforehand so I did get started a little

89
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,959
bit early and when I started I actually

90
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:17,719
knew nothing I mean I had no experience

91
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,400
with any kind of plan at all but I am a

92
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:21,280
pretty fast learner I think I can pick

93
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,280
things up pretty quickly I like to

94
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,519
believe at least so I just did a lot of

95
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,199
research um I actually knew right away

96
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,319
that dwc was the way I wanted to go so

97
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,318
that's what I started with actually

98
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,560
and I just ran a bunch of single buckets

99
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,318
for the first couple of years I built

100
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,598
off of that little bit of knowledge or

101
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,560
experience that I was gaining every grow

102
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:42,719
and eventually I understood what I was

103
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,120
doing and since then I've just made

104
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,400
small tweaks that ultimately result in a

105
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,719
better run and I've actually been

106
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,480
growing on YouTube for 7even years now

107
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:53,479
across a few different channels

108
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:55,479
unfortunately this is the third one

109
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,119
hopefully the last one things are

110
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:00,000
starting to lighten up a little bit I

111
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,319
hope so I'm just crossing my fingers man

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,039
I hate the fact that YouTube does that

113
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:06,119
man they they take down channels I had a

114
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:09,679
channel taken down before as well as

115
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,799
75,000 subscribers wiped out and that

116
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,519
feeling of just having knowing that you

117
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,759
have to start over completely and

118
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,040
everything you've built over those years

119
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:20,280
is gone is just one of the worst

120
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,800
feelings and I don't wish that upon

121
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,478
anybody so sorry to hear that but I'm

122
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,720
glad to see that your new channel here

123
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,199
is being built up you've got uh coming

124
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,440
up on 40,000 subscribers 37,000

125
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,240
subscribers

126
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:34,519
that's not easy so congratulations on

127
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,439
your success so far you have some really

128
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:38,000
really great videos and everything

129
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:41,199
revolves around

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,600
rdwc can you tell us what does rdwc

131
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,160
stand for and can you explain the basic

132
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,240
concept behind this hydroponic system

133
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,680
sure so dwc stands for deep water

134
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,280
culture and then rdwc stands for

135
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,639
recirculating deep water culture uh

136
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:58,359
really the only difference between the

137
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,160
two is that in rdwc all of the buckets

138
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,919
are connected and using the same

139
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,240
nutrient solution which is recirculating

140
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:08,439
between each pot so basically in an rdwc

141
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,680
system if we say it's six plants you'll

142
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:12,800
have seven buckets six of them being

143
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,240
occupied by plants and then one being

144
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,918
your control bucket so all of the

145
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,800
buckets are connected with piping and

146
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:21,399
sharing the same nutrients and not only

147
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,720
is the water circulating through all of

148
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:26,519
the buckets but it's being air rated as

149
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,400
well and each plant has a net pot where

150
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,799
the plant sits and through that pot The

151
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,198
Roots grow down and are completely

152
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,879
submerged in the solution nice pretty

153
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,919
straightforward description there so

154
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:40,000
what are some of the pros and cons to

155
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:41,719
growing in an R dwc system uh I would

156
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,319
say I might be a little bit biased for

157
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,039
this question but right off the top the

158
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,240
first thing that comes to mind is rate

159
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:50,879
of growth for sure I mean these plants

160
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,199
grow extremely fast and big in a rdwc

161
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,959
system which can shave off weeks of veg

162
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,000
time which can also save you some money

163
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:00,638
also in rdwc you're generally going to

164
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,560
be using 50% less nutrients throughout

165
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,639
the run just because the roots are

166
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,360
sitting directly in the solution at all

167
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,400
time making it much easier for them to

168
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,439
absorb that means you can get away with

169
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:15,079
a lot lower ppms also being able to get

170
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:16,918
a zero PPM flush I know that's possible

171
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:19,000
in some other systems but that's really

172
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,879
important for me and then another Pro

173
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,439
would be maintenance I mean once you

174
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,199
have the system set up and running you

175
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:28,598
can just keep reusing it

176
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,720
indefinitely and some cons um would be

177
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:33,560
setup costs if you're not Frugal it can

178
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,360
get pretty expensive to buy an rdwc or

179
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,720
build an rdwc system and then like with

180
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,840
any Hydroponics you have moving Parts

181
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,160
which also always leaves room for

182
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:45,159
failure and I actually have my system

183
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,360
set up in a way that is kind of fail

184
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,000
prooof I like to believe at least for

185
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,160
the electrical components that are

186
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,879
involved okay and then kind of getting

187
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:57,639
deeper into how the system works one of

188
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:59,199
the main components of an rdwc system

189
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:00,639
and how do they work together to grow

190
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,439
the plant

191
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,319
uh so the main components would be first

192
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:06,038
your circulation pump and that's what

193
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,479
keeps the water circulating throughout

194
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:10,719
each bucket and ensures the solution is

195
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,878
always mixed and moving stagnant water

196
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,800
is never really a good thing and then

197
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,240
also your air pump which keeps the water

198
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,439
oxygenated and makes it livable

199
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,680
basically for your roots Our Roots need

200
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,439
enough oxygen for growth and that also

201
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,959
helps prevent root rot uh with those two

202
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:28,120
things you can pretty much make a system

203
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:30,439
out of anything any container pretty

204
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,160
much works as long as it's opaque and

205
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:35,120
all you really need after that is a net

206
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,840
pot and then you also have a a reservoir

207
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,519
then the tubing connects to a bucket and

208
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:43,478
typically in rdwc it's multiple buckets

209
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,878
and then within the buckets you have

210
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:47,000
what you talked about the pump and then

211
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,919
the the air stones and stuff like that

212
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,439
right yep each bucket has its own

213
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:52,560
AirStone and then you'll have one

214
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:54,719
circulation pump that sits inside the

215
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,079
control bucket and that's what you'll

216
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,240
have a return line so the water comes

217
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:00,959
from the control bucket goes through all

218
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,879
of the plant buckets and then it comes

219
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,719
back through the return line back to the

220
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,840
control bucket and that's how it makes

221
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,159
it circuit are you running the pump and

222
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:13,279
the airstones

223
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:15,598
247 yes all times 247 okay and then is

224
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,959
there any general recommendations for

225
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:21,000
how many airstones to put in each bucket

226
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:23,079
I I know there's some concerns about a

227
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,720
lack of variation right and we can get

228
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:27,758
into some of the problems with in

229
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,960
Solutions later on but one of them is

230
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,000
not having enough of that Iration so how

231
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:35,360
many stones do you typically put in each

232
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,879
container I generally I'll use one

233
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,800
AirStone per bucket I do use the larger

234
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:42,918
ones they're like a soda can type of

235
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:45,759
shape um but for a general rule of thumb

236
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:47,600
as long as your entire surface of water

237
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,240
is bubbling then you should be in a

238
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,519
pretty good spot good to know would you

239
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,480
happen to know like wattage that it

240
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,799
pulls from the wall the pump and their

241
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,959
stones and all that stuff I um I think

242
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:00,039
it's about one liter per gallon that you

243
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:02,078
want your pump to put out so the G if

244
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:05,120
the system's 50 gallons it needs to be

245
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:06,958
putting out at least 50 L per hour but

246
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,440
you can always go higher than that when

247
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,000
it comes to the air you can't really add

248
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,360
too much okay and then as far as power

249
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,480
consumption not really oh power

250
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,560
consumption I'm actually not sure the

251
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,000
wattage yeah I'm not really sure okay I

252
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:23,000
think they're decently low uh I want to

253
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,480
say around 50 Watts but I could be

254
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,120
mistaken there I know there's different

255
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,839
pump sizes talking about the pump that's

256
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,320
within the main part there was is in the

257
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,680
reservoir is where that main pump is I

258
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,399
personally put mine in the control

259
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,759
Reservoir just to prevent any leaks

260
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,879
because if something did go wrong if you

261
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:43,240
had the pump in the return line which is

262
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,919
somewhere else you can also put it then

263
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,959
there would be a chance of you know

264
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:49,199
things leaking onto the ground I choose

265
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,078
to not even have to worry about that so

266
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,120
I do Place mine inside the control

267
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:55,199
bucket so if anything did go wrong it's

268
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,120
just going to leak inside the system so

269
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,879
it's really not going to leak at all got

270
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,360
it that's good to know and I know you've

271
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,639
built your own system there and it can

272
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,959
be a lot cheaper to build your own

273
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:07,439
versus buy one of these pre-made ones

274
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:09,879
right so what's the average cost to

275
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,079
build your own system versus buying a

276
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:15,078
pre-made one

277
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:18,000
so my current system um I've been

278
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:21,719
growing in for about um almost 3 years

279
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,399
now and it was $600 to build the same

280
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,839
system from current culture will be

281
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,519
closer to like

282
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:29,079
$2,000 and granted they do have a few

283
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,240
more features and stuff like that but

284
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:34,120
it's nothing that you can't live without

285
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,200
wow huge huge price difference there

286
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,639
yeah looking at the current culture ones

287
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,680
I know it's a very popular brand and uh

288
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,200
man they've got some big systems there

289
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:46,599
$1,600 over $2,000 so yeah it can be

290
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,720
very costly there yeah those are really

291
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,159
nice though I will give them that let's

292
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,120
get a little bit deeper into the system

293
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,480
that you've built can you break it down

294
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,000
for us like what is the bucket size how

295
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,759
big is your Reservoir what size tubing

296
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,480
you're using so on and so forth sure so

297
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:05,319
my current system it's built with 8 Gall

298
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,240
Square buckets I have six plant buckets

299
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,639
and then one 8 gallon for the reservoir

300
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,519
and they're all connected with 2in PVC

301
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,720
piping so the one thing I will recommend

302
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,320
is using the current culture bulkheads

303
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,160
for your piping and connections from

304
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,399
bucket to bucket they have the best

305
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:23,120
bulkheads I've ever used and they are

306
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:25,679
pretty expensive that will probably be

307
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,600
the biggest cost of the entire build uh

308
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,519
also if you're going to plan on

309
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,040
flowering in the system I wouldn't go

310
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,039
anything less than 2 in for the piping

311
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:36,120
size to reduce the risk of any clogging

312
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:38,319
or anything like that how do you kind of

313
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,799
connect everything together like there's

314
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,278
there's like a solution that you kind of

315
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:45,958
wipe onto the PVC and then kind of slide

316
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:49,078
it in and it hardens is that pretty much

317
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:51,278
yeah you use um PVC comment cement um

318
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:54,078
it's like a glue for PVC that kind of

319
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,480
just bonds the stuff together okay any

320
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:56,719
particular brand or anything that you

321
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,480
recommend there are they all pretty much

322
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,278
the same it's kind of like um what you

323
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,278
would use like for house piping it's

324
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:03,799
it's the same idea so I really just get

325
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:05,600
whatever they have at Home Depot pretty

326
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:08,439
much anything will work as long as it's

327
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,040
made for PVC specifically okay and then

328
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,399
in your six buckets that are 8 gallon

329
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:17,240
each on top you mentioned net pot what's

330
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,120
the size of the net pod that's on top of

331
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,759
the buckets I have six 6 in net pods 6

332
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,839
inch okay yeah so it goes 6 Ines down

333
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:27,639
into the into the bucket and then what

334
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,240
do you put in the net pots um I use a

335
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:32,440
straight Hydra and mix and then but well

336
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,839
I'll plant my seeds inside rock wool and

337
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,240
then I'll put the rock wool in and I'll

338
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:39,279
cover that in Hydra and Clay Pebbles

339
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,639
what else could be used besides the clay

340
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:44,399
Pebbles some people choose to use like a

341
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,039
mixture of perlite and hydren um you can

342
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,000
use if you have a big enough Rockwell

343
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:51,078
Cube you can just go straight Rockell if

344
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,078
you did choose but um I find hydren just

345
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:55,599
on its own it works great for drainage

346
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:57,719
it has good air flow so I don't really

347
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,560
find feel a need to add anything else to

348
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,480
it and then at what point point of the

349
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:04,078
plant's life you put it in the r ddbc

350
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,639
system like you mentioned that you're

351
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,919
starting rock wall how long you let that

352
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,959
plant grow in the rock wall until you're

353
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:15,319
actually putting it into your system so

354
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,759
you can really put it in at any stage

355
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,440
but normally if I have um a set number

356
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,278
of plants and I know I'm going to be

357
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,760
using all of them I'll put them in the

358
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:25,320
rdwc as soon as possible as soon as they

359
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,759
have a tap route coming out of the rock

360
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,519
W um just so that they can get a like

361
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,039
acclimated to the system the Roots can

362
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,440
start growing through the net pot that

363
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,759
they're going to actually be in I mean

364
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,399
the earlier the better really okay and

365
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:39,078
then since the roots aren't actually

366
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,000
reaching the water at that point are you

367
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:42,799
doing some sort of top feeding until the

368
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,440
plant establish his roots in the

369
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:47,838
bucket yeah so I'll definitely top feed

370
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,160
for the first couple of weeks at least

371
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,120
until the first Roots hit the water I

372
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:55,120
like to even continue top feeding for um

373
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,360
a few weeks after that to ensure we have

374
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,799
a strong base of roots coming out of the

375
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,480
net pot that's really important and then

376
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:06,958
water level within the actual buckets

377
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,079
what do you aim for so uh in the in the

378
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,799
early stages I always recommend people

379
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:13,559
to keep their water level a little bit

380
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,958
below the net pot um that way you have a

381
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:18,278
nice safe space of moist air it's really

382
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:21,000
hard for any rot to form there um but

383
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:22,320
once you have a good root Zone forming

384
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,198
uh you really want to bring that water

385
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,360
level all the way up to the bottom of

386
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:28,120
that net pot just so that there's no

387
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,199
water that I mean there's no roots that

388
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,360
are exposed to Air and not intaking

389
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,639
nutrients what would happen in that case

390
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,159
like if somebody would have that water

391
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,879
level really low it's just less of the

392
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:41,480
root mass that can absorb and um help

393
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,399
the plant out since it's just sitting

394
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,639
out in the air it's not really doing

395
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,320
much now what if you have too much water

396
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,198
in there that you bring it the water's

397
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,560
really all the way into the net pots so

398
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:53,078
you definitely want to leave a little

399
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:55,119
bit of room so that the plant can

400
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:57,599
breathe you don't want it to be um

401
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,039
oversaturated where the rock W is you

402
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,399
want the rock W to actually be pretty

403
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:04,000
pretty dry and then um you don't want

404
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,159
there to be any moisture until that

405
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,159
water level under the net pot getting

406
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:11,399
into nutrients next what do you use for

407
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:14,399
nutrients and do you target a specific

408
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:17,320
EC or PPM for the different stages of

409
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,480
growth yeah so I do use I'll use I use

410
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,680
synthetic nutrients um I was running

411
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,079
flex for the past couple of years but

412
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,399
recently I've switched to drip hydro and

413
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:28,278
that's something new that I'm kind of

414
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:30,000
trying out um but my PPM will differ

415
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:32,958
from grow to grow just depending on

416
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,879
strain and how the plants are intaking

417
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,318
that's one of the nice things about rdwc

418
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:39,278
is you can see that pretty easily but

419
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:42,559
generally speaking for veg I'll start

420
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:45,439
around a.3 I'll work my way up to a 0.9

421
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:47,399
1.0 and then once we get into flower

422
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,920
I'll give them an initial boost uh to

423
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:53,198
around a 1.2 I'll work my way up to a

424
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:56,318
1.5 and then I begin tapering back down

425
00:15:53,198 --> 00:16:00,318
after week 5 to six eventually to a zero

426
00:15:56,318 --> 00:16:03,120
PPM flush got it and then do to the pH

427
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:05,599
as well if so what do you aim for uh

428
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,799
yeah so definitely I do monitor my pH I

429
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,879
think it's really crucial for anyone uh

430
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:12,919
to do the same generally I aim for a 5.8

431
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,838
I don't get super scientific about it

432
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:17,318
and change it depending on the growth

433
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,560
stage not that there's anything wrong

434
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:22,120
with that but I run a little bit lighter

435
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:24,799
approach I let my P I'll pH my mixes to

436
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,919
5.8 and then I'll let it ride until it's

437
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:30,078
a mid6 before I do adjust anything

438
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,799
ideally I'm aiming for the pH to stay

439
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,958
pretty steady throughout the week so I

440
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:36,039
don't have to adjust it at all and then

441
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,119
another thing to mention in regards to

442
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:40,198
water is the water temperature super

443
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:44,278
important when growing hydroponically

444
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:46,799
what water temperature do you aim for so

445
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:50,198
my water temper usually sits around 73

446
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:53,479
to 77 which really isn't necessarily in

447
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:55,679
the ideal range at all um but I do

448
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:59,039
choose to not run a chiller in my garden

449
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:01,278
so the um W attemps kind of mimic the

450
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,799
room temperatures a lot what would be

451
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,000
the ideal water temperature so ideally

452
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:09,000
you want the water temperature to be

453
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,240
around 68° cuz higher temps do lead to

454
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,439
less dissolved oxygen in the water and

455
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,959
that can lead to root rot pathogens

456
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,360
forming in your root Zone but as long as

457
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,880
you are running a beneficial bacteria

458
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:22,719
and the temperatures don't rise over 80

459
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,760
uh you're in a pretty good spot it's

460
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,838
good to know yeah it's one of the

461
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:29,519
concerns for me doing Hydroponics uh I'm

462
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:32,000
about to start for the first time uh and

463
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,440
I've got a dwc bucket but it's always

464
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,079
been the water temperature has been a

465
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,400
concern because I live in the desert and

466
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:39,960
it's naturally you know my water temp

467
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,480
could easily reach 80 you know if not in

468
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,960
the high 70s right so high 70s you're

469
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,120
saying is achievable as long as you're

470
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,000
treating the water you mentioned yes uh

471
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:53,199
high 70s is definitely achievable my

472
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,359
water is at 77 degrees um a lot more

473
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,319
than I would like it to be but with the

474
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,199
addition of the beneficial bacteria it

475
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:02,000
really does a great job of keeping

476
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,519
everything healthy so the temperature as

477
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,919
long as you're adding it every week um

478
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:08,798
the temperature it's it's not the end of

479
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,400
the world what is it that you're adding

480
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:14,079
in for Benny's oh the the beneficial

481
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,840
bacteria so I was running hydrog guard

482
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,839
um I'm recently switched to impello bio

483
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:20,038
they have uh something called continium

484
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,399
so that's something that we're trying

485
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:24,519
out recently now each week the nutrient

486
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,559
requirements are going to change also

487
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:29,480
it's a good general practice to clean

488
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:31,240
out the reservoir how often are you

489
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,120
changing out the reservoir and do you

490
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,400
have any cleaning tips so I do weekly

491
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:38,879
water changes uh throughout the entire

492
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,440
grow cycle for the most part sometimes

493
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,320
early on when the plants are really

494
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,038
young um I'll let them run in the same

495
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:47,279
res for 2 weeks but that's pretty much

496
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,038
Max the solution will start to degrade

497
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:51,639
so it's best to just keep everything

498
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:54,000
Fresh weekly uh generally I'm only

499
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,919
cleaning the system between runs I'll

500
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,079
use a descaler to get rid of any of the

501
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,440
salt buildup anything that may be stuck

502
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,158
in the piping but that can't be done

503
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,600
while we are growing because that will

504
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:07,320
kill the beneficial bacteria that we're

505
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:09,719
trying to keep alive understood going

506
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:12,240
back to the chiller for a minute I know

507
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,159
you don't run one but there's some folks

508
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,038
in the audience that are wondering what

509
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:18,720
is a chiller can you explain what a

510
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:21,319
chiller is and kind of everything else

511
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,759
about it like how much a chiller cost

512
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:24,519
how much it would actually lower the

513
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:27,640
temperature of the water and so on and

514
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:30,440
so forth so a water chill is basically

515
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,159
an AC for the water a piece of equipment

516
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,200
you can run your water through to get it

517
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:37,480
down to your desired temperature so if

518
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,200
you want it at 68° you could set that on

519
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:43,079
the chiller and um it would achieve that

520
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,240
um I I don't really have a reason as to

521
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:47,639
why I don't run a chiller anymore at

522
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,759
first it was just a cost thing because

523
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,520
they are um $3 to $400 they can be even

524
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:53,558
more

525
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,158
expensive um and I just wanted to keep

526
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:57,839
my electricity down as much as possible

527
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:59,799
um so that's pretty much why I don't run

528
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,839
one and I just now that I've been

529
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:04,279
successful for so long without one I

530
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:05,720
feel like I don't I don't even need it

531
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:07,558
got it yeah I know a lot of people have

532
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,839
been complaining about the power

533
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:11,960
consumption and being just so expensive

534
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,558
to run those things right and uh that

535
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,880
was another thing that kind of deterred

536
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:17,319
me from doing Hydroponics because I

537
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,840
thought that I would need a water

538
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:21,960
chiller and that additional expense

539
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:24,119
right now I'm just I don't really want

540
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,558
to spend the money on a water chiller

541
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:29,199
but learning what I learned today about

542
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:31,960
uh how I can potentially run a high

543
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,000
water temp in the high 7s for example

544
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,600
and just have the beneficial bacteria in

545
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,759
there that's probably a route that I'm

546
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:40,000
going to try out for sure I think that a

547
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,879
lot of that belief actually comes from

548
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,200
like with the HPS lighting that it just

549
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,919
threw off so much heat that it was

550
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,759
nearly impossible to keep the water

551
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,640
temperature in check like no matter what

552
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,558
you did but now that everyone's using

553
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,600
LEDs it's they're not putting off as

554
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:56,279
much heat and with the beneficial

555
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,719
bacteria it's definitely possible that

556
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:02,000
makes sense so you talked about the

557
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,000
different PPM or EC that you aim for for

558
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,759
the different stages of growth and you

559
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,720
also hinted towards the beginning of the

560
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:10,240
episode that you flush your plants

561
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,798
towards the end of the cycle how do you

562
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,759
go about doing that end of cycle flush

563
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:19,759
so uh I do flush all my runs for a

564
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:22,640
minimum of 3 days sometimes a week or

565
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:25,440
more in rdwc you really only need about

566
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,880
3 days of flush but uh I will try to

567
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,679
time my Harvest on the Tricom stages

568
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,480
more than anything so if the flush is a

569
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:34,240
little bit too early and the tricomes

570
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,798
aren't quite where I want them to be

571
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,159
I'll extend the flush for a few more

572
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:40,119
days but I don't like going over 7 days

573
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,799
because you can tell the plants really

574
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:44,959
start to suffer after that and really

575
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:48,119
the only important part of my flush is

576
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,640
that I'm using the zero PPM R water and

577
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:52,959
we're making sure to not only refill and

578
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,600
empty the system once but multiple times

579
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,120
to make sure we're getting every last

580
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:59,439
bit of anything out got it so there are

581
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:01,319
lots of problems that can occur in

582
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,759
recirculating deep articulture or any

583
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:05,399
really hydroponic system what are some

584
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,240
of those common problems that Growers

585
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,720
May encounter when either setting up or

586
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,319
growing in in our dwc system um so when

587
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,558
it comes to setting up the system one of

588
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:17,678
the biggest concerns is making sure you

589
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:20,319
have a circulation pump for the right

590
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,880
size um something that's too big will

591
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:25,079
actually result in you just overflowing

592
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,919
naturally so it's always good to test

593
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:29,558
that out make sure your water level is

594
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:30,960
even throughout on all the the buckets

595
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:32,278
also the other most important thing is

596
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,798
your air pump so you want to make sure

597
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:36,159
you have a big enough air pump that's

598
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:38,839
putting out um enough air so that your

599
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,240
roots zones don't suffocate and once you

600
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:43,639
have those two things down pretty much

601
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,038
um you're good to go awesome there's a

602
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,038
couple problems that I'm aware of that I

603
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:49,679
fig I'd fire off and see if you had any

604
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:52,200
solutions to it one of them would be the

605
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,320
struggle to have different cultivars in

606
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,159
the same system you got one nutrient mix

607
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,798
that's being fed to all different plants

608
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,440
and generally speaking different both of

609
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:02,798
ours are going to update nutrients

610
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,960
differently do you come across problems

611
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:07,000
where it's like some plants are

612
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,159
deficient while some plants are toxic or

613
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,278
or anything like that yeah actually that

614
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:13,760
is that's pretty common I really try to

615
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:16,440
run the same strain throughout the

616
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:20,038
entire system if I can I know that gets

617
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:23,038
a little bit boring sometimes um but I

618
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:25,038
have had instances where um I have one

619
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,679
strin that's just

620
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:30,158
completely um toxic it's getting way too

621
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,159
much but um if I have five other ones

622
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:36,120
that are doing well then I'm going to

623
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:39,120
worry about those um more than just the

624
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:42,599
the one that is off so I try to favor

625
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:44,158
the the masses I guess to uh make up for

626
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:45,879
that but really there's not much you can

627
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,200
do that's one of the downsides of

628
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,679
sharing you know the same solution for

629
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,558
all plants you're going to have to run

630
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,919
the same strain got it and you mentioned

631
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:56,599
same strain are you going to the point

632
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,840
where it's like same strain as in same

633
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:02,639
cut or same same strain as in like it

634
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:04,558
can be from seed just the same strain

635
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,038
yeah no from seed just the same strain

636
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,278
definitely it doesn't have to be the cut

637
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:10,000
I mean even the fenos are going to

638
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:11,960
differ a little bit but it's not it's

639
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,880
it's not like big enough to where you're

640
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,038
going to like notice a huge one's going

641
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,760
to be deficient where the other one

642
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:21,640
isn't you really won't have that problem

643
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:23,319
okay another problem that is pretty

644
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,799
common and we we already kind of touched

645
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:27,960
upon it which is maintaining the water

646
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,960
temp keeping that water temp lower now

647
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,558
chiller was one solution right but there

648
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,600
are some hacks out there right that you

649
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:36,319
could do like I know some people do the

650
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,599
um Frozen water bottles in order to kind

651
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,359
of lower the temp in the reservoir in

652
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:42,519
the system is there any other hacks like

653
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:46,759
that to lower the water temp that you

654
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:48,200
know of um the I guess um the really the

655
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:50,519
only thing that you can do that's going

656
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,558
to really control it is keeping your

657
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:55,278
room temperatures down so if you control

658
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:58,678
your room to 75° the water is going to

659
00:24:55,278 --> 00:25:00,558
be 73 to 77 and if you go down even low

660
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:04,360
say 70° you know you're going to be

661
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:06,200
pretty close to that ideal range um the

662
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:08,798
one thing I would say about adding the

663
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,519
ice things to the buckets is just be

664
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:13,278
careful that if that is a plant um if

665
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,278
that's a plant bucket and the ice is

666
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,558
actually touching the roots um that can

667
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,679
be a little bit dangerous so you can do

668
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:22,359
that in like your control res but I

669
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,320
wouldn't add um ice to like anything

670
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:26,678
that has a root Zone in it that makes

671
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:30,798
sense another problem that actually may

672
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:33,080
not be a big problem is algae so algae

673
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,440
can kind of show up particularly on you

674
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:37,359
might have seen on the clay Pebbles I

675
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,200
know rock wool it can show up people who

676
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,678
do only Rockwell grows have algae on

677
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,880
them often times actually on a side note

678
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:47,278
I need to get somebody on the podcast

679
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,240
who grows in Rockwell if anybody has any

680
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:52,278
suggestions put it down in the comment

681
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,558
section below here but uh LG do you

682
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:57,159
worry about that at all if so like what

683
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:59,398
do you do about it um actually I don't

684
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:01,200
so in the system you're not going to

685
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:03,000
really have much allergy because you

686
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,480
have the beneficial bacteria in there

687
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,278
it's not it's not going to really be

688
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,720
growing on the inside of the bucket the

689
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:10,359
one place you may get it is on top of

690
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,640
that rock wool and that would really

691
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:15,439
only happen is if you're um top feeding

692
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,399
and then it's staying damp on there for

693
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,840
a little bit too long but after those

694
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:21,839
first couple of weeks you really aren't

695
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:24,158
top feeding anyway so there's not much

696
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,278
um water getting up on top or even on

697
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,720
that hyraw at all so you're really not

698
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:29,880
going to have much of an algae problem

699
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,319
more at least you shouldn't another

700
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,480
common problem that people face

701
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:35,960
particularly when they're building their

702
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:38,399
own systems is leaks right so do you

703
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,440
have any kind of best practices for how

704
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:42,678
to handle leaks uh I mean do you

705
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,720
recommend that folks put together the

706
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:47,519
system and then kind of check for leaks

707
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,159
initially or do they check for leaks

708
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:52,558
frequently or how do you go about leaks

709
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,679
so that's why I actually mention that

710
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:54,918
thing about the current culture

711
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,880
bulkheads because that's going to give

712
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:59,120
you the best chance of not running into

713
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,240
a league so it's worth spending um a

714
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,079
little bit extra on those but yeah I

715
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,599
would definitely say once you have the

716
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:07,278
system built um fill it up with water

717
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:08,558
make sure that the pumps are running

718
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:10,798
evenly make sure you're not going to

719
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:13,319
overflow and most importantly make sure

720
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:15,720
that you are not leaking because um if

721
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:18,398
you start growing and you run a leak

722
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,839
it's going to be really really hard to

723
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:23,759
like um plug it or fill it from the

724
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,240
outside while there's water in the

725
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,240
system so um you can do stuff like that

726
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,278
but you're going to have to empty

727
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,558
everything out you know try to fix it

728
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:32,720
and then you're kind of just crossing

729
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:34,639
your fingers so it's best to make sure

730
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,360
that the system is solid everything is

731
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,520
perfect before you put plants in it I

732
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:42,519
wouldn't rush that part at all cuz there

733
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:45,440
is a lot of water that is potentially

734
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:47,919
can spill so good advice now talking

735
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,759
about equipment was wondering what PH

736
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:55,240
meter do you use uh what PH meter so I

737
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:58,640
use um the I actually just got a new

738
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:01,640
setup it's called um it's from pulse and

739
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,440
it's a ph and a PPM U monitor that is

740
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,799
always in my res and it connects to my

741
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,720
phone so that has actually made things

742
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:11,639
really really nice I can see like not

743
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,159
only what the ph and PPM is currently U

744
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,759
but what it's done like over however

745
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,200
long so it's really nice to see things

746
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:20,519
if they're steady see if things are

747
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,399
dropping that gives you a ton of

748
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:24,798
information that's awesome this also

749
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,558
show water temperature on there as well

750
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,278
yes it does it shows you the water

751
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:30,119
temperature and then I think eventually

752
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:32,159
they're even going to be adding um

753
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:34,000
something that's measuring the airation

754
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,080
in the water so that's going to be great

755
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,278
as well wow that's pretty cool yeah so

756
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:39,639
some really good advancements with pulse

757
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:41,880
I know they also have like moisture

758
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,440
meters that you can put in your soil and

759
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,840
yeah that's definitely a company that is

760
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,320
innovative yeah I've actually been

761
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:47,879
working with them for a few years and

762
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,720
they've been they've been great all the

763
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,080
way through so I really enjoy their

764
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,200
products so there are a lot of folks

765
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,240
that are beginners and they're just

766
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:00,200
starting out growing with Hydroponics

767
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:02,679
where it be a dwc system R dwc system

768
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,038
narrowing it down to R dwc that's your

769
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:06,880
bread and butter what advice do you have

770
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,398
for beginners who are really just

771
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,840
getting started using this system when

772
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:12,158
you start out you really have two

773
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:14,398
options I know I already told you guys

774
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,840
to run the beneficial bacteria but your

775
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:17,959
other option is going to be running a

776
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,119
sterile resz which I would definitely

777
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,399
recommend not doing uh it's going to be

778
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:24,000
a much tougher time to keep things

779
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:25,879
sterile whereas if you add the

780
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,440
beneficial bacteria it's kind of just a

781
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,919
set and forget as long as you keep

782
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,519
adding it we

783
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:33,200
um so that's something to Definitely

784
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:36,359
Maybe steer away from I I if you wanted

785
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,440
to I would say try it out later on but

786
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:41,000
uh it's it's pretty difficult to keep um

787
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:44,200
a sterile system and I know we are

788
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,558
narrowing it down to rdwc but I tend to

789
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,319
um recommend for people to do start out

790
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,119
with a single bucket that way you can

791
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:53,278
really focus on one plant you can get a

792
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:55,398
good understanding of dwc how everything

793
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:57,200
works and then expanding on that plant

794
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:59,359
count is really nothing more than what

795
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,038
you've already done got it makes sense

796
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:03,079
yeah some good tips there so we have

797
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:04,599
flown through this episode has been

798
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:07,119
super quick I don't have any more

799
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:09,480
questions for you and maybe it's because

800
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:11,278
I am kind of just getting started with

801
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,640
Hydroponics myself I've been growing

802
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:17,720
soil cocoa for the entire time I've been

803
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,120
growing since 2010 14 years now which is

804
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,200
hard to imagine and uh yeah I'm just

805
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:24,319
going to be getting into Hydroponics

806
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,038
here this year so I'm really excited for

807
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:28,960
that is there anything else we need to

808
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:31,720
know about our DW that we didn't cover

809
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,399
in this talk um no I think we did a

810
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:37,079
pretty good job of getting through just

811
