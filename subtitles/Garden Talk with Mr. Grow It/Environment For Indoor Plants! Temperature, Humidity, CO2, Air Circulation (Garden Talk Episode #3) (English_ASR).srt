1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,919
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,320
know me my name is chris

3
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,399
aka mr grudd and welcome to my talk

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,359
channel got another discussion video for

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,960
you today

6
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,719
for this one i brought in chris from

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,039
happy hydro we talk about

8
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:19,839
environment particularly indoor grow

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,640
environment

10
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,600
we talk about the temperature humidity

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,679
co2

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,199
and air circulation you all have made it

13
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,358
very clear that you want to see

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,720
more of these type of discussion videos

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,600
the video i did with pigeons

16
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,238
on plant training has over 105 000 views

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,399
right now

18
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,238
the video i did with rob from cl tv

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,600
talking about plant nutrients

20
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:43,039
that has over 175 000 views as of right

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,679
now so you all have made it clear that

22
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,558
you want to see

23
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,759
more of these discussion videos and uh

24
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,119
got one for you today

25
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,759
the audio on this video is actually

26
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,238
recorded onto one channel so chris's

27
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,198
voice

28
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:57,198
on it is slightly lower than mine in the

29
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,198
future i'll make sure to record on

30
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,320
two channels so that way the audio will

31
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:01,679
be better in the future

32
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,679
but still pretty good you can still

33
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,159
listen to it so don't click away just

34
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,959
yet

35
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,960
let's get into the video all right we're

36
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,519
here what's up chris how you doing

37
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,959
good man how are you good good ready to

38
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,560
talk about

39
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,478
awesome ready to talk about environment

40
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,200
or what let's do it

41
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,079
all right so we'll cover uh let's cover

42
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,118
temperature

43
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,438
humidity let's get into co2

44
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,560
and then air circulation so basically

45
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,879
covers everything

46
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,799
has to do with uh plant's environment

47
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,599
how's that sound

48
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,320
sounds great man um you're located on

49
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:39,039
the west coast i'm on the east coast

50
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,519
we're dealing with different natural

51
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,640
outside

52
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:45,599
environments which um affects you know

53
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,879
inside environments and also correct me

54
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,078
if i'm wrong

55
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,000
there's not people don't really have

56
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,759
basements on the west coast right

57
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,840
yeah i don't have a basement now it's

58
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,000
just yeah on the east coast you guys

59
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,680
almost every house has a basement right

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,040
yeah like every house in buffalo pretty

61
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,320
much has a basement and

62
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,920
it's really a good spot to grow in terms

63
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,199
of like trying to keep things private

64
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,680
maybe like from

65
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,280
family friends visitors you know it's a

66
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,479
it's a good way to keep things separated

67
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,159
but there's

68
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,599
when i say it's a good place to grow

69
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,639
it's not an

70
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:19,280
easy place to grow in terms of like

71
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,399
you know humidity temperature and

72
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,840
controlling things

73
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,080
so i take it you grow in basements

74
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,000
i've grown in basements in the past the

75
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,959
biggest issues that you have

76
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,680
is a lot of basements aren't completely

77
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,920
waterproof

78
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,519
or sealed you know you get like a

79
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,958
basement that has cracks in the walls

80
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,280
and stuff and you can easily find

81
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,039
yourself dealing with

82
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,800
mold mildew and just like things like

83
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:48,400
that that can really screw up and grow

84
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,080
it's not the optimal place to grow

85
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,840
but when you you know if you have a

86
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,440
two-bedroom house and

87
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,878
a roommate and there's nowhere to grow

88
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:58,079
and you got a basement it's like well

89
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,840
obviously we're gonna utilize that space

90
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,640
if possible so

91
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,000
we have to look out for cold concrete

92
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,199
floors you know it's

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,560
you don't want to just set your plants

94
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:07,598
on the cold concrete floors in a

95
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,640
basement

96
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:13,679
um and also

97
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,719
just in the summertime dealing with

98
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,719
humidity dealing with the extreme cold

99
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,318
in the winter

100
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,239
those are some of the challenges but it

101
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,039
is a common area that people do grow in

102
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,239
and i

103
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,959
i think that people could

104
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,239
get some value out of some tips on how

105
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,039
to grow down there if you're on the east

106
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,480
coast

107
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,079
absolutely absolutely so we could

108
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,719
definitely talk about that so let's

109
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,840
start off with

110
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,400
temperature so me living on the west

111
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,640
coast

112
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,158
i actually live in a very dry climate a

113
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,199
very hot climate i live in a desert

114
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:44,959
region

115
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,878
you're in a more humid climate since

116
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,000
you're on the east coast

117
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:52,479
you have bodies of water around you

118
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,680
it's a lot more humid it's a lot more

119
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,759
colder

120
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,280
so i think our discussion i'm pretty

121
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,878
excited to have you on here in

122
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,000
particular because you live in such an

123
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,598
opposite climate

124
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,239
that i do and so there are different

125
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,598
pieces of equipment that we use in order

126
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,080
to control temperature

127
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,959
humidity and so on and so forth so kind

128
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,879
of starting with temperature

129
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,798
so the ideal temperature that i usually

130
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:20,478
aim for when i'm growing my plants

131
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:23,599
is anywhere between um 70 degrees

132
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,879
and about 82 degrees fahrenheit roughly

133
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,560
that's kind of ideal

134
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,399
now how some people may be watching this

135
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,879
they have may have read my book and saw

136
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,638
it was slightly different than that

137
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,478
what's in my book is kind of a general

138
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,280
guideline for that i'm kind of narrowing

139
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:36,959
that down

140
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,959
to be a little bit more ideal leaf

141
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,758
surface temperature of 82 is what i've

142
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,079
heard to be

143
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,280
ideal so i kind of aim for that if that

144
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,800
means that the canopy temperature is a

145
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,279
little bit higher than that to achieve

146
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,439
that

147
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,478
leaf surface temperature of 82 that's

148
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,160
okay

149
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,079
now as far as how low it goes i had

150
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,479
mentioned 70. it's okay

151
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,719
you know if it goes into the 60s that's

152
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:59,680
fine i actually do like to drop my temp

153
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,400
in the 60s towards the end of flowering

154
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,560
that way

155
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,679
it tends to bring out some of the colors

156
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,959
in some of the phenotypes

157
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,079
that i've grown um so going down to the

158
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,638
60s

159
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,159
is is fine for me like the plant will

160
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,240
still grow just fine

161
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,160
in that range but having a swing greater

162
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,519
than um

163
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,520
you know 10 15 once you get to upwards

164
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,599
of a 20 degree swing between day and

165
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,639
night time temperatures that's when

166
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,240
you know you might want to cause for

167
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,000
alarm it might be stressing out the

168
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,079
plants too much

169
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,360
so i would um i would agree with you and

170
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,959
i think that i would do

171
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,400
pretty much the same thing but one thing

172
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,519
on the east coast that we have to look

173
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,679
out for is if

174
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,038
if we drop the temperature down to 60

175
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,319
degrees in

176
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,439
late bloom and we are not aware of our

177
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,719
humidity levels

178
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:50,079
and we have like high humidity

179
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,199
low temperatures um you know it's a

180
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:55,198
prime time opportunity for powdery

181
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,840
mildew to start growing in your plants

182
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,319
like

183
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,679
um i've dealt with it in the past having

184
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,479
like too cool

185
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,759
of a of a bloom at night with too high

186
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,918
of a humidity

187
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,038
um from you know growing in the summer

188
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,399
or growing in

189
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:12,959
a basement that doesn't have a knock

190
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,318
a basement that's not completely dry or

191
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,560
um or even growing in an

192
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,479
upstairs like bedroom or something that

193
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,000
you just can't

194
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,918
if you don't do a good job of keeping

195
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,199
your humidity uh

196
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:24,959
low you can definitely have issues with

197
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,280
powdery mildew with cool

198
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,638
uh temperatures in late bloom so i would

199
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:32,318
warn people watch out for that

200
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:36,000
and then um another thing i wanted to

201
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,720
well what percent is high rh do you

202
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,839
consider high

203
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,520
that you're at risk for powering mildew

204
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,000
i mean if you're in late bloom and

205
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,359
you're and you're over 60

206
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,160
humidity i think you're starting to

207
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,520
creep into dangerous um

208
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,360
territories i mean i'm sure it's

209
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,639
debatable um

210
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,120
yeah i agree with you on that one i've

211
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,079
had bud rot uh in late bloom yeah

212
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,240
big large dense buds higher humidity not

213
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,240
enough air circulation that that

214
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,319
is involved in this as well and with

215
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,720
pottery mildew and it happens

216
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,520
yeah and it's so depressing when it

217
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,440
happens

218
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,560
yeah yeah cause it's like you've just

219
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,639
spent three

220
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,680
months maybe four months doing all this

221
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,280
work and you're

222
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,959
you know about to trim or you're about

223
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,478
to be cutting down soon and you find

224
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,000
that powdery mildew and stuff and it's

225
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,439
like

226
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,598
oh man like what do we do do we

227
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,959
now we have to throw a lot of this out

228
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,759
like wow

229
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,638
um it's terrible but to rewind a little

230
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,280
bit you mentioned

231
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,079
the uh plant canopy and leaf temperature

232
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,839
surface

233
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,519
and one thing i wanted to mention is

234
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,439
that um

235
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,680
if you're using like a grow room monitor

236
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,160
such as like the pulse sensor or sensor

237
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,280
push or any really temperature it could

238
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,319
be like a 12

239
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:50,000
you know walmart uh temperature thing

240
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,560
with the probe or whatever

241
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,120
that probe you're going to want to have

242
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,800
in your

243
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,319
canopy the temperature at your canopy on

244
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,400
top of your canopy

245
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,598
could be different than the temperature

246
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,000
uh you know in the

247
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,199
in the side of your room or whatever so

248
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,399
i think it's important for you to know

249
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,319
that they want to take their temperature

250
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,359
levels at the canopy

251
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,639
where the plants are because it can be

252
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,080
different throughout the room

253
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,918
yeah i agree with that i know some

254
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,918
people have a room temperature

255
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,359
they also have that canopy temperature i

256
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:20,878
know some people actually put it down by

257
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,400
the soil so they can get kind of get an

258
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,879
idea of what the soil level temperature

259
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,159
is now

260
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,479
of course if you have that humidity

261
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,720
monitor just resting on top of your soil

262
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,079
it could kind of be inflated as far as

263
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,560
the humidity number

264
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,158
for example um you know if you have a

265
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,359
wet medium moist medium yeah

266
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,679
and that's not going to give you a real

267
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,959
accurate representation of what your

268
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,478
temperature is

269
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,918
in the soil right it's kind of like

270
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,120
above the soil but it kind of gives you

271
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,240
a general

272
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,399
um general idea of what uh you know your

273
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,278
temperature and humidity is at the soil

274
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,039
level so

275
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,039
yeah canopy level great call out is to

276
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,958
get measurements there for sure

277
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,719
um and then you know you mentioned bud

278
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,399
rot and and uh

279
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,240
you're cooling your temperatures down in

280
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,320
late bloom and stuff

281
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,600
a one thing that you can do or that

282
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,879
growers can do

283
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,519
to avoid that issue even if the humidity

284
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,679
does get

285
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,799
get high in the room is to have good air

286
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:12,000
circulation

287
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,799
so i know this was on your list of

288
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,799
things to talk about

289
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,399
when you have good air circulation it

290
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,759
makes it hard for

291
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,240
mold and mildew to grow so having

292
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,278
you know the leaves on your plants just

293
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,320
like

294
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:30,958
you know moving a little bit signifying

295
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,680
that there is good flow coming through

296
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,239
the canopy

297
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,278
is going to prevent um the possibility

298
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,080
of a lot of like

299
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,200
mold and mildew and butter out and stuff

300
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,959
like that

301
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,360
i do want to take a step back and talk

302
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,759
about temperature just a little bit more

303
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,159
so if the temperature is one thing that

304
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:52,319
i use to regulate the temperature

305
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:54,319
in my grow environment is an inline fan

306
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,399
i use the ac infiniti inline fan which i

307
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,440
know that you are

308
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,720
familiar with i use the t6 model

309
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,079
for my 4x4 grow tent and i have

310
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,000
for those of you who don't know about

311
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:06,719
the ac infinity fan there's a controller

312
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,159
on it

313
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,920
and this fan is is pretty advanced

314
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,480
compared to other fans you can actually

315
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,039
have set points on it as a probe and set

316
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
points

317
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,559
so you can actually hang that probe and

318
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,120
canopy level and you can have the set

319
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,239
points

320
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,639
for certain temperature and humidity so

321
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,639
what i have it set for is the

322
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,559
temperature at 82

323
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,319
so once the temperature actually goes up

324
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:31,119
and reaches 82

325
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,480
it will my ac infinity fan will turn on

326
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,320
and it will start to exhaust

327
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,399
some of that hot air and then of course

328
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,760
my lung room or the room that

329
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,919
my grow tent is in has

330
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,278
air that is around room temperature it's

331
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:46,479
usually around 70

332
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:48,720
72 degrees so that air is coming into

333
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,800
the grow temp passive intake

334
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,000
and then again once that hot air is

335
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,359
being exhausted the fan will

336
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,159
automatically

337
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,120
turn off so it's intermittently coming

338
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,480
on

339
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,759
controlling and kind of keeping that

340
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,839
temperature around 80 82 degrees

341
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,879
when the lights are on now when the

342
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,320
temperature is

343
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:10,320
too low so say it goes down

344
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,600
below my ideal temperature like i

345
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,519
mentioned

346
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,040
you know 70 roughly if it goes into the

347
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,839
60s that's okay but

348
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,039
i have a heater in my lung room so lung

349
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,160
room the room that

350
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:23,599
my grow tent is in i have a heater so i

351
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,120
try to stabilize

352
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,000
the temperature at around 70 degrees 72

353
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,440
degrees

354
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,200
for example now on my heater there is a

355
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,120
feature on there which is going to you

356
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,680
can put that you can set the temperature

357
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,159
so if the temperature drops below that

358
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,000
set point it's going to kick on

359
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,679
so my lung room is stable at all time

360
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,440
due to the heater

361
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:50,000
and then as my grow light is on and it's

362
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,880
exhausting with that hot air that stable

363
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,039
um

364
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,399
air coming in about 70 degrees is coming

365
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,799
into my grow tent so

366
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,919
my fan is coming off and on so that's

367
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,278
how i

368
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:02,879
regulate temperature in my grow space

369
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:05,360
and then one other thing to mention was

370
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,919
the sensor push

371
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,039
sensor push pulse those are monitors

372
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,319
that you can use

373
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,838
within your growth space i personally

374
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,560
use the sensorpush one i actually just

375
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,639
got

376
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,838
the pulse one thanks to you i haven't

377
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,000
used it yet though

378
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,000
but but um

379
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,078
having that canopy level as well and

380
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,679
getting alerts through your smartphone

381
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:27,199
because there's an app that you connect

382
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,278
and tells you what the temperature is

383
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,399
what the humidity is you can just see it

384
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:31,759
on your app you don't actually have to

385
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,559
go into your grow room

386
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,958
um so using those pieces of automation

387
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,359
uh

388
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,679
what do you mean records like it records

389
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,360
the data over time so you can go back

390
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,879
and you can look at your graphs and be

391
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,680
like oh on

392
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,240
i notice that every november this

393
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,679
happens

394
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,278
you know what i mean on the graph it

395
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,719
gets too cold in my room so i know i

396
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,039
need to have a heater in november like

397
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,800
you can go back and analyze the data

398
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,000
or like i know that like i'm noticing

399
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,319
that in the middle of the night it gets

400
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,519
too cold or it gets too hot in the day

401
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,160
or you know whatever

402
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,078
exactly exactly you can analyze yep and

403
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,559
you can also do the set points as well

404
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,319
on sensor push where you get

405
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,159
notifications on your phone right so if

406
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,000
the temperature drops yeah so the

407
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,679
temperature drops too low

408
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,120
i'll get alert then i can go into my

409
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,399
room figure out hey why is this

410
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,839
heater's not working do i need to

411
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,399
increase the temperature so on and so

412
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,200
forth

413
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,679
or if it gets too high right maybe maybe

414
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,800
uh

415
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,039
you know something went wrong to where

416
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:28,159
my lung room the temperature is too high

417
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:30,000
um so the air coming into the grow tent

418
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,600
is too high so that i need to make

419
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,720
adjustments maybe add an air conditioner

420
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,440
for example

421
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,519
so how does it work with you you're

422
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,880
you're talking about this um

423
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,879
the sensor pushing how it can give you

424
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,120
alarms to your phone this

425
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,198
technology of like those types of alarms

426
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,198
greenhouses have been using for

427
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:51,838
forever um so my wife her grandfather

428
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,278
owns or owned a greenhouse he's passed

429
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,720
away and the business was

430
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:59,039
closed but um in his greenhouse

431
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,920
they had alarms so it didn't go to your

432
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,958
smartphone

433
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,599
they had a wire ran so there was an

434
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,919
alarm

435
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,360
in their bedroom in the house like in

436
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:11,838
front of the greenhouse

437
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,278
so if it was too cold or too hot um

438
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,320
you know the alarm would go off at three

439
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:15,600
in the morning and they'd have to wake

440
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,000
up wake up and go out there you know

441
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,480
they've got

442
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,919
a ten thousand dollar crop they gotta uh

443
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,240
make sure it doesn't die

444
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,039
so i just think it's funny how the

445
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,919
technology

446
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:28,159
is still kind of the same but like now

447
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:31,439
it's like oh right on my phone like

448
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:35,039
i don't have to have an alarm like

449
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,120
in my bedroom yeah so

450
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,599
when the temperature reaches too low i'm

451
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,399
using a heater you know my lung room

452
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,079
temperature's too high i have actually

453
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,440
have a central air conditioning is what

454
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,759
i've used i've used those

455
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,720
portable air conditioners before very

456
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,559
inefficient

457
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,560
didn't have good luck i mean temperature

458
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,799
was super stable don't get me wrong but

459
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,879
as far as energy consumption it was

460
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,198
super expensive

461
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,879
so i i've avoided using that i use my

462
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,879
central ac now

463
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,000
that's just in my area like i mentioned

464
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:05,519
my climate that i live in

465
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,120
i live in the desert region so i'm able

466
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,560
to kind of get away with that what do

467
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,078
you do do you do you have to run a

468
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,198
heater and you have to

469
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:15,439
run any sort of air conditioning too

470
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:16,240
so um on the east coast if you're if

471
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,720
you're growing

472
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,839
in like your house where you have you

473
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,120
know central air

474
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,560
or um heat it's going to be very similar

475
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,639
to what you're dealing with it's not

476
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,119
going to be a whole lot different

477
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,159
um but you know if you're growing in a

478
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,278
space where you don't

479
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:36,480
have like for example a friend of mine

480
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:39,519
is growing in his basement and

481
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,440
um what he does in the wintertime

482
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,799
is he runs a couple of the growers

483
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,360
choice 500 watt

484
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:50,000
cmh lights instead of running led lights

485
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,800
because he actually uses the heat from

486
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,839
the lights to keep the grow space warm

487
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:58,479
and then when they shut off he's got um

488
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,600
you know a heater down there and i i

489
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,800
think he actually

490
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,440
uh vented his like heater for his house

491
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,319
to like

492
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,560
be able to uh produce heat into the

493
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,680
basement grow room as well but um

494
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,319
yeah that's something that people in

495
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,638
cold environments can do you know leds

496
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,639
are

497
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,360
efficient and they save on heat but if

498
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,759
you need heat use an hps or a cmh

499
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,959
yep yeah it's going to generate a lot

500
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,480
more heat and

501
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,559
heat up your grow space i know growers

502
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,639
who that's what they run in

503
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,758
the winter time is hps so they can warm

504
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,799
up their grow space

505
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,199
and in the summer time they go to led

506
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,240
yep yep that's um it's pretty common on

507
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:35,838
the east coast

508
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,680
at least uh for the people i know and

509
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,680
the growers that i've met in the local

510
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,078
grow shops and stuff when i worked there

511
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,638
let's talk about humidity shift gears

512
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,399
over to humidity so humidity

513
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,919
uh you know there's a lot to be said

514
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,679
about humidity

515
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,958
what the ideal range is i know a lot of

516
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:54,879
people go again go

517
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:56,319
for vpd a vpd vapor pressure deficit

518
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,159
we won't get into too much detail about

519
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,120
what that is feel free to google if you

520
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:03,278
want to learn more but basically

521
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,400
your humidity level goes by the

522
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:05,919
temperature

523
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,439
leaf surface temperature to be more

524
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,199
exact some people just use the the

525
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,439
temperature in the grow room to kind of

526
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,360
chase after vpd but it does call for

527
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,439
higher higher humidity than

528
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,879
normal right and you do come across

529
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:21,038
risks for things such as bud rot

530
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,199
uh pottery mildew mold things like that

531
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:23,759
for uh what calls for higher humidity

532
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,120
than normal

533
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,640
vpd oh okay yeah yeah

534
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,399
yeah so if you're running like 80

535
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,360
degrees i mean we can bring up the chart

536
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,759
right now

537
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,279
let me see if i can summarize vpd for

538
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,160
for those who might not know

539
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:40,160
basically like your plant is going to

540
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,440
release

541
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:47,679
moisture from its leaves

542
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:50,320
based on how humid it is in the room

543
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,280
yeah transpiration yep okay so it

544
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,079
transpires

545
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:56,399
it releases humidity transplant out of

546
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,960
the leaves into the room and if the room

547
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,600
is very humid it will transpire at a

548
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,319
lower rate if the room is really dry

549
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,839
it's going to transpire at a faster rate

550
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,839
which is going to affect

551
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:10,240
how often you have to water the plant

552
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,720
and the the health of the plant and how

553
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,400
it's

554
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,759
producing cells and um growing

555
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,440
yeah i mean that's one thing i run into

556
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,400
is a very low humidity uh

557
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,000
transpiration increases if i'm running

558
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,440
synthetic nutrients for example bottle

559
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,200
nutrients of feeding the plant

560
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,960
it could run into very very very well

561
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,400
run into a toxicity issue

562
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,640
it's happened before to where you have

563
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,038
too much yeah because your plants drying

564
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,960
out

565
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,480
uh the medium a lot quicker it's up

566
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,600
taking nutrients quicker there's a plant

567
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,360
available nutrients

568
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,719
you can't run into toxicity issues with

569
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,279
low humidity so

570
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,720
kind of bringing up that humidity but

571
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,240
getting back to the vpd

572
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,839
i'm looking at the chart right now so

573
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,880
for example if you're running

574
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,959
a temperature of 84 degrees

575
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,640
it's calling in the green area for about

576
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,840
70

577
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,759
74 to 78

578
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:59,119
humidity so let's just give you an idea

579
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,480
that's you know some people hearing them

580
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,079
like oh wait that's

581
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,000
that's way higher than what i'm running

582
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,359
right now some people might

583
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,079
hear that number and they might be like

584
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,319
oh i hear pottery mildew

585
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,079
pottery mildew knocking at the door you

586
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,079
know so um

587
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,359
it's risky i think chasing after vpd i

588
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,199
think is definitely risky

589
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,439
the general range that i usually aim for

590
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,600
is between 40 and 60 percent

591
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,880
um so i can avoid pottery mildew you

592
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,759
know bud rot when it comes into

593
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,240
flowering

594
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,798
so on and so forth what um what percent

595
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,038
humidity do you usually aim for

596
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,200
well let's um i'd like to just talk

597
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:36,160
about early veg for a minute

598
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,440
um well seedling clone and early veg

599
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,360
because i feel like

600
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,880
that is a point in time where humidity

601
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:44,240
is extremely important

602
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,679
and um a lot of people have

603
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,120
issues with their plants during these

604
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,960
periods that they think are due to ph

605
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,399
nitrogen toxicity or not enough

606
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,160
nutrients

607
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,759
whatever like it's hard to sometimes

608
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,038
pinpoint if you're not tracking your

609
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,960
humidity well

610
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:02,558
uh the the general consensus really is

611
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,079
that you have to have

612
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:07,599
high humidity in early veg and for your

613
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:10,480
seedlings and clones

614
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:12,000
or they just they they don't grow well

615
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,440
yeah you bring up a great point i should

616
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,599
have said that

617
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,519
it's crazy the difference that it makes

618
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,558
like i've i've seen

619
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:23,679
a girl maybe i was even involved in it

620
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:25,759
that had you know just

621
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,720
vegging plants that just look like

622
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,279
and you're like

623
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,880
why is this happening like what do we do

624
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,240
we you know we go through the list we

625
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,159
try to narrow it down

626
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,279
you know what let's introduce a ton of

627
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,039
humanity uh

628
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,678
to the room and get it up to you know 70

629
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:41,200
percent three days later all of the

630
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,880
plants are just

631
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,240
i call it praying for light when the

632
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,600
leaves are just like

633
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,720
they just look so happy like um

634
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,839
so i think like early veg one of the

635
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,919
biggest problems that people

636
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,918
have that they overlook or don't put

637
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,000
enough kind of like

638
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,440
uh effort or whatever into is is

639
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,720
figuring out or is getting their

640
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,200
humidity up so

641
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,880
uh one thing i saw which is really cool

642
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,360
from seed to stone

643
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,400
he has these little plastic domes that

644
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,479
he puts

645
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,320
oh so he transplants his seedlings or

646
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,000
his clones into

647
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,439
the pot and then he has these like

648
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,440
plastic domes that he puts

649
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,400
over them which acts as like a little

650
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,440
humidity it only keeps the humidity up

651
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:27,038
as the plant transitions into its new

652
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,240
vegetative state and uh new pot

653
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,400
and i've seen you do it with like

654
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,640
plastic bags plastic bags over the cups

655
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,798
yeah that helps with seedlings for sure

656
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,799
which is cool too yeah but one of the

657
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:38,480
biggest changes that i made like as an

658
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,038
early grower was introducing more

659
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,839
humidity and a veg and just

660
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,200
it's just it's a it's a big um big

661
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:47,119
difference

662
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,640
yeah you bring up a great point i should

663
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:49,918
have said it earlier when i mentioned

664
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,240
that the 40 to 60

665
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,679
the 40 60 40 to 60 that i mentioned

666
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,319
earlier is really for

667
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,240
for veg and flower those are safe routes

668
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:02,000
now when you're in seedlings

669
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:05,279
clones um i run higher than 60

670
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,079
i aim for like 65 to 85 percent

671
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:10,720
is typically what i aim for on that

672
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:13,439
avenue and then when they're in veg

673
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,000
you know mid veg is when uh you know i

674
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,240
get below

675
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,679
60 and that goes against vpd you know

676
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,359
some people are going to say that this

677
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,360
isn't ideal and we're just kind of

678
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,798
talking general range that the plant

679
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,319
will grow in here

680
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,558
um so i think that's the kind of a

681
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:29,200
general range so like i mentioned before

682
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:32,240
i live in a very dry climate

683
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,279
so i have to actually run a humidifier

684
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,798
at all times 24 7. two humidifiers

685
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:37,759
actually have two humidifiers in my lung

686
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,079
realm

687
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,759
in my veg 10 i have a humidifier too and

688
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,798
my flower 10 i don't need to

689
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:47,519
run a humidifier most of the time

690
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,119
we also run we also run a humidifier in

691
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,720
a vegetation in this climate

692
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,399
oh you do without jerry in this diamond

693
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,519
yeah okay i've heard a lot of most of

694
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,038
the time

695
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:56,558
i've heard a lot of people i know my

696
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:57,919
friend lives in boston

697
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:00,158
and uh he's i mean he's right on the

698
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,559
water so humidity is just naturally high

699
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,440
i mean

700
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,960
sixty percent plus uh it's just

701
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,840
naturally i know in florida too

702
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,798
it's crazy so people have to run a

703
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,839
dehumidifier all the time

704
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:14,158
or else powdery mildew

705
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,599
you're both on deck just in case just in

706
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,480
case because you know the

707
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,918
with the season's changing i mean winter

708
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,400
you know if you have forced air in your

709
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,159
house

710
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,080
in the in the wintertime it's getting

711
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,679
dry and the winter just gets drier in

712
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:28,079
general over here

713
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,038
it's honestly a pain in the ass because

714
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,480
if you're not

715
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,558
really caught if you're not paying

716
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,558
attention to the seasons

717
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,000
especially if you're a new grower like

718
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,720
you know you go you have this

719
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,400
amazing grow because you did it in the

720
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,759
perfect time of season and then you go

721
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,720
to do your next girl

722
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,640
and you're like you know why why what's

723
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,400
happening why why aren't things healthy

724
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,000
the seasons change and the humidity is

725
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,080
different so we keep both to keep the

726
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,079
humidifier on deck and the dehumidifier

727
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,599
i mean just try to

728
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,199
really pay attention to the season

729
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:59,599
changes

730
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,120
so you have them on at all times in the

731
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,119
room even if you don't need it or do you

732
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,959
only bust out the dehumidifier like on

733
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:08,558
certain seasons

734
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:12,000
we bust out the dehumidifier for usually

735
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:14,798
uh mid to late veg and then

736
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,400
into the drying phase like we don't we

737
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:17,599
don't crank it during the drying phase

738
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,240
because if you dry

739
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:22,639
your stuff too fast it's just not good

740
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,278
it'll smell like hay and

741
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,240
not good so we don't crank it but we run

742
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,839
it

743
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,759
in the summer we usually don't run it in

744
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:33,439
the veg we usually don't have to at all

745
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,599
even in like mid-late veg

746
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,240
um yeah we run in the summer in the

747
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,558
winter we just run it basically in late

748
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,278
late late bloom uh and in the drying

749
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,079
phase

750
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,278
uh the humidifier we run in the winter

751
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:48,480
we're running it in veg

752
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:51,278
actually mostly year round

753
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,759
um like i said i just find that the veg

754
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,960
up

755
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:58,400
like the veg plants grow so much faster

756
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,400
with good humidity so

757
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,679
we don't really use the humidifier in

758
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,000
bloom

759
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,200
ever i don't think yeah i don't really

760
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,839
think we do

761
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,960
and if if we do it's only for like the

762
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,519
beginning for

763
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,200
you know a little wild first couple

764
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,119
weeks or something

765
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,880
but yeah that's a good example of how

766
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:17,359
it's comp it's different for me like i'd

767
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,400
never

768
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,639
run a dehumidifier need to winter time

769
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,440
like you mentioned the heat forced hot

770
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,759
air

771
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,200
you know i have a gas forced hot air

772
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:31,200
heating system

773
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:34,480
it does lower that humidity actually

774
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:38,080
it was 18 the other day 18

775
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,839
that's crazy crazy low so i'm constantly

776
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,759
battling that low humidity and that's

777
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,199
why i have to run multiple humidifiers

778
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:44,960
in the climate i live in and it's just a

779
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,400
perfect example how two different

780
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,278
climates two different setups you just

781
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,360
gotta

782
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:50,480
you know uh figure it out there's so

783
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,000
much balancing

784
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,000
i get so many growers asking me

785
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,599
questions about what they need to do

786
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,038
and they live in a different climate so

787
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,798
it's like uh they

788
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:01,200
it's like different than what i would do

789
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,879
and so it's just a matter of uh

790
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,319
tinkering with your equipment and

791
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,159
figuring it out i think

792
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:07,839
i think this is a good segue into

793
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,880
discussing co2

794
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,879
yeah oh yeah yeah um using co2

795
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,559
the most ideal way and efficient way to

796
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,679
do it is in a sealed room right because

797
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:17,599
if you're not

798
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,120
if you're just exhausting all your co2

799
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:20,399
out the window

800
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,479
it's you know what i mean you're gonna

801
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,400
go through tons of tanks or

802
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,558
you know propane if you're using a co2

803
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:30,159
burner or

804
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:33,678
it's just not extremely effective to

805
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:36,799
run co2 and then just like exhaust

806
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:40,798
outside so the long room

807
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:43,918
is a fantastic way to uh to have like a

808
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,400
a good co2 system where you know the co2

809
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,480
gets

810
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,240
goes into the grow tent and then it gets

811
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,839
pumped out into the lung room

812
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,000
you know that lung room is going to have

813
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,678
a higher co2 content like the

814
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,038
the co2 is going to stay in there that

815
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,120
the plant isn't

816
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:59,519
the plants aren't consuming um it's

817
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:02,079
going to sink to the floor

818
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,720
because it's heavier than air and the

819
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,558
passive

820
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,240
intake on your grow tent i assume is at

821
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,319
the bottom

822
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,759
so the co2 is just going to get sucked

823
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,798
you know back into the tent

824
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:13,519
naturally and uh kind of just keep going

825
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,119
into the tent

826
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:18,079
into the long run into the tent in the

827
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:20,158
long run and um

828
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:22,558
and you're so you're using tmb naturals

829
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,679
um co2 canisters correct

830
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,240
yes and you you shake those up like once

831
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,159
a day

832
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,759
and they um do you do you like hang it

833
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,480
above your plants or do you just set it

834
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:32,720
on the ground

835
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,640
so guidance from tmb naturals we you can

836
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,480
do a couple things

837
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,640
number one is you can hang it above your

838
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,519
plants because co2 is a heavy gas it's

839
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,480
going to sink down so your co2 will sink

840
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,319
down there

841
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,919
or if you have an oscillating fan within

842
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:47,599
your environment they had mentioned it's

843
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,720
fine to place it like

844
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:52,000
around that either in front of the

845
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,159
oscillating fan or behind the

846
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,880
oscillating fan so that way

847
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,240
it's blowing the co2 around i've just

848
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,840
been putting it on the ground i've hung

849
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,000
it above my plants before

850
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,599
i actually think my co2 tank is uh the

851
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,640
canister is actually oh right now i need

852
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,678
to refill it

853
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,679
um i haven't been monitoring the co2 uh

854
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,679
recently i have gone grows where i've

855
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,440
monitored the co2 very closely

856
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,278
with those tnb naturals it kind of

857
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,320
varies especially since i'm living in

858
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,440
the house

859
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:21,918
that i grow in human respiration

860
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,519
my i'm exhaling co2 i have a roommate i

861
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,360
have pets

862
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,079
that is actually sufficient so when i go

863
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:31,678
in my room my lung room alone

864
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:34,639
it's like 600 800 ppm of co2

865
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,278
and when i'm out yeah without the

866
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,200
without

867
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:38,480
tmp naturals now with them when i got

868
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,798
tme naturals in there

869
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,159
plus my human respiration i'm up over a

870
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:46,240
thousand oftentimes

871
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:48,480
a thousand 1200 i know a lot of growers

872
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,319
uh ideally they had mentioned a thousand

873
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,120
to fifteen hundred when you're using

874
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:53,038
like a co2

875
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:54,158
tank for example which i know you have

876
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:55,679
experience on

877
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,240
and there's a regulator and so on and so

878
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,360
forth is that typically what you aim for

879
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,120
or what do you what do you

880
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:02,959
aim for when it comes to co2 and how do

881
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,798
you manage it i think

882
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,480
i think if people are are using

883
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,000
supplemental co2 they're they're

884
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,839
you know ideally trying to hit a

885
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,440
thousand twelve hundred at the very

886
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:12,959
least

887
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,798
before i get into the tanks so i wanted

888
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,440
to ask you is there a specific reason

889
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:20,240
that you decided to go with the co2

890
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,440
canisters from tmb rather than like the

891
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,798
mushroom bags

892
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,840
or tanks or

893
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:28,480
um they sent it or whatever sent them to

894
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:31,599
me for free

895
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,200
try it out that's a that's a good answer

896
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:35,278
that's that's the reason why yeah

897
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,240
i've seen those bags and those bags i've

898
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:37,119
heard a lot of people say they're much

899
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,120
more effective

900
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,558
there's some i think last with 365 days

901
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:44,639
or something like that i think

902
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:46,000
the exhale bags but i haven't used those

903
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,440
so we use this i used to sell them in

904
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,720
the grow store i worked at here we don't

905
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,640
sell them on happy hydro

906
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,278
yet but um you know we had one set up in

907
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,840
the store

908
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:58,159
and we and we had a monitor on it and it

909
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,359
kept the tent you know 900 to a thousand

910
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,600
and i'm pretty sure as

911
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:03,038
long as the the mushrooms are or the

912
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,480
mycelium is growing

913
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:07,519
as long as it's growing it's producing

914
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,880
co2 constantly so basically i

915
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:10,879
you know someone can correct me in the

916
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,679
comments if i'm wrong but as long as

917
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,200
that bag

918
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,000
is is alive and producing more co2 and

919
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,640
growing

920
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,839
it can last as long as you keep it alive

921
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,600
but

922
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:23,519
they are you know it is introducing

923
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:25,038
another living thing into your room

924
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:26,639
that you kind of have to keep an eye on

925
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:28,319
it

926
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,399
and kind of keep alive i mean if you

927
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,398
just throw that mushroom bag

928
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:34,319
two feet away from a thousand watt hps

929
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:34,959
light or something i'm pretty sure that

930
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:37,038
light will

931
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,120
dry it out or kill it or and there are

932
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:40,000
cheaper methods to the bags and the

933
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,879
canisters

934
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,558
uh there's actually home remedy methods

935
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,720
it seems like every time

936
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:49,200
every time i release a video where i

937
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,000
show the tma naturals or talk about co2

938
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,440
in some sense

939
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,200
there's always somebody in the comment

940
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,600
section who lists off

941
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,960
a super cheap way to do their own co2

942
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:57,278
and their own their own method of doing

943
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,480
it

944
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:01,038
i don't have it memorized i've never

945
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,720
tried it but there's super cheap ways in

946
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:05,440
order to

947
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,480
create co2 on your own without buying

948
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,840
canisters

949
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,440
bags tanks uh so on and so forth but you

950
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:12,639
you run the tanks sometimes right you

951
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,759
used to run the tanks

952
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,240
i have i have co2 tanks so

953
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,519
the biggest thing like if anyone's using

954
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,558
co2 tanks right now

955
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,399
and they're getting them from their

956
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:24,639
local hydro store and they're swapping

957
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:28,558
them out at the local hydro store

958
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:31,919
um it needs to be known that those

959
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,398
tanks were inside of other grow rooms

960
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,759
and if

961
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:36,639
other people aren't clean and they have

962
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,759
bugs

963
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,399
those bugs get on the tank they come

964
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,038
back to the

965
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:45,518
to the grow store they go to the co2 you

966
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:46,960
know factory wherever they fill them

967
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,359
long story short they come back to the

968
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,480
grow store and they go to your room

969
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,759
so i would tell everybody who walked

970
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,319
into the grow shop

971
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,440
here in buffalo that i worked at bleach

972
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:00,000
your tank

973
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,759
before you put it in your room take a

974
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,599
take a washcloth with some bleach water

975
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:07,119
and just bleach it down because

976
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:09,599
properly diluted properly diluted yeah

977
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:12,319
it would just really suck to swap your

978
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,719
co2 tanks out and then have

979
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:16,398
spider mites because the guy before you

980
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,919
wasn't a clean grower or

981
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:19,839
or maybe your growth store isn't the

982
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,038
cleanest grow store you know who knows

983
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:22,959
but yeah if anything that you're

984
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:24,720
bringing into your room and swapping out

985
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,159
regularly like co2 tanks i definitely

986
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,200
recommend cleaning

987
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,640
um how much does it cost for a co2 tank

988
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,399
and regulator and all that stuff oh it

989
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,519
depends

990
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:40,079
um i i remember uh

991
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,960
tank refills were like 20 bucks uh to

992
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:43,439
buy the tank

993
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,440
full for the first time i think is

994
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,080
probably 80 to 100 bucks depending on

995
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,440
where you go um and if you're in a

996
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:51,678
sealed room it lasts

997
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,159
what two weeks or something roughly it

998
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,798
depends on how big the room is you know

999
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,360
like

1000
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:57,918
if you're and how efficient you are like

1001
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:01,359
sealed

1002
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:04,399
room is a very loose term

1003
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:06,240
uh because i a lot of people may think

1004
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:10,000
their rooms are sealed but they're not

1005
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,319
um it's hard to get a

1006
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,839
perfectly sealed room like i'm sure

1007
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:14,639
there's plenty of people who have done

1008
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:16,480
it but

1009
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,000
uh there's always gonna be little spots

1010
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,519
for

1011
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:25,119
stuff to leak out and um

1012
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,880
but the tanks you know you can get three

1013
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,199
four weeks out of the tank in a smaller

1014
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,240
area if you're

1015
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,558
um efficiently sealed and

1016
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,038
and everything and you know the cool

1017
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:39,038
thing about it is if you hook it up to

1018
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:41,278
the monitor and the controller and

1019
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:44,079
everything you can keep that co2 level

1020
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:44,640
exactly where you want it and you can

1021
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:46,798
take

1022
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,240
uh they make this perforated hose that

1023
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,158
comes off the end of the tank

1024
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,519
and then you hang the perforated hose

1025
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,600
right above your canopy

1026
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:58,480
so it's just you know raining co2 right

1027
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,480
over your canopy

1028
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,558
and since we're talking about canopies

1029
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:06,079
in co2

1030
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,960
something that we should be aware of is

1031
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:10,398
that

1032
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:13,760
the the plant leaves are absorbing co2

1033
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:15,519
as the co2 approaches uh

1034
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,839
the edges of the leaf like it's only

1035
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:21,119
consuming co2 right by the leaf

1036
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:24,398
so if you don't have good circulation or

1037
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,480
like constant flow of co2

1038
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:28,559
co2 is heavier than air so it's it's

1039
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,320
going to the ground at all times

1040
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,239
if you don't have circulation pushing

1041
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,240
that co2 around and back up

1042
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,519
keeping your plant leaves kind of moving

1043
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,239
a little bit

1044
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,440
um the plant is going to consume the co2

1045
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,598
around the leaf

1046
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,358
and then you know if it's just stagnant

1047
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,480
air it's not going to get more

1048
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:49,598
co2 you have to have circulation or

1049
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,398
or some sort of you know distribution

1050
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,519
distribution system uh dropping the co2

1051
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:55,918
onto the leaves

1052
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,039
ideally constantly to really get the

1053
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,639
most out of it

1054
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,320
yeah and then it always kind of worried

1055
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:01,920
me with the seedlings with the

1056
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,920
the bag over the cup we talked about

1057
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,519
that earlier it's like there's no air

1058
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,079
circulation going on there how is that

1059
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:09,358
seedling still growing so like it

1060
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,560
when it's small when the plants are

1061
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:11,519
small like that you can kind of get away

1062
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,078
with having

1063
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:15,199
the bag over for 24 48 hours 72 hours

1064
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,720
whatever

1065
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:18,399
or like you said seeds of stone has this

1066
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,078
whole dome that he puts over

1067
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,680
i think those domes actually have a

1068
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,800
ventilation um

1069
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:27,039
sloths so you can you can open it up um

1070
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,400
but yeah for a short period of time and

1071
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:30,400
when the plant is small you can kind of

1072
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,320
get away with it but uh but yeah you

1073
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,240
bring up a very valid point is that air

1074
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,280
circulation is definitely needed

1075
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,000
uh in order to maximize you know co2

1076
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,160
intake

1077
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,199
and so you were saying that like just

1078
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:43,039
you and your

1079
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:45,039
cat and your roommate and everything

1080
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,480
like produce enough co2 in the house and

1081
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:47,759
in that room like if you're spending

1082
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,838
time in there

1083
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,240
to where you don't need a whole lot of

1084
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:54,799
supplemental co2 so

1085
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,838
based on that we can say that talking to

1086
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,280
your plants makes them healthier right

1087
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:00,799
yeah somebody commented on my one of my

1088
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,519
videos and they're like oh you just

1089
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,000
put your gym in there right you just

1090
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:05,519
what

1091
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
put your gym in there then you'd be

1092
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:08,000
constantly

1093
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,519
start working out and then do push-ups

1094
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,200
jumping jacks don't wear a mask in your

1095
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:16,400
grow room

1096
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,838
so speaking of ambient co2 if you don't

1097
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,119
have a sealed room and you're

1098
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:22,159
and you're exhausting um you know out

1099
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,680
the window or

1100
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:28,319
like whatever the ambient co2 in the

1101
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:31,199
in the world is between 250 and 400 i

1102
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:35,359
think it's closer to 400 and varies

1103
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:38,719
on on where you live um it is rising

1104
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:40,239
um but there's tons of like big

1105
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:42,480
greenhouse growers and stuff that

1106
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,439
just can't afford and don't have sealed

1107
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,519
environments to

1108
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,358
to uh implement uh external co2 so they

1109
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,679
just use the ambient co2 and

1110
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:53,039
in order to do that you just really have

1111
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,000
to have good

1112
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:57,519
airflow and circulation you know keeping

1113
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,679
those like i said earlier keeping those

1114
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:02,400
leaves moving

1115
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:04,559
you can still achieve good yields with

1116
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,000
ambient co2

1117
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:11,119
but these new led lights that are coming

1118
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,159
out um such as the roi e720

1119
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,519
they produce so much light that i'm

1120
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,319
pretty sure that in order

1121
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:20,239
to get the most out of the light to get

1122
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,240
the plant to be able to keep up

1123
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,838
and photosynthesize the amount of light

1124
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:26,959
that's being produced

1125
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:29,199
by those uh they they need

1126
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,559
co2 yeah absolutely right i mean

1127
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:31,919
commercial facilities are the commercial

1128
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,639
grow lights right these

1129
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,240
there's a reason why the they're labeled

1130
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:38,559
commercial grow lights is because in

1131
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:40,399
commercial facilities they regulate co2

1132
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:43,358
and they're able to have the

1133
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,880
additional par hit their plants there

1134
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:46,559
are so many home growers who just

1135
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,800
fry their plants with these new grow

1136
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:49,759
lights it's becoming more and more

1137
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,519
common

1138
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,480
even at the proper light distance it's

1139
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:56,320
still they just don't have the co2

1140
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,320
they have low levels of co2 so their

1141
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,680
plants just aren't able to handle it

1142
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,800
you bring up a really great point with

1143
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:05,679
that one so yeah increasing the co2

1144
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,039
in your grow space will allow you to

1145
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:09,679
intake more of that par

1146
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:12,320
and also it allows you to deal with

1147
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:15,919
higher temperatures

1148
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,720
your plant can handle more extremities

1149
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,880
when it has

1150
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:20,480
more co2 i'm pretty sure it can handle

1151
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,000
more nutrients too

1152
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,480
seems like it just kind of like

1153
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,400
turbocharges the the photosynthesis

1154
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,079
process so the plant can just handle

1155
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,920
more it definitely helps

1156
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,440
uh but you know it's definitely not a

1157
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,119
requirement so i know something i could

1158
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,000
have a lot of new growers on this

1159
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,680
channel

1160
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,440
and uh some of them might be thinking

1161
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:39,759
that they need to start implementing co2

1162
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,519
you don't have to the natural levels

1163
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,240
that are there is going to allow your

1164
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:46,159
plant to grow just fine

1165
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,159
i think the amount of yield that it

1166
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:51,598
increased as far as like a

1167
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,559
roi return on investment adding co2

1168
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,559
versus

1169
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,639
not having co2 i think that's a bit

1170
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:58,960
debatable i think it depends on the

1171
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,078
uh the method of co2 how much you're

1172
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
actually spending right if you're

1173
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,079
spending a bunch of

1174
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,079
money on canisters versus

1175
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,440
bags yeah if you're sealed so there's

1176
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,280
too many variables

1177
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,320
to really talk about that one but um

1178
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:17,519
dude when i was a new grower i freaking

1179
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:21,039
walked into a hydroponics store and

1180
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,320
like i don't even know how to describe

1181
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:26,000
it like

1182
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:29,280
i just it was like my brain

1183
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,760
shut off and i i

1184
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,880
i'm no longer just growing a plant they

1185
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,320
made it seem like

1186
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,358
i needed the world to to grow this plant

1187
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,000
right like

1188
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:41,358
oh man it was i i didn't know what i

1189
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,480
needed and what i didn't need right

1190
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:43,598
because they just wanted to sell me

1191
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,440
everything

1192
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,079
oh yeah you're starting to grow co2

1193
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,159
definitely

1194
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,640
i'm like okay well i have three hundred

1195
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,279
dollars and uh the bill is one thousand

1196
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:55,679
so how do we

1197
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,880
what do i what do i really need to just

1198
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:59,279
get going

1199
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,200
truth is you don't need co2 to get going

1200
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,320
uh you don't need a million bottles of

1201
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,000
nutrients

1202
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,440
really you're just growing a plant like

1203
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,400
any other plant and

1204
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,679
and uh keeping it simple as a beginner i

1205
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,119
wish i would have done that

1206
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:14,078
i did not dude i got i over complicated

1207
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,440
things so

1208
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:19,359
much that it was just it was a disaster

1209
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,720
the moral of the story is about that is

1210
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:22,639
like as a new grower

1211
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,838
like it's it's really hard to navigate

1212
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:24,960
and figure out like what you actually

1213
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,639
need and what you don't

1214
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,960
and at the end of the day you need a

1215
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,799
little nutrients you need a little light

1216
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,039
you need a little dirt and a little bit

1217
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,599
of water and some good temperatures

1218
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:37,039
right like you know environment is key

1219
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,720
yep absolutely

1220
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,559
and i think one other thing that we do

1221
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:42,318
need is air circulation right

1222
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,318
let's let's start talking about that and

1223
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:46,800
we'll wrap up with that one

1224
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:48,719
is air circulation is just so key for

1225
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,079
for so many different reasons

1226
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:53,838
um co2 we already talked about how it is

1227
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,560
important for co2 if you have stagnant

1228
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:56,480
air

1229
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:58,559
your plants aren't getting the optimal

1230
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,559
one on co2 because

1231
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:02,318
it's directly right by the leaf is is

1232
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:04,400
really what matters for for them in

1233
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:05,039
taking co2 so air circulation is very

1234
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,318
important

1235
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:08,480
you had mentioned that you like those

1236
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:10,800
plants to be dancing at all times

1237
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,240
i agree with that just a little bit yeah

1238
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,440
yep i agree with that

1239
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,639
um i also aim for that what i do is i'll

1240
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,480
have an oscillating fan

1241
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,078
above the canopy or right yeah right

1242
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,240
above the canopy

1243
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,760
so my plants are able to sway from that

1244
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:26,318
so there's air circulation there

1245
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,440
and i also have a oscillating fan on the

1246
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:30,079
lower part

1247
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,679
of my canopy you know it's usually on

1248
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,280
the ground and it's blowing i actually

1249
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,118
have those clip-on fans now

1250
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,800
that clip directly under the grow tent

1251
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,599
so this is super easy i can just adjust

1252
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,000
the height

1253
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,440
on the grow tent but above the canopy

1254
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,880
below the canopy

1255
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,200
those are two things i usually aim for

1256
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,720
and that's usually gives good air

1257
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:49,919
circulation that plus

1258
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:52,959
my inline fan popping on and off

1259
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,400
for air exchange that's usually a pretty

1260
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,079
simple method

1261
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,838
that's usually what i aim for now i've

1262
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,318
run one

1263
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:01,599
oscillating fan in the past and it died

1264
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:04,880
overnight

1265
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,559
and uh when i found it there's some part

1266
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,519
there was some bud rod that already

1267
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:10,000
started

1268
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:11,358
and once it starts even if you fix that

1269
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,440
issue

1270
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:15,759
it still can continue to grow within the

1271
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,358
buds and unfortunately two weeks later i

1272
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:22,240
harvested and then uh drying came and

1273
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:23,759
i opened it up to some some bud rods so

1274
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,759
that wasn't good but so now

1275
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,680
i'm running two oscillating fans of my

1276
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,880
grow tent at all times

1277
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,039
what do you usually do for air

1278
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,200
circulation it's just a kind of rewind

1279
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,800
to talk about oscillating fans

1280
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:36,559
you know that i've been doing tons of

1281
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,640
research into oscillating fans because

1282
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:39,358
i'm trying to find a high quality one to

1283
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,719
bring

1284
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:45,838
onto the happy hydro website and

1285
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:48,159
what i've found is that most of these

1286
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:51,199
oscillating fans the smaller six

1287
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:53,039
inch ones suck like they die on you like

1288
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:56,000
you said you had one die

1289
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:58,159
um and so i mean i think it's worth

1290
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,358
mentioning that if any cust if anyone

1291
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,440
out there is doing

1292
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:03,119
is looking to get an oscillating fan to

1293
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,639
do your research i'm not going to call

1294
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,720
out brands specifically

1295
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:07,679
in the video but do your research and

1296
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,159
make sure the brand

1297
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,199
that you're purchasing from you know has

1298
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:14,399
a high quality

1299
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:16,000
fan a high quality uh oscillating fan

1300
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,160
because like you said they do

1301
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
if it's a low quality quality fan they

1302
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:23,440
do eventually die out

1303
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,358
and um when they do

1304
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,358
three months worth of work can can be

1305
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:29,519
out the out the window so

1306
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:30,559
you know is saving ten dollars on your

1307
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:33,838
oscillating fan

1308
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:35,838
worth risking a failure i don't think it

1309
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:37,599
is i have no problem mentioning brands

1310
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:38,799
if they have defective products

1311
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,359
the one that you're i think you're

1312
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,280
talking about is the the vivo sun or

1313
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:44,639
some people call vivoson i think it's i

1314
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,800
don't know which way it's pronounced

1315
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:48,799
i've been saying vivo sun and they

1316
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,119
haven't corrected me on it so

1317
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,079
i'm gonna run with that but um i've been

1318
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,599
talking with them

1319
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,280
about that in particular because i did

1320
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,800
have a fan that died from them

1321
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,400
and if you look on their reviews it was

1322
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,039
just flooded with people who have

1323
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,559
that fan uh that would die on them and

1324
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:04,318
what they had mentioned is that they

1325
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,078
have revised that fan

1326
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:08,159
so that issue no longer happens what was

1327
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,960
happening the root cause for that

1328
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:11,759
is as the fan was oscillating the wiring

1329
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,639
inside was

1330
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,119
constantly rubbing up against the side

1331
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:18,480
and then there was basically kind of a

1332
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,318
short circuit i don't think that's the

1333
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,199
right term for it but the wiring would

1334
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:23,440
just get

1335
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:25,519
yeah the wiring would just get um

1336
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,519
annihilated from moving back and forth

1337
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:28,559
it would wear out and then it would no

1338
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,800
longer

1339
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:32,480
have the electricity to the fan they

1340
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,480
said that they fixed that problem we'll

1341
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,480
see if that new generation of fans

1342
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,760
if that problem is fixed or not but yeah

1343
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,400
you bring up a group i'm not willing to

1344
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,640
be a guinea pig for it

1345
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,079
neither neither will i uh put my

1346
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:46,480
customers up to that um

1347
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,079
if they do fix it and uh you know they

1348
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,199
put out a good product and

1349
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,400
you know i'd be happy to distribute uh a

1350
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:55,838
quality product but

1351
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,519
um until that's you know verified um we

1352
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:59,199
probably won't have a vivosun fan on

1353
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:02,079
happy hydro site right now

1354
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:03,919
i'll be the guinea pig perfect i'll be

1355
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,480
the guinea pig if the new one they send

1356
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,000
me

1357
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,760
is legit then hey i'll let you know

1358
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,960
if you get if you get bud rod i think

1359
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,440
you should send them a bill for your

1360
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,280
long

1361
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:18,318
harvest it'll be nice if i could do that

1362
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,760
that would be really nice

1363
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:21,679
but what do you usually do for air

1364
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,400
circulation

1365
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:26,239
so a cheap thing that people can do

1366
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,838
that's pretty reliable

1367
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:32,799
is to just buy a cheap box fan

1368
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:33,838
take to a grow light hangers hang it

1369
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,839
from the ceiling

1370
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:37,119
and have it blowing air right between

1371
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:40,960
the top of the canopy

1372
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,720
and uh the light fixture

1373
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,240
okay so vertical it's vertical it's not

1374
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:45,118
you know i'm talking about horizontal on

1375
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:46,719
the top of the

1376
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,960
grow tower vertical right vertical okay

1377
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:52,480
so like the side of the grow temperature

1378
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,199
yeah um so that's like just like a cheap

1379
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,760
way to

1380
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:57,598
to really move a lot of air i mean a box

1381
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:01,359
the box fan will move a ton of air

1382
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:03,359
um how did you how do you fix it up

1383
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:04,960
just like hang it from grow light

1384
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:07,440
hangers grow light hangers

1385
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,679
okay yeah and then it can just blow you

1386
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,079
know it's not ideal for like a 4x4 grow

1387
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:12,399
tent

1388
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,359
but if you're growing in like a bedroom

1389
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,760
or something

1390
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:16,799
um and you need to move a lot of air

1391
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,040
like you know

1392
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,400
hang up hanging a big box fan it's like

1393
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:23,679
a budget

1394
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,519
way to get the job done got it um

1395
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:27,519
obviously it's not as great as like

1396
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:28,880
having oscillating fans like mounted to

1397
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:31,039
the walls and stuff but

1398
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,079
um you know that's that's the way i was

1399
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:34,159
a budget grower

1400
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,200
like when i did my growing you know i

1401
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:38,078
was

1402
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:38,559
between the ages of 14. i don't tell my

1403
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,680
mom

1404
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:43,838
and uh 22 i wasn't just

1405
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:45,039
i didn't have a lot of money to to to

1406
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:46,880
invest so i found

1407
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:48,639
you know cheap ways to do things that

1408
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,079
worked really well uh

1409
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,759
and you mentioned that you put your

1410
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,760
oscillating fan

1411
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,359
you know over the canopy in between the

1412
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,440
light

1413
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,119
another huge benefit there is those

1414
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,119
lights are putting off heat

1415
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,920
and if you can just pull that heat right

1416
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,680
off uh before it hits the canopy

1417
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,960
that allows you to push those lights a

1418
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:08,879
little bit closer

1419
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,318
up up to a certain extent the closer

1420
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,400
that you can get the light

1421
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:16,239
usually means that the deeper that the

1422
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,599
light will reach and you know the denser

1423
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:19,659
the buds you could produce

1424
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,960
up to a certain extent

1425
00:47:19,659 --> 00:47:22,639
[Music]

1426
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,159
but yeah that's a trick that i use

1427
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:27,519
hanging the box fan cheap trick

1428
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:29,279
um if you have the space then you have

1429
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:29,920
like an oscillating just standing

1430
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,240
pedestal

1431
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,358
fan laying around your house that you

1432
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:35,358
can just use

1433
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:36,400
you know grabbing that throwing in there

1434
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:39,440
is a good way to

1435
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:42,639
to just to have a budget option um

1436
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:45,119
in the grow tent i think that

1437
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:47,039
if this oscillating fan thing is dealt

1438
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,280
with and like they have high quality

1439
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:52,480
oscillating fans that can clip on to

1440
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,720
the um the grow tent pole

1441
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,838
you know that's perfect but if they

1442
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:59,598
don't there's there

1443
00:47:55,838 --> 00:48:01,759
there are um i think the monkey fan

1444
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,000
uh there are fans that clip on to the

1445
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,119
grow tent pole that don't oscillate

1446
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,920
but but still you know are small combat

1447
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,800
compact uh and can push a decent amount

1448
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,960
of air into your

1449
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,640
you know four by four tent or whatever

1450
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,119
um one thing to mention about that

1451
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:17,039
though

1452
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,039
is you just gotta be careful to avoid

1453
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:19,679
wind burn right wind burn is a real

1454
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:21,759
thing

1455
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:23,838
if you're constantly blowing air onto

1456
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,680
the plant consistently

1457
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:27,519
the plant can have a stunt growth that

1458
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:28,719
dries out the leaves the outer part of

1459
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:29,280
the leaves and you'll see the edges

1460
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:31,679
start to

1461
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,359
to brown and curl down and things like

1462
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:35,279
that happens it may i've happened to me

1463
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:36,719
multiple times and also even with the

1464
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,880
oscillating fans uh

1465
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:40,480
if it's blowing directly onto the buds

1466
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,318
those white pistols

1467
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,519
they turn brown and start to recede a

1468
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:45,759
lot faster

1469
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,039
due to the amount of air that's hitting

1470
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,880
them so

1471
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:50,639
um you'll notice that i know there's

1472
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,079
some girls who have come across that

1473
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:54,159
in the past so explain that to me again

1474
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,039
quickly it's so like in uh in what part

1475
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:58,239
of bloom do

1476
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:59,599
is this a concern i mean really any part

1477
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:00,558
of bloom i mean i've been an early

1478
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,800
flower

1479
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,559
and i had an oscillating fan and every

1480
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:08,800
time it went to one side

1481
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:12,319
in blue it was hitting a bud and the bud

1482
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:16,000
on that branch the hairs the pistols

1483
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:17,679
went from white to brown and

1484
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,119
started to recede and then you look at

1485
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:21,358
the other parts of the plant

1486
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,960
and that wasn't the case now how much

1487
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:25,759
that's going to actually impact growth

1488
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,838
i don't know um but it certainly had

1489
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,400
stressed out the the plant to the point

1490
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:31,599
where

1491
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,960
the pistols had turned color and receded

1492
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:35,039
it's really interesting i never thought

1493
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,800
about that or

1494
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:38,318
i guess i just never noticed that but it

1495
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,760
makes sense i mean obviously the

1496
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:40,400
oscillating air is going to affect your

1497
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,839
vpd

1498
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,680
in the way that the plant is transpiring

1499
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:47,519
and you know drinking water

1500
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:48,799
damn i had something to say but i'm

1501
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,000
losing it

1502
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:54,400
oh okay so if you

1503
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,679
if you just have a carbon filter sitting

1504
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,079
on the ground

1505
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:59,199
and you have a fan on top of it like an

1506
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,760
inline fan

1507
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:02,639
and you're just you know scrubbing air

1508
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,839
in the room

1509
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:05,920
and you're sucking in air through the

1510
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:09,358
carbon filter and then pushing that air

1511
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,240
straight up um it's a good way to get

1512
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:13,519
the co2

1513
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:15,838
that sinks to the floor

1514
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:17,199
back up and above your plant canopy so

1515
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:18,078
that's like you know if you're not

1516
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:19,439
worried about

1517
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,960
if you're in a sealed environment and

1518
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,760
you have an extra carbon filter and a

1519
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,519
fan just like

1520
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,119
laying around and you're looking for a

1521
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:26,800
way to get like some circulation going

1522
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,480
in your room you could just set that on

1523
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,680
the ground with the fan on top of it

1524
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,280
blowing that air up uh you know 24 7

1525
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:34,799
you know another way to just get some

1526
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,200
circulation going in there and it'll

1527
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,839
also you know that filter will catch

1528
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:40,558
some pathogens and things other than

1529
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:42,799
odors that

1530
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,760
you probably don't want floating around

1531
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,440
in the room

1532
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,119
that's interesting and i've never done

1533
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,639
that scrubbing method

1534
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,200
before so i've never heard of that i

1535
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:54,639
think it's a great great tip for sure

1536
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:55,439
um when you're scrubbing so uh the only

1537
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:57,199
problem is

1538
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,039
if you're worried about odors right so

1539
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:03,118
if you're just scrubbing in the room

1540
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:05,679
you're not creating negative pressure so

1541
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,640
negative pressure for those that who

1542
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:09,199
aren't aware

1543
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:10,799
it's basically so if you have a carbon

1544
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:13,039
filter and a fan inside of your grow

1545
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,640
tent and you're exhausting air out of it

1546
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:17,519
you may notice that the sides of your

1547
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:20,879
grow tent start to suck in a little bit

1548
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:23,199
what that means is that no no air

1549
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,280
inside of that grow tent is just gonna

1550
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:28,318
leak out of like the zipper

1551
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,519
or a hole or whatever as long as you

1552
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:33,519
have negative pressure in the grow tent

1553
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:35,519
all of the air that leaves the grow tent

1554
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:38,400
goes through the filter first

1555
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:38,960
now if you remove that negative pressure

1556
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,680
so you're

1557
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,720
i'm no longer exhausting the air out of

1558
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:44,799
my tent

1559
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,399
i'm just you know scrubbing the air

1560
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,000
inside of the tent i've got the filter

1561
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,639
on the ground i've got the fan on the

1562
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,440
filter

1563
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:52,318
it's just scrubbing the air inside um

1564
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,559
air is going to

1565
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:58,079
smelly air is going to leak out through

1566
00:51:54,559 --> 00:52:01,200
your zipper through your ports through

1567
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:04,240
through whatever hospitals

1568
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:06,879
actually use negative pressure rooms for

1569
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:08,479
patients and basically anybody who who

1570
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,760
may have some sort of

1571
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,199
uh airborne illness or something

1572
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,280
you know they put them in a they put

1573
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:17,279
them in a

1574
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,359
negative pressure room that way the

1575
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,040
virus doesn't you know accidentally

1576
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:21,838
creep out of the bottom of the door of

1577
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:24,079
that room

1578
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:26,880
the airflow is constantly creating a

1579
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,240
vacuum in the room

1580
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,880
you know so i think it's kind of cool

1581
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:33,439
how negative pressure is used

1582
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,800
in uh you know a hospital environment to

1583
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,960
to protect from

1584
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,480
uh you know pathogens and stuff

1585
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,119
infecting humans

1586
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,240
and it's also used in the growing world

1587
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,559
to prevent

1588
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:45,679
odors from just leaking out wherever

1589
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:49,119
they feel like

1590
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:51,440
so it's a lesson in negative pressure

1591
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,640
interesting that's good stuff okay so i

1592
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,559
think it pretty much wraps

1593
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:56,400
everything up our in talk about

1594
00:52:54,559 --> 00:53:00,240
environment we talked about temperature

1595
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,760
humidity co2 air circulation this isn't

1596
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:03,279
everything you need to know about those

1597
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,800
things these are just kind of a

1598
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,160
discussion that we're having uh

1599
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,760
you know what we do for those different

1600
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:08,879
things to control those those pieces of

1601
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,599
the environment

1602
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,680
and uh i think it's beneficial since you

1603
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,838
know we live in different climates

1604
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:17,118
so talking about these things definitely

1605
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:18,239
there's some things that i didn't know

1606
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,920
that you do which is

1607
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:21,679
this is awesome and i'm not sure if you

1608
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,599
knew that everything that i had talked

1609
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:26,799
about as far as controlling environment

1610
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,359
in in the desert region so it depends on

1611
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,760
which inv

1612
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:31,440
which climate you live in always you

1613
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,119
know feel free to make adjustments as

1614
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,800
necessary in order to

1615
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:37,599
get your environment's conditions into

1616
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:40,160
the ideal ranges yeah and uh if anyone

1617
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:41,760
really if anyone has any different you

1618
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:42,318
know way that they deal with humidity

1619
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,559
temperature

1620
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:45,519
everything tell us in the comments um

1621
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,280
you know this isn't the be

1622
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:48,800
all end-all these aren't the be-all

1623
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,640
end-all ways to uh

1624
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,480
control your environment and i'm sure

1625
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:54,639
there's things that we miss and stuff so

1626
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,559
please comment in the description let us

1627
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:57,920
know like if we're wrong or if there's a

1628
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,640
better way or a different way to do

1629
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,480
something

1630
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:04,799

just gonna say is i would love to know

1635
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,960
how you control

1636
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:16,558
uh your environment conditions everyone

1637

that what people do in order to make

1642
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:27,199
things easier as far as controlling

1643
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,960
their environments so

1644
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:30,719
um slap that down in the comments
