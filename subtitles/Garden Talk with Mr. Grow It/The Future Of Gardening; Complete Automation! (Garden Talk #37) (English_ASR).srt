1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,160
coming up on garden talk the ai is it is

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,480
people training those systems then

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,039
everyone could have the power of those

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,880
expert opinions via computer vision

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,359
without a person actually looking

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,160
personally at their plants one of them

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:21,118
would be a ph either increase or

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,960
decrease you typically don't need both

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:26,719
you'll find you want to correct one

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,519
direction only i built six scales which

11
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,919
are all wi-fi enabled or part of the

12
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,039
system and every minute they report

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,239
their weight

14
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,000
you really shouldn't actually have a

15
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,479
clogging issue if you always have a

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,359
pre-filter by the way for your pump

17
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,959

18
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,960
enable you

20

done quite a bit of work with an

103
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,400
automated

104
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,799
system

105
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,640
box whatever you want to call it an

106
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,360
indoor growth setup called the plant

107
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,719
studio and before we get too far ahead

108
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,799
you're going to be talking all about

109
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,959
that today and just automation in

110
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,799
general that can be applied to you know

111
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,719
homegrown in particular i feel like

112
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,319
before we get into the details on all of

113
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,080
that though can you tell us a little bit

114
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:11,518
about yourself and kind of how you got

115
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,879
into this space

116
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,519
sure yeah my name is uh simon romanski

117
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,918
i'm uh live in massachusetts i'm

118
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,879
originally from england that's where my

119
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,478
accent comes from uh i've been growing

120
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,478
for a few years

121
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,399
i

122
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,319
i think i got into growing i mean i'm a

123
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,039
technical person so i think i got into

124
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,639
growing when i was um in disneyland i

125
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,120
think it was that it was epcot and

126
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,040
there's a ride called the living land

127
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,959
which is a ride that goes through a

128
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,120
greenhouse and i remember looking at

129
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,839
all these different methods of growing

130
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,600
and

131
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:52,319
it just looked very technical and it it

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,280
just i was blown away by it and in

133
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,959
particular i remember the aeroponics uh

134
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:00,000
section they had these plants on the

135
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,079
this track that would uh revolve around

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,439
and they would be suspended they're just

137
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,879
holding the plants and the roots are

138
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,478
just dangling in the air then they would

139
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,918
take them through this little chamber

140
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,800
where they would get their

141
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,799
mist their water and nutrients basically

142
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,639
and i i just was blown away the fact

143
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,038
that you know plants could even be grown

144
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,918
that way so i think the it's always been

145
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:22,560
the technical that interesting uh you

146
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,719
know different side of growing that i

147
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,759
found interesting and really what got me

148
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,560
started at least um i do think a little

149
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,360
differently after growing uh it's not

150
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,079
all about the hydroponics i'm definitely

151
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,038
a fan of lots of other you know living

152
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:41,038
soils and things like that so um but

153
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,360
that's basically where i really think i

154
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,199
got my my start from

155
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,400
nice nice and i know before we started

156
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,280
recording you talked about how you went

157
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,038
to school for is it engineering uh

158
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,638
mechanical yeah or software engineering

159
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,639
or can you talk to us about that

160
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,360
yeah i went for um it was information

161
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,240
management and technology and basically

162
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,038
it's almost it's a went to syracuse um

163
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,759
and

164
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:07,360
it's a cross between computer science

165
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:10,080
and management so uh i always say i

166
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,800
don't consider myself a programmer more

167
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:16,000
of a developer so i like

168
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,439
making solutions with technology as

169
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,478
opposed to just

170
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,800
you know

171
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,959
i don't write the uh the drivers for

172
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,079
stuff and all the the super technical

173
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:28,638
stuff but there are so many tools and

174
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,639
frameworks and apis and things out there

175
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,199
that i love kind of

176
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,759
putting stuff together in order to solve

177
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,759
problems so that's that's really that's

178
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,759
what i went to school for and it you

179
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,240
know it's it's been a fit for me ever

180
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,680
since gotcha you talked about what you

181
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,199
just mentioned it kind of relates to

182
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,038
what i used to do i used to work for

183
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,680
amazon.com worked in the fulfillment

184
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,199
center for eight years i was actually in

185
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,360
their support side of things too working

186
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,199
with worldwide operations but one thing

187
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,560
that they do in their fulfillment

188
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,478
centers and i'm sure there's some people

189
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,280
watching this that have worked at amazon

190
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,038
or work at amazon right now but

191
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,478
they pound in your head like the process

192
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,800
improvement side of things like

193
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,639
streamlining so my mindset has always

194
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,199
been like how do we make things more

195
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,800
efficient how do we automate things to

196
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,280
reduce the amount of labor hours that

197
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,879
are are put towards a process

198
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,879
yeah so

199
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,759
that was actually my first job was and

200
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,159
um

201
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,759
was working in fulfillment i worked at a

202
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,280
fulfillment center

203
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,639
and i like the

204
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,119
um

205
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,280
the order and inventory management

206
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,120
and and the back end seeing the packages

207
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,719
and the orders and inventory came in and

208
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,560
basically what i did for this company is

209
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,000
i kind of webified them um it was uh

210
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,680
dating myself a little bit it was a

211
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,120
while ago where people were still like

212
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,199
that the internet built some people

213
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,598
didn't even have uh dedicated internet

214
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,360
access uh you know continuous internet

215
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:52,719
access and um

216
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,560
i basically had something uh wrote

217
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,199
some web tools and a web application to

218
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,918
allow clients

219
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,560
to

220
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,878
look and check on inventories inventory

221
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,038
and orders themselves without having to

222
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,879
call the customer service rep because

223
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,800
when i started all these calls were

224
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,319
coming in i thought that's crazy why why

225
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,240
are you calling you should be able to

226
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,800
just look that up yourself

227
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,038
so that's kind of where i began was

228
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,759
really fulfillment and again i just like

229
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,240
the

230
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,479
solution providing i like going back in

231
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,879
the you know in the warehouse because i

232
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,000
worked in the front office and

233
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,840
seeing

234
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,120
were those pack slips or did it make

235
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,679
sense for

236
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,479
the pic pack ship part of the

237
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,000
fulfillment and so yeah that's

238
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,120
similar also with the with the

239
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,120
fulfillment

240
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,719
yeah so definitely some similarities

241
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,480
there and then you took those skills and

242
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,560
now you've applied them to horticulture

243
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,360
which is pretty cool can you give us a

244
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,799
high level overview of the plant studio

245
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,039
that you have created

246
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:56,000
yeah i'm sure it's a

247
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,240
it's a cultivation machine and it's

248
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,799
basically there to control

249
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,600
everything above the ground and below

250
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:06,079
the ground it's not really ground

251
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,839
pots or chambers or whatever your grow

252
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,120
method is but

253
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,080
basically root zone and uh environment

254
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,639
above

255
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,959
and the whole point of it was really to

256
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:20,240
automate as much of the time consuming

257
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:22,719
stuff as possible because i you know

258
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,000
when it comes to watering i would forget

259
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,680
or if i'm away or if uh you know did if

260
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,639
you're doing hydroponics and you're

261
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:35,039
wanting to monitor the the ph or um

262
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:38,000
water levels and temperatures and stuff

263
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:40,319
like that so basically i did it so that

264
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,200
i didn't have to spend as much time

265
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,040
doing the stuff that i didn't enjoy

266
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,278
doing i i didn't mind the plant

267
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,360
manipulation stuff but i don't like the

268
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:52,240
stuff where you have to constantly stay

269
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,959
on top of it or you know having to go

270
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,399
and manually change things in the room

271
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,319
environmentally

272
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,080
in order you know because

273
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,920
you know that the temperature's too high

274
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,120
the humidity is off or something like

275
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:07,439
that so that was that was basically my

276
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,759
i always say i'm i'm inherently lazy but

277
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,160
i'll also go way out of my way to try

278
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,639
and automate and to simplify it for

279
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,719
myself gotcha and actually on your

280
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,559
website i'll mention it right now so

281
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,160
people can check it out if they want to

282
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,559
and kind of get a visual of what we're

283
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:25,559
about to dive deeper into

284
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:30,078
it's www.plant

285
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:30,879
s-t-u-d dot io it's plant studio but

286
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,519
it's

287
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:35,600
you don't even need the ws it's plant

288
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,600
stud dot io

289
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,440
and so it

290
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,519
couldn't get the dot com but uh you know

291
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,120
i kinda like the dot io makes sense in a

292
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,360
way because it is all about you know

293
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,679
input and output so it's plant studio

294
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,440
with the dot before the io so check that

295
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,719
out if you are interested in that i'll

296
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,040
have in the link in the description

297
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,040
section below on youtube so you can

298
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,120
easily access that there's a great video

299
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,360
right on the home page which talks about

300
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,560
just a ton of things within a very short

301
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,959
period of time

302
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:06,000
about all this automation so let's let's

303
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:09,039
dive deeper into this let's start with

304
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,559
the grow area what size growth space is

305
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,719
it you know is and what is the plant

306
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,838
studio made out of

307
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,440
um well so the grow area is it's a five

308
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,240
by nine and it has um

309
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,279
uh

310
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,079
so basically a two light setup and uh

311
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,399
it's

312
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,719
eight feet tall because high always

313
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,799
becomes a big issue when growing you you

314
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,879
a lot of people especially indoors are

315
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,879
limited by the height size i'm pretty

316
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,838
fortunate to be able to have you know

317
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:41,039
pretty high ceilings um the overall

318
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,120
dimensions inside the the grow machine

319
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,199
is five by 12

320
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,959
but the that extra

321
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,480
three feet of space is there to

322
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:51,439
accommodate you know the air

323
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,039
conditioning dehumidifier fans and

324
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,399
and uh basically the equipment that

325
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:59,278
helps manage the environment and gives

326
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,958
me some space to actually to you know to

327
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:04,559
get inside the the machine uh to

328
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,958
tend to the plants

329
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,599
and um that the machine itself is the

330
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,958
the box itself is made by um from

331
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,519
insulated panels that i came up with

332
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:18,799
it's basically

333
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,078
wood that is

334
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,359
sandwiches

335
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:26,799
some high density insulated foam and

336
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:31,278
then these panels slot together to make

337
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:35,439
um you know to to make a well insulated

338
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:38,078
um and sealed box so they um you know

339
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,839
it's not your typical stick construction

340
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:41,519
like frame where people frame it and

341
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,880
then put it up and then insulate it

342
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,560
these are like panels okay so this is a

343
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,439
sealed environment just to confirm it's

344
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:51,759
a sealed environment you don't have a

345
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,600
an intake vent an exhaust fan

346
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,759
everything's just kind of recirculating

347
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,560
within that environment is that correct

348
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,319
yeah yeah i i actually uh i learned this

349
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,638
the hard way because

350
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,879
my initial grow um

351
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,799
was um

352
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,559
i didn't have any i wasn't considering

353
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,879
any kind of air circulation i mean

354
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:14,319
that's that's how clueless i was and i

355
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:16,240
went away i came back and um i was

356
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,720
growing tomatoes in the in the early

357
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,360
days and i basically came back and it

358
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,320
was just a horrible stink

359
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,399
and

360
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,720
i didn't know i thought something was

361
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,399
rotten and basically i realized that

362
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,600
when you

363
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,440
um

364
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,360
basically uh

365
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,279
drown or just deprive the plants um not

366
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,519
drown actually it's like just remove all

367
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,519
the co2 from the air

368
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,879
uh they are not happy just like we

369
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,919
wouldn't like you know getting rid of

370
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:49,679
our oxygen and they just make an

371
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:51,679
a crazy smell so when i smelled and i

372
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,078
realized i go oh

373
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,399
i i need to change the air then i

374
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,000
realized i had two different choices

375
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,639
and you can either and that's a lot of

376
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,958
the choices it's like do you circulate i

377
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,440
mean do you do you have a sealed room or

378
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,679
do you um circulate and bring in the

379
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,279
outside in uh environment

380
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,638
and um

381
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:17,198
in the end i just decided that a sealed

382
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,959
room is just much easier to control

383
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,000
and to maintain

384
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,479
because

385
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,879
i'm not pulling any i'm not dependent on

386
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,800
an outside environment that i'm then

387
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,879
pulling into that room

388
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,958
sometimes it might make sense it's

389
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,439
cooler outside i can bring the air in

390
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:36,239
and it could cool it down and it's to

391
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,480
the humidity builds up quickly and

392
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,440
sometimes you go well we've got to pump

393
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,039
the air out and get rid of that that

394
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,480
extra humidity

395
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:45,759
but then

396
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,079
um

397
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,679
again you're dependent on that outside

398
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:52,000
environment

399
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:54,319
so the trade-off though is then if

400
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,679
you're dealing with temperatures

401
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,199
typically you're going to be dealing

402
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:01,838
with cooling um because the lights put

403
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,958
off heat it's insulated so now you have

404
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,120
to cool

405
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,278
the heat of the lights you have to cool

406
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,879
that excess heat that comes off the

407
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:10,879
dehumidifier

408
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,879
because it does still put out heat just

409
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,360
despite the fact that it's got the the

410
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:18,159
cooling side you know it overall

411
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,519
generates more than it um removes

412
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:23,439
um but again the benefit was also

413
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,639
controlling the environment not pulling

414
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,240
any pests or any pathogens potentially

415
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,919
in

416
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,320
the down

417
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,958
the tricky part is making sure that you

418
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,639
can size the equipment

419
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,679
so that it is able to deal with

420
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,159
say

421
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:44,958
late stages of growth where your plants

422
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:47,198
are big and they're putting off a lot of

423
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,719
um they're transpiring a lot there's a

424
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:52,078
lot of humidity

425
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,440
and um the lights are full bright um

426
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:54,958
cranked up

427
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,639
and um

428
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,198
you know that that's that's a little

429
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,680
that that was a little tricky but um i

430
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,639
would say that my my one tip is as far

431
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,879
as

432
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,198
people being able to size correctly you

433
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,278
take take the wattage of all the things

434
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,000
that you have in that box

435
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:14,078
and then multiply that by four

436
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,039
and then whatever number you get from

437
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,638
that

438
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:20,078
is basically how many btus you would

439
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,120
need to

440
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,359
remove

441
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,560
that you would get so for me

442
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:30,240
about 3 000 my machine running at full

443
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:31,958
capacity uh with both lights on uh with

444
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,399
the air conditioning and the

445
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:36,559
dehumidification running and when i'm

446
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,360
running the large dehumidifier

447
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:43,679
there's about 3 000 watts max that that

448
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:46,959
runs so 3 000 times 4 1200

449
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:51,519
12 000 excuse me and 12 000 is

450
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:54,078
considered one ton so i i have a one ton

451
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,959
mini split and it's actually

452
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:59,039
more than capable of cooling because

453
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:02,078
you know with your watts

454
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:04,558
that is for also heat watch the the

455
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,558
like light a lot of that is going into

456
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:09,279
your photons and it's not coming off

457
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:12,078
directly as as heat so

458
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,160
it's good to over more oversized you

459
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,678
don't want to go too big but you

460
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,279
definitely have to make sure that you

461
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,759
can keep up with the the heat and the

462
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,678
humidity in that in the you know sealed

463
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:24,240
room that makes sense and just to

464
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,480
reiterate you said two lights that

465
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,838
you're running the leds

466
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,000
and according to your website that they

467
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,918
come in at 2.3 micromoles per joule so

468
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,519
you got some good efficiency there i

469
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,440
know people going to be asking this can

470
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,679
you tell us what diodes and driver

471
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,840
you're using for those lights i you know

472
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,400
i don't know i've had these for a few

473
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,918
years they're the fluence um

474
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,360
spider

475
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,280
the spider x plus and

476
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,119
they don't actually even make these bars

477
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,160
anymore which is almost unfortunate

478
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,399
because i

479
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,000
i'm definitely a big fan of the bar

480
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,120
style light fixtures

481
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,480
because

482
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,199
i believe it's

483
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,919
most closely represents the sun

484
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,319
and when it comes to like uh penetration

485
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,559
of the light for your plants

486
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,879
if you've got my whole ceiling basically

487
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,200
there's like 16 bars that go from the

488
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,919
back to the you know all the way across

489
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,880
the grow area and

490
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,520
the sun is basically like a giant beam

491
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,400
coming down it's not it as much as a

492
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,160
spotlight it's a point

493
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,080
as far as we're concerned the photons

494
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,200
are coming um

495
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,759
they

496
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,880
they're not coming from a point um

497
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,839
it doesn't it's

498
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,799
it makes a lot more sense and

499
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,240
um

500
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:44,879
the other thing i liked with the leds um

501
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,919
is that you can get them a lot closer to

502
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,720
your plants um i i

503
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,679
depending on what style of leds that you

504
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,240
use

505
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,559
it will vary how much

506
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,400
how many how much your photons drop off

507
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:00,399
based on the distance

508
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,919
because the fluents don't have the

509
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,679
lenses on these

510
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:08,160
the diodes

511
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:10,480
i find that the the drop off in your ptm

512
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,919
ppfd is really

513
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,279
um

514
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:18,000
if the photon rate drops off a lot

515
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,960
if you just for every foot you you bring

516
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,519
it up

517
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,919
so you know i do play around with

518
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,839
dimming the lights but then also being

519
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,320
able to bring the lights

520
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:31,519
down closer to the canopy

521
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:34,639
using less electricity generating less

522
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,319
heat less air conditioning to require to

523
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,200
cool it

524
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,079
but again towards the end those lights

525
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,360
are just

526
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:45,279
just cranked up and uh the plants they

527
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:46,719
they don't care they they want as much

528
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,960
as you can give them

529
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,360
gotcha that makes sense a couple more

530
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,519
things about the actual equipment and

531
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,839
setup before we dive into the actual

532
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,200
platform so with the sealed environment

533
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:00,319
generally speaking i think a lot of

534
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,720
people know this is you gotta run co2 i

535
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:05,038
believe you're running co2 tanks

536
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,919
inside the studio you probably have a

537
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,119
you must have a humidifier dehumidifier

538
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,200
can you talk to us about the equipment

539
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,719
and then also air circulation can you

540
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,440
talk to us about how all of that is kind

541
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,279
of

542
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,919
set up within the space and how the air

543
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,038
circulation is achieved in there yeah so

544
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,320
um

545
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:26,400
uh the the co2 side of things i have two

546
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:30,480
tanks uh that sit outside they uh piped

547
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:34,159
in and the co2 which naturally drops uh

548
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,159
there's uh two tubes above the fan which

549
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,960
sits at one end of the which is the

550
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,159
machine side of the the system side of

551
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,600
the studio

552
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,440
that

553
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:49,439
blows the co2 and circulates it around

554
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:52,159
as it's needed i have a sensor that can

555
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,200
be raised and lowered um

556
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:58,880
manually from the machine side

557
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:03,120
that i keep at basically canopy level

558
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:07,280
so that co2 sensor is basically i'm i i

559
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:10,959
do run elevated co2 levels um

560
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,240
which is a big benefit of having a

561
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,960
sealed room

562
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,759
and the other thing is that

563
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,880
because the room is so well sealed

564
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:24,879
that for an entire grow i won't

565
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,760
use maybe 10 pounds of co2

566
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,799
and i think a lot of people struggle

567
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:30,960
with

568
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,839
tanks saying well you know i'm burning

569
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,079
through tanks all the time but when the

570
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,319
room is really well sealed

571
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,158
um it's it's

572
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:42,879
very it's a minimal

573
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:46,000
overhead um i did have one at one

574
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,799
situation where my tank did run out

575
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,440
and um what i ended up doing was you

576
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:54,240
know i have a secondary tank when it

577
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,120
detects that one tank is is you know

578
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,759
when when when the tank is on

579
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,158
and the system sees that the co2 levels

580
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:05,119
aren't rising it will then assume that

581
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,840
that tank is empty and then flip over to

582
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,639
the

583
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,798
the secondary tank because again you

584
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,038
know what happens if the co2 runs out

585
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:16,480
and you don't want to just change out

586
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:18,720
your co2 before it totally depletes just

587
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,720
uh just in case because you know you've

588
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,360
got extra co2 in there you might as well

589
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,798
use it until it's gone so i i have the

590
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:29,279
redundancy in the on the co2 and the air

591
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,558
circulation currently i have a fan that

592
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,440
um

593
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:36,558
an oscillating fan and it's a small room

594
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,519
and it does really well at keeping

595
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:41,678
pretty good airflow in there i also have

596
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,720
a carbon filter

597
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,000
and it is they it pulls the air from

598
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,279
lower down

599
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,319
um and basically goes up it's it's a 10

600
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:55,279
inch pipe and then shoots that air

601
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:57,439
over the over the plants also so it's

602
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:00,158
kind of constantly stirring

603
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,798
but even with those two systems i find

604
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,679
that i think i could improve on air

605
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:07,119
circulation so my now my next upgrade is

606
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,798
i will have

607
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:13,439
two tubes going along the sides

608
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:14,879
on the floor and along the ceiling which

609
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,440
are connected

610
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,919
for the entire length of the box and

611
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,038
then i'll be circulating the air from

612
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,640
either

613
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:24,400
from the underneath

614
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,200
and and pulling the the cool air from

615
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,360
underneath bringing it up to the the

616
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,200
ceiling and um

617
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:33,199
sending it out that way across these

618
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,720
long pipes so it's not just blowing out

619
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,600
goes down the pipe and then comes out

620
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,720
all the holes in the pipe to give more

621
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,399
of a

622
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,120
trying to get more of a laminar flow

623
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,360
because they said with co2

624
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,719
for the plants to really benefit from it

625
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,519
doesn't need

626
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,839
a lot of agitation but it just needs

627
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:54,319
constant air movement and it's the

628
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,798
stagnant areas within the canopy that

629
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,558
become the problem uh it doesn't always

630
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:02,158
require just big fans blasting

631
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:04,879
everything just enough slow movement um

632
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,840
and and the plants uh supposedly fine

633
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,760
that's what that's what i've been

634
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,439
reading i always i do a lot of research

635
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,359
and then i come up with um try and come

636
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,679
up with a solution to see if that

637
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,759
actually helps and i'm still playing

638
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,200
with the idea of am i going to take the

639
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:18,798
air from the top

640
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,759
bring it down to the

641
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:22,319
floor

642
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,839
and let that you know hot air will that

643
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:25,678
rise

644
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,278
or would i be better off doing it the

645
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,960
other way around but

646
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:31,038
it's easy enough to flip the direction

647
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,400
of the fan and i'll be experimenting

648
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:34,400
with both ways and

649
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,559
figure out which which works best i

650
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,640
guess okay so that's co2 and air

651
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,558
circulation now for the

652
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,480
humidifier and dehumidifier that's

653
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,639
controlling your relative humidity and

654
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,159
also the heater and the air conditioner

655
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,000
that's controlling the temperature are

656
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,600
those pieces of equipment

657
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,839
inside the box or is it outside the box

658
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:56,480
everything is inside because everything

659
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:59,038
except for the co2 is inside the the

660
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,640
tanks for the co2 are external so that

661
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,599
and that gets uh pumped in i mean

662
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,880
um

663
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:09,918
all the electric work um is i have an

664
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,320
actual a sub panel on the outside and

665
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,520
then conduit that

666
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:18,079
goes into the surface mount boxes um for

667
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:21,359
the outlets and even those

668
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:24,240
are sealed um with foam

669
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,038
so that no air escapes

670
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,319
um

671
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:31,200
so yeah the dehumidifiers inside that's

672
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:34,240
also one currently i'm still using

673
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,480
your regular a regular dehumidifier and

674
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,880
i found that i um

675
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,839
when the the plants were smaller i did

676
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,360
better using a smaller

677
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:46,000
dehumidifier um so that it wasn't

678
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:47,678
cycling as much and then as they get

679
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,558
bigger i switched to a larger

680
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,840
dehumidifier and then if if when when

681
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:54,399
you can also the great thing with the

682
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,119
box it can also be used for for the you

683
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,360
know

684
00:25:55,119 --> 00:26:00,079
post post harvest and in the drying

685
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,798
phase and when it that happens then i

686
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:05,918
actually switched to a um desiccant

687
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:08,319
based dehumidifier which is

688
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,000
uh able to deal with the cooler

689
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:12,000
temperatures

690
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,679
it doesn't have the volume

691
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,839
but you can have a much cooler

692
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,880
temperature and remove

693
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,079
um

694
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:23,120
i found it's just a lot more efficient

695
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,720
at for power usage and it just works a

696
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:28,719
lot better so

697
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:33,200
i also am planning on incorporating a

698
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,720
larger built-in ducted dehumidifier

699
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,480
um

700
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,600
so that um

701
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,519
again to to give more control uh you can

702
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:44,319
get dehumidifiers these days that are

703
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:46,000
wi-fi based so you can see if it's

704
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:47,759
getting you know if your humidity is

705
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,558
getting too high you could remotely go

706
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:51,679
in and and lower that

707
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:53,678
and

708
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,278
again with the bigger systems there's

709
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,840
always um a

710
00:26:55,278 --> 00:27:00,480
control panel interface where you can

711
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:03,359
then take some electronics and i could

712
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,759
then take my computers my environment

713
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,798
controller and have those directly

714
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,879
control

715
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:11,278
the dehumidifier rather than just having

716
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,520
it constantly on and turning it on and

717
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:16,240
off with turning the the outlet on and

718
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:18,960
off which can be done but isn't really

719
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,240
an ideal way of of doing it gotcha we'll

720
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,919
get deeper into the environmental

721
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,079
controller and the

722
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,320
studio platform in a minute here last

723
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:29,439
thing i want to cover is can this system

724
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,798
be used for soil cocoa and or

725
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,640
hydroponics

726
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:35,918
yeah yeah because

727
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,000
really the the environment itself

728
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,880
which is just your your air temperature

729
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,599
humidity and co2 levels doesn't really

730
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,480
mind what method that you're using to

731
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:47,599
grow

732
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,720
uh aeroponics was my initial because i

733
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,959
thought

734
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,798
well it's a great way the roots get tons

735
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,200
of oxygen this way and i don't have to

736
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,319
deal with the media

737
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,440
at all

738
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,599
and so

739
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,960
that's one less thing to deal with

740
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:06,158
and i've had great success using

741
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,360
aeroponics um and it's it is kind of a

742
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:12,240
crazy way of growing because you you

743
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,918
missed the roots for for three seconds

744
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,240
every three minutes

745
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,278
and besides that they're just dangling

746
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,480
in

747
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,798
the dark

748
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,079
and you know this is high pressure

749
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:26,960
aeroponics this is not like your typical

750
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:29,519
cloner that has those little ray red

751
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,399
nozzles um just

752
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:35,278
spraying constantly this is a highly

753
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:36,798
atomized um mist

754
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:40,159
with um

755
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:42,839
special nozzles and it's that that it's

756
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:46,159
very fine and the mist

757
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:46,959
um the emitters are at the bottom and as

758
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,320
they

759
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,120
uh they fire they would they

760
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:56,480
they they circulate and it really swirls

761
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:59,119
around inside and it stays suspended for

762
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,278
a while before it even settles so it's a

763
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:03,599
great way of basically touching all the

764
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:07,119
different like all the the parts of the

765
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:10,079
route and getting great coverage um but

766
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:12,798
again i my last my last grow was in

767
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,798
cocoa which was just a departure i

768
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:17,119
wanted to try something different

769
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,960
because i didn't want these big chambers

770
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,038
and plants locked into a chamber i

771
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,960
wanted to have some flexibility of

772
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,319
plants and being able to actually move

773
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,200
them around

774
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:27,359
and

775
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,080
so i did a coco grow

776
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:33,439
and um my but my next grow is actually

777
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:35,038
going to be using a living soil and

778
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,679
i've got uh

779
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:40,558
a whole different a whole new system set

780
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,320
up that that i think is going to be um

781
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:45,200
interesting to see

782
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:48,240
you know what what i can produce

783
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,360
using uh using that setup gotcha that's

784
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,599
pretty cool that you built in the

785
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:52,959
flexibility to be able to use the

786
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:54,558
different types of mediums like that

787
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,079
right because they are

788
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,319
they are certainly different

789
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:00,079
in numerous ways

790
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,119
and you've incorporated the different

791
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,519
ways

792
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:05,439
within the plant studio platform so can

793
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:06,639
you talk to us about uh plant studio

794
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,360
platform

795
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,278
yeah that the platform this is the

796
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:14,000
almost the hardest part to understand of

797
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,919
the system because it's the

798
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,919
this is where it's like my my background

799
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:21,360
as a web developer

800
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:24,080
is um it's the computers and there are

801
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:25,439
basic there are three computers inside

802
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,319
the or

803
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,440
in

804
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:32,879
three computers for the gross system

805
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,080
one of the computers is controlling the

806
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,960
um

807
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:40,079
the lights the temperature the co2

808
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,240
humidity managing basically everything

809
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,839
above the you know it's that when do the

810
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,880
lights come on and off

811
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:46,879
um

812
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,159
and you know what's your nighttime

813
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,600
temperature

814
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,159
um

815
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:54,879
and uh what co2 levels you know turning

816
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,480
the co2 uh making sure the co2 doesn't

817
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,519
run at night time

818
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,759
um

819
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,480
so that that's the the environment

820
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:05,599
controller the reservoir controller

821
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,399
separate system totally non-dependent on

822
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:12,000
the environment controller

823
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:12,000
that has the

824
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,480
manages or monitors the ph

825
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:18,558
your ec

826
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,759
temperature the depth

827
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:24,720
um sensing all the different um

828
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,960
attributes of the of the reservoir and

829
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,839
the way it actually does that is

830
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,798
i have a circulation pump and it pumps

831
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,839
through

832
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:35,679
uh pvc pipe and that's where the sensors

833
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:38,398
are so instead of putting the sensors

834
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:41,360
actually in the reservoir itself

835
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,239
it circulates the reservoir

836
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,558
and

837
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,120
senses those

838
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:48,798
variables the values um

839
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:51,678
as it does so

840
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:55,038
and uh the idea was also

841
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,679
when i do um dosing and and things like

842
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,599
that it also serves as a the circulator

843
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,840
is also a mixing system

844
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:04,798
and it makes it easier to if you wanted

845
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:06,798
to switch something out um and also with

846
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,639
the reservoir level going up and down

847
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,480
how do you you know keeping your scent

848
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,960
making sure your senses are always in

849
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,159
the water is obviously important

850
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,558
so the um the system is able to fill and

851
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,880
drain itself automatically and this was

852
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:23,599
something that was this is one of those

853
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,278
ones where i just got tired of trying to

854
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,319
you know i didn't want to carry buckets

855
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:31,599
around and empty it that's the pain that

856
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:33,119
is hydroponics and um

857
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:34,000
so the

858
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,959
um

859
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,679
it can drain almost totally empty the

860
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,278
reservoir but also when it fills it i

861
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,759
can then specify

862
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:46,240
how much i want to put in and i actually

863
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:48,798
do everything based on liters instead of

864
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,798
gallons and it's not because i'm english

865
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:53,278
because i did grow up with you know i do

866
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:55,519
i do think of everything in gallons but

867
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:56,720
when it comes to dosing

868
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,798
everything seems to be done in

869
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,399
milliliters i mean sometimes you would

870
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:03,200
get those tablespoons or you guys a

871
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:04,479
tablespoon is that a teaspoon and it get

872
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,558
you know but

873
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,558
now it's all milliliters and you know

874
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:11,038
liters a thousand liters so it gives you

875
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:13,839
a better idea of proportions

876
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:16,480
um but again it's been great that when i

877
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:19,439
go to fill it up 25 gallons is maybe

878
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,399
close to about 80 liters or something

879
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,558
like that so i just say 80 liters

880
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:27,439
it just puts that water in and then i go

881
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:29,918
and dose from there and so you know the

882
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,759
dosing side of the reservoir controller

883
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,120
which again is this little computer

884
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,398
controls

885
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:37,119
i have five

886
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:39,199
pumps and they you can choose whatever

887
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:42,479
liquid you want to

888
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,000
mix in and typically you'd have your

889
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,278
a and b

890
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,558
multi-part nutrient and then maybe some

891
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:52,398
micro or i have a cal mag

892
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:53,839
and then you'd have one of them would be

893
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:56,639
a ph

894
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:59,439
um either increase or decrease you

895
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,200
typically don't need both you'll find

896
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,278
that you got a drift in one dir you know

897
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,240
you you want to correct one direction

898
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:06,960
only

899
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,960
so you know one of them is a ph

900
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,079
adjuster and the other or all

901
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:15,280
nutrients or additive um

902
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,839
based and those inject

903
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,720
in line with that circulator so after it

904
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:22,159
goes by your temperature your ph and

905
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,078
your ec

906
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,760
there is and you'll see

907
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,200
in the video it's the the clear acrylic

908
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,159
piece of pipe

909
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,638
the

910
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,480
the drops going in that's dropping into

911
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,320
the circulation

912
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,199
of the um

913
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,039
of

914
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,480
where the you know where the sensors are

915
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:41,199
basically

916
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,119
so

917
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:46,239
that's the the

918
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,519
um you know the the reservoir controller

919
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:51,598
and um

920
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:54,398
what's nice is with the computer part of

921
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,240
it then is like i can then specify a

922
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:58,960
program and saying all right

923
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:01,118
at this time empty the reservoir put

924
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,240
this many liters into it

925
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:06,880
dose this much into it of a

926
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:10,399
wait until you see that the ppms has

927
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,039
stabilized so that you know that it's

928
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:17,358
well mixed and then once you see that

929
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:20,880
the the ec has uh stabilized then going

930
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:22,719
to your next uh your b nutrient and then

931
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,559
once that's stabilized you could specify

932
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:27,439
time or say let it see if it's

933
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:30,320
stabilized before doing the next one and

934
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,400
then it goes along and then with the ph

935
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,559
again you can i

936
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,200
a lot of it is just algorithms different

937
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,719
algorithms for ph

938
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:41,279
and um

939
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:43,358
but the whole thing is basically

940
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,760
set my reservoir up

941
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:46,719
so that it's ready then to feed the

942
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,760
plants

943
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:51,598
so that's the reservoir controller

944
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,320
totally independent of the environment

945
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,160
controller but then for the human side

946
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,079
of things now that that's the control

947
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:00,559
it's like the human interface that's

948
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,039
where you can manage its base uh pretty

949
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:06,639
basic i can go in and turn the lights on

950
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:07,920
turn the lights off um with the you know

951
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:11,118
and i could

952
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,880
turn the fans on circulation pumps and

953
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,160
what have you

954
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,960
um so that's the that computers to

955
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:20,639
control it but then also to monitor it

956
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,800
because

957
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:26,719
all this information every single minute

958
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,079
the system reads

959
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:30,879
every value

960
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,359
and so in a day i'm getting about 40 000

961
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,358
data points at every minute what is the

962
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,199
temperature what's the ec what's the air

963
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:39,679
temperature what's the co2 level what's

964
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,118
the depth of the reservoir

965
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,719
what's the the

966
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,559
air conditioner or the the watts of the

967
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:49,439
dehumidifier because i track the power

968
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:51,279
usage of things like the dehumidifier

969
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,599
because that enables me to see if i've

970
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,079
sized it correctly if i see that thing

971
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,119
is peaked and running all the time then

972
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,960
you're going to need a bigger

973
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,200
dehumidifier

974
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,039
or it's set up incorrectly where it's

975
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,039
short cycling because

976
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:08,320
uh something's blowing on it or it's

977
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:10,719
it's just not moving the air properly so

978
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,920
the the human interface part

979
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:14,559
is

980
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,639
again it's gathering the data but also

981
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:19,199
it's what and again you can see in the

982
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:22,879
video it shows that the graphs it's what

983
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:24,879
i'll put up in my bedroom up on the tv

984
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,039
and i'll be you know live streaming you

985
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,079
know i have here's exactly showing you

986
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:32,159
know gauges what what my current ph is

987
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,560
and if it gets too high

988
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:36,319
it can send off an alert but it also

989
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,559
changes so i have everything kind of

990
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:42,240
green when things start going red that's

991
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:46,000
a problem so um also with this human

992
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:48,559
interface component um computer

993
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,559
it allows me to go back at any point in

994
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:53,679
time of the grow

995
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:55,838
and see exactly at that stage

996
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:59,279
what that environment was

997
00:37:55,838 --> 00:38:02,239
so it gives me history for analysis so

998
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,240
every grow i have all that information

999
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,159
it might seem overkill to say well you

1000
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:09,039
don't need to do it every minute

1001
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,960
but with some of these systems and these

1002
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,320
time series databases and things that

1003
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,199
they have out there

1004
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,039
it's

1005
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:17,279
it's not that much information it's not

1006
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:19,759
a hide a 4k video that's streaming it's

1007
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,119
got more bandwidth in in probably a

1008
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,359
minute than you'd you'd have in an

1009
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,240
entire grow so

1010
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:26,719
um

1011
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:30,159
if you can gather that information why

1012
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:32,639
not have it and again it's very easy to

1013
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:35,199
then go back and with the you know with

1014
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,239
a mouse i can just select a certain time

1015
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,480
span

1016
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:41,838
and it shows me all

1017
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,199
the stage all the um the readings from

1018
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:45,119
all the sensors

1019
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,838
at that point in time and i think it's

1020
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,920
just a a really useful thing to have so

1021
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:51,199
that's really what people and i spend my

1022
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,599
most time

1023
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:56,239
using is the human interface the other

1024
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,880
things just do their job i'm not that i

1025
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:03,679
try and you know they they manage the

1026
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,680
system gotcha you uncovered a lot there

1027
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,039
so

1028
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,800
you have a lot of control with this

1029
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:10,800
plant studio platform i mean guys check

1030
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,640
out the video that is in the link in the

1031
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,000
description on the website you'll see

1032
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:15,598
exactly what we're talking about what

1033
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,079
exactly what simon just explained with

1034
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,480
the graphs and so on and so forth now

1035
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,880
for the reservoir controller you said

1036
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,358
that's controlled on one computer and it

1037
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,640
really sounds just so hands-off i know a

1038
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:28,239
lot of people are probably listening to

1039
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:29,838
this and their their ears are really

1040
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:33,039
perking up because

1041
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:34,078
it completely automates feeding entirely

1042
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,679
and you can have several different

1043
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,720
bottles hooked up to this

1044
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:40,480
and it can dose and it can wait

1045
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:42,959
for things to be stable then it could do

1046
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,559
the next dose and then wait and it's

1047
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,119
just i've never

1048
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:48,320
seen this level of automation before

1049
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,358
you know particularly on the homegrown

1050
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,680
side of things i know there are some

1051
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:53,358
commercial operations that are automated

1052
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:55,598
i don't know how automated they are but

1053
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:56,559
for the most part the fact that you can

1054
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,000
actually

1055
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:59,759
control the water levels right your

1056
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,079
hands off on the water level your hands

1057
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,520
off on dosing nutrients your hands off

1058
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,318
on ph

1059
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:05,759
right

1060
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,679
and then you're even hands off when it

1061
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,800
comes to your environment completely

1062
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:10,719
because you have an environmental

1063
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,960
controller i was going to ask you where

1064
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:16,559
the probes are located within the space

1065
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,039
but you have a you have basically a

1066
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:20,719
controller of probes that hook up to the

1067
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:23,279
environmental controller that's going to

1068
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,399
automatically turn on and off your

1069
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,920
humidifier

1070
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,000
dehumidifier

1071
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,920
air conditioner heater in order to

1072
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,440
control those those measurements right

1073
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,079
those variables

1074
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,920
where is the the probes located for like

1075
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,640
co2 and temp and

1076
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,440
that's the one that is hanging i have

1077
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:43,358
conduit that goes uh from the en

1078
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,200
environment controller

1079
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:47,519
which is it's just to the left of the

1080
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:48,639
the wall mounted mini split

1081
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:51,039
and

1082
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:52,400
it basically goes along the ceiling

1083
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:54,559
right into the middle

1084
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,358
of the grow area

1085
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:58,000
so

1086
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:59,598
as i uh basically

1087
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,079
that's not automated the raising and

1088
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,838
lowering of that that sensor but that

1089
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,400
sensor is the temperature humidity and

1090
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,199
co2 sensor on on

1091
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,519
um

1092
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:12,799
on a wire basically

1093
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:15,599
so that is hardwired to the environment

1094
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,519
controller itself gotcha and then one

1095
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,519
other piece which i don't i think you

1096
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:20,880
might have briefly covered it is it's

1097
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,800
shown in the video

1098
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,280
is it automatically is calculating your

1099
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,760
energy consumption and putting a dollar

1100
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,440
sign to it right so it's telling you

1101
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,280
literally it's having a water how much

1102
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,720
water you're using putting a dollar

1103
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,760
amount to it how much you're spending

1104
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,159
for water

1105
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,000
nutrients dollar amount electricity

1106
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:40,078
consumption dollar amount

1107
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,920
so you're getting down to that granular

1108
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,560
level that will vary based obviously on

1109
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:48,400
where you live in in the new england

1110
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:50,318
water here is is pretty cheap um

1111
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,440
california i know that's that's a

1112
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:57,199
different story and the the electricity

1113
00:41:53,440 --> 00:42:01,280
is the the biggest

1114
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:05,919
resource uh i do try i track the the

1115
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:08,560
electric the co2 usage the water and the

1116
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,358
nutrients because you know how many

1117
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:14,880
milliliters you put in of each nutrient

1118
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:16,559
i also have a database saying this is

1119
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,400
the nutrient i got

1120
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:21,759
i spent this much for the nutrient and

1121
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,599
it has this many milliliters in it so i

1122
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,000
know on a per milliliter how much is

1123
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,039
that nutrient cost on a per milliliter

1124
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,920
basis

1125
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:32,639
so when i feed it i know how much that

1126
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,960
that feeding even cost uh you know my

1127
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:37,199
electrici my electric cost

1128
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,679
when it is really cranking for me here

1129
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:42,879
is about five dollars a day

1130
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:46,159
is my is my cost and by having a sealed

1131
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,400
room the ac and the dehumidifier are

1132
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:50,799
kind of close to half

1133
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,440
the other half of the lights

1134
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,680
so that is the price that you pay

1135
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,039
i have been thinking about you know ways

1136
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:01,960
of you know using the winter uh the cold

1137
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:04,800
outside can i use that as a means of

1138
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:07,199
dehumidifying or cooling without

1139
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,079
directly bringing that air in using some

1140
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:12,639
kind of a chiller system and and making

1141
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,760
it more efficient

1142
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:16,000
however

1143
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,480
for simplicity's sake having everything

1144
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,039
in the room just um is definitely the

1145
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,880
way to start um in a sealed room i think

1146
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:24,838
it's a good way of starting you could

1147
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,480
always go to air

1148
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:30,559
exchange if um if it makes sense if the

1149
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,599
environment is conducive

1150
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:34,239
to that

1151
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,920
but again i'm about knowing that it's

1152
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:37,439
totally controlled and not being able to

1153
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,599
have an excuse and saying well that was

1154
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,400
a hot day and all the humidity has been

1155
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:46,640
killing me i don't i you know this this

1156
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:49,119
box could be run in any environment um

1157
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:51,679
as long as the ambient environment where

1158
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,599
the reservoir is obviously doesn't get

1159
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,039
below freezing you know i can i have a

1160
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,079
heater i have a chiller for the

1161
00:43:55,039 --> 00:44:01,279
reservoir which is outside of the

1162
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,760
uh the studio box itself

1163
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,760
so that that um

1164
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,880
that's something that again i'm

1165
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,000
constantly

1166
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:13,440
trying to improve the efficiency

1167
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,000
of the resources used for growing

1168
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,280
and you know that's why i'm also

1169
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,880
uh excited to try out the soil doing a

1170
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,040
soil grow next

1171
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,838
because um you know

1172
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:29,599
my last grow i i

1173
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:30,559
decided to put each plant on a scale

1174
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,318
and

1175
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:34,559
this is going to ask you about next is

1176
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:35,920
if we could talk about the scale side of

1177
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:38,880
things that's pretty mind-blowing as

1178
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,039
well yeah so and that that's even

1179
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,680
changed from from

1180
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:46,239
that grow until now

1181
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:49,358
initially the

1182
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:50,799
the idea was how do i you know when to

1183
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:52,880
water plants a lot of people would say

1184
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,519
well you you pick them up and you you

1185
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,920
get a sense of how you know the weight

1186
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:59,280
and um gives you a better sense than

1187
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,838
just trying to stick your finger in the

1188
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,640
top and feeling how dry the soil is

1189
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:05,838
and

1190
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:08,799
so i built six scales

1191
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:11,279
which are all wi-fi enabled or part of

1192
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,560
the system and every minute they report

1193
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,079
their weight

1194
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:15,599
so when i

1195
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,880
fertigate

1196
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:21,200
i was using these covers

1197
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,119
that have two misters in them and it

1198
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:24,159
would water all the plants at the same

1199
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,119
time

1200
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:28,000
and

1201
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,200
it worked great in the beginning

1202
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,440
but

1203
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:33,838
and and the nice thing is i could see

1204
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,519
also by doing that that all the plants

1205
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:37,440
were actually getting water if one of

1206
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:39,440
them were to clog i've never had a

1207
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,200
clogging issue you really shouldn't

1208
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,200
actually have a clogging issue if you

1209
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:45,519
always have a pre-filter by the way for

1210
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:48,559
your pump i'd always recommend you have

1211
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:50,079
to put a pre-filter on the pump

1212
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:53,279
that really almost

1213
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:55,039
mitigates um clogging issues

1214
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,839
and um

1215
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:57,759
so

1216
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:59,358
all the plants i could see would be

1217
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,839
getting

1218
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:04,239
liter a few a couple liters when that

1219
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:05,838
when they were smaller and it was very

1220
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:08,078
accurate they all got the same amount

1221
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:09,838
they their weight would all increase but

1222
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,160
then as one plant would

1223
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:14,400
um overtake and have different water

1224
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:15,920
requirements of the other now i'm like

1225
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,160
well i don't want to give them all the

1226
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,159
same amount of water one needs more than

1227
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:22,480
the other so i'd end up taking some of

1228
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:24,960
the misters and i'd say hey give it to

1229
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,800
this guy so he gets extra and he gets

1230
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,800
one less because there's two misters per

1231
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,560
plant but now you're going away from the

1232
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,280
whole automation thing

1233
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:36,400
so my latest setup that i actually

1234
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,920
haven't run yet is a

1235
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,639
manifold it's like an irrigation

1236
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:44,880
manifold but um

1237
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:48,318
but it's also why it's controlled by the

1238
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,640
reservoir controller that can say

1239
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:55,119
send water only to this plant

1240
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:57,679
so now i can water each individual plant

1241
00:46:55,119 --> 00:47:00,240
um separately

1242
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:01,199
and what that's going to allow for

1243
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:02,559
is

1244
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,799
you know you can try different

1245
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:06,880
experiments i could let some plants if

1246
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,318
they're all cloned then that would be

1247
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,039
almost ideal because you could really

1248
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:12,800
then understand different watering

1249
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:16,159
patterns and how they affect those

1250
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:18,000
plants do you want to do a deep watering

1251
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,639
less frequently

1252
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,760
small watering more frequently

1253
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:24,078
and

1254
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,000
the other part is that also because it

1255
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:28,240
ties into the reservoir

1256
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,119
i could then potentially

1257
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:31,519
um

1258
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,358
mix in the reservoir

1259
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:35,920
a different mix

1260
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:37,440
potentially for each plant so i could

1261
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,358
put in

1262
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,200
and i'm actually gonna have to downsize

1263
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:43,358
the reservoir a little bit if i'm doing

1264
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:46,159
on an individual plant basis

1265
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:48,639
but by with a smaller reservoir i can

1266
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:49,920
then mix up some nutrients send it to

1267
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:52,400
plan a

1268
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,200
and then i can flush that out or you

1269
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,800
know empty empty um you know give it all

1270
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:58,719
everything that's in the reservoir empty

1271
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,240
it out and then

1272
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:03,279
for the next plant

1273
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:05,358
give it a different nutrient and maybe a

1274
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,240
different quantity so again you could

1275
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:11,279
then set up different

1276
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:13,519
uh tests experiments for all these

1277
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,839
different plants and that to me is a

1278
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:18,079
great way of doing your uh phenotype

1279
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:20,639
hunting because you obviously you know

1280
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:22,880
you start with your genetics but

1281
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:24,558
different

1282
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,880
nutrients

1283
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,760
what works for some might not work for

1284
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,240
others

1285
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,559
and this way i think it's a good way of

1286
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:33,679
automating staying consistent because i

1287
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,359
think a lot of people when you're

1288
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:37,279
growing they go well i'm not going to

1289
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:40,078
mix up a different batch for each

1290
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,400
different plan but if it's automated

1291
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,318
it doesn't then let the machine do the

1292
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,519
work you don't you just sit and watch

1293
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:49,279
and get an idea of you know what effect

1294
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:51,838
that has that's still coming down to the

1295
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:54,880
person to look at the plants to see if

1296
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:56,558
it's a happy plant or not and um to see

1297
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,160
what kind of results you get and that to

1298
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,400
me as far as the gardening that that

1299
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:01,279
seems like that's the the enjoyable part

1300
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,519
of it

1301
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,119
that's so cool that's really really cool

1302
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:07,759
so the last piece i wanted to have you

1303
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:10,480
talk about which is really fascinating

1304
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,079
is the imaging computer you have that

1305
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,440
inspects the plant health can you talk

1306
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,318
to us about that

1307
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,880
yeah so that's actually a separate

1308
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:21,199
computer it's uh it's really a small

1309
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,720
computer that i had hooked up to an old

1310
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:27,519
slr that that i had and um you know the

1311
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:29,439
they just you want a a good camera with

1312
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:31,358
a good lens is gonna take much better

1313
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,159
pictures and um

1314
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:35,119
so

1315
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:36,318
it's set up so that every 10 minutes of

1316
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,480
the plant

1317
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:40,400
plan of the plant's life

1318
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,719
they have their picture taken

1319
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,440
and the idea is that it only takes their

1320
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:48,399
picture but it also stores it

1321
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,200
on that monitoring computer

1322
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,318
so

1323
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:54,799
every at any point in time not only

1324
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:58,639
could i go back and say what was i

1325
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:01,280
feeding or what what was the ec and ph

1326
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:02,239
but you can also see how the plants

1327
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,000
looked

1328
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:05,439
and the thing that i actually found that

1329
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,838
i mean originally i did it because i

1330
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,920
thought it was just kind of cool i i was

1331
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:12,639
like everyone likes a time lapse i don't

1332
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,159
know if you've seen the um amazing fungi

1333
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:16,318
uh

1334
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:20,399
showing on netflix and all those time

1335
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:22,800
lapses are just uh mesmerizing yeah and

1336
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:26,400
the the cool thing is i think

1337
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:28,800
when you feed your plants

1338
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,599
you can't see how they're doing at that

1339
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,519
point of that how they're responding

1340
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,519
but if you put it in a time lapse and

1341
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:38,079
you get to look at them

1342
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:40,239
over that even over one day you know you

1343
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,440
know you've got your six pictures an

1344
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:44,558
hour

1345
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,639
and in a day you get to see

1346
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,559
did they seem to respond well or not

1347
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:51,598
because people seem to have a good sense

1348
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,519
of a happy or an unhappy plan and

1349
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,359
definitely seeing the growth

1350
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:57,920
you can watch it within one day it's

1351
00:50:55,358 --> 00:51:00,719
pretty easy to see growth

1352
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,440
just even at a 10 minute interval

1353
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:05,199
pictures so again it's partly for i

1354
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,000
thought it was cool

1355
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:10,078
but i found it really useful so then i i

1356
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,960
am able to run a script and at the end

1357
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:15,359
of the day it can it can just generate

1358
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,838
that day's time lapse or i could say

1359
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:20,880
give me over the last three days or from

1360
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:24,078
the beginning of the grow until now so i

1361
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,920
watch time lapses all the time just to

1362
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,519
get a feel for the plants and you know

1363
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,800
just because it's kind of cool to watch

1364
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:30,880
also i guess

1365
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,880
yeah that is really cool i don't do as

1366
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,039
many time lapses as i should a lot of

1367
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,720
people like to see the time lapses in in

1368
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,920
videos and i don't do many of them i've

1369
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,039
only done a handful of them i know

1370
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,280
there's a lot of content creators that

1371
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:43,358
do a lot of time lapses but that's

1372
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,359
really cool that you're able to add that

1373
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:46,799
into your automated system and you know

1374
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:48,719
for planned health purposes so you can

1375
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,800
see how well your yeah is doing as far

1376
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:53,519
as the health of the plan yeah that the

1377
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,318
other part is um i should have mentioned

1378
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:56,880
is

1379
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:59,119
it's also a great way of

1380
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,519
again if you have a high enough res

1381
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:05,280
picture being able to take something and

1382
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:08,000
then maybe identifying

1383
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:11,040
plant issues that you're having

1384
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,119
deficiencies uh over watering is that

1385
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:14,800
underwatering like sometimes you can

1386
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,400
look at a plant and you get a sense of

1387
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,880
that so

1388
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,280
that's also something i continue to grow

1389
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,318
i do want to get it so that i can

1390
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:27,119
getting closer on the individual leaves

1391
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:28,960
so that you can start to identify

1392
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,920
what you know what might be going on

1393
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:34,639
with the plant itself uh from a health

1394
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:37,838
standpoint so that's that's the other

1395
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:39,679
aspect i think is useful uh ideally i'd

1396
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:42,239
love to tie it into some kind of a

1397
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:44,159
computer vision where the system can

1398
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:45,838
kind of look and go

1399
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:48,399
that looks like you've got a calcium

1400
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:50,078
deficiency that looks like that's um

1401
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,079
you know it's been over watered or

1402
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,839
underwatered or that whatever the

1403
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:56,640
problem may may be

1404
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:58,000
and um again i i know some people might

1405
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:59,679
say well you know that's going to take

1406
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,559
an expert a person

1407
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:05,118
in order to be able to identify that but

1408
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,720
people have to realize too that with the

1409
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:10,160
computer vision

1410
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:11,679
a lot of that stuff and the ai is it is

1411
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:13,199
people training

1412
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:15,199
those systems

1413
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:17,919
so it's really is a person

1414
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:19,759
takes pictures and they say

1415
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,079
this is this problem and this looks like

1416
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,000
that problem and after you've given the

1417
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:27,280
machine enough of those

1418
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,880
it gets better identifying it itself so

1419
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,200
then everyone doesn't have to be an

1420
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,519
expert on that you can have experts who

1421
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:34,480
have identified these issues and then

1422
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:37,199
that

1423
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:39,838
gets then everyone could have the power

1424
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:41,838
of those expert opinions

1425
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:44,480
via computer vision without a person

1426
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:47,199
actually looking them personally at

1427
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:49,599
their plants so i do think that the

1428
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:53,598
ai and the machine learning stuff

1429
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:55,200
is is a fascinating and definitely a um

1430
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,359
we'll definitely be seeing a lot more of

1431
00:53:55,199 --> 00:54:00,159
that um and it's it's already been done

1432
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:02,318
quite a bit also nice nice

1433
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:03,759
so when will this plant studio be

1434
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:06,558
available and you know how much does

1435
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:10,079
something like this cost

1436
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:13,119
it's it's not currently available um

1437
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:15,200
unfortunately um it it and

1438
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,680
it's something that

1439
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:20,318
it's difficult because it requires it's

1440
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:23,199
a large

1441
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:26,558
box it's a large machine but also

1442
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:28,639
requires um an electrician

1443
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,480
to bring in um

1444
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:32,239
you know a circuit

1445
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,760
i have a

1446
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:38,399
30 amp 240 volt

1447
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,799
circuit going to a sub panel

1448
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,400
and again i'm not an electrician so i

1449
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:44,798
have to have an electrician hook that up

1450
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:47,200
if you have the mini split depending on

1451
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:49,519
the distance that you're running it

1452
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:51,439
you might have to you you have to have

1453
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:54,880
someone come in who has

1454
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:57,119
access who can charge it with the um

1455
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,838
required refrigerant

1456
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:02,000
to get that going so it's it's kind of

1457
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:03,759
like you know putting an addition on a

1458
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,400
house or something you need like these

1459
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,240
these subs to the who can all do their

1460
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,280
part um

1461
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:13,039
you know to to get everything going um

1462
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,400
it's not to say i wouldn't like to get

1463
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:17,759
to that point

1464
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:20,480
um and that is also why i've made a lot

1465
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,520
of the like the the reservoir controller

1466
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,480
itself

1467
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:27,838
i made i didn't want to cut out with

1468
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,798
wood so i actually got a cnc machine

1469
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:33,199
learned to use a cnc machine designed it

1470
00:55:30,798 --> 00:55:34,960
had the cnc cut all the parts out and

1471
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:37,919
then put it together

1472
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:40,720
so it was a perfect fit so it works well

1473
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,200
for replication i've never replicated it

1474
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:45,919
again using that yet i've still because

1475
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:47,598
i i've been getting into the details of

1476
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,960
the software and stuff

1477
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,240
but um

1478
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,559
you know and it

1479
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:54,959
it's it'd be pretty expensive because a

1480
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:57,440
lot of the components that i use are

1481
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,880
really good but one thing you have to

1482
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,200
keep in mind is

1483
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:04,318
you need good sensors to get good data

1484
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:06,719
if your ph sensor is not accurate

1485
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:10,798
it's garbage in garbage out

1486
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:11,838
so you you need good quality information

1487
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:14,318
and

1488
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:16,880
if you want the efficiency of

1489
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:18,480
the air conditioning you need something

1490
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,119
that's going to be have a high seer

1491
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,400
rating it'll cost you less to run it

1492
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,880
you could do it

1493
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:27,440
less expensive units and stuff

1494
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,039
so um i know it's not exactly answering

1495
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,200
your question

1496
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:33,279
but it is something that i i do think

1497
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:35,439
about and i um

1498
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,280
i you know i am um

1499
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,358
definitely definitely working on it for

1500
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,359
sure gotcha yeah even if it was just

1501
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:43,358
individual components you know whether

1502
00:56:41,358 --> 00:56:45,199
it be the controllers or even like the

1503
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:47,039
software right i'm sure people would

1504
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:49,519
loved i'm sure people are listening to

1505
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:51,759
salivating how the software is

1506
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:53,519
and how uh you know automated it can be

1507
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,359
you know just if it was a plug-and-play

1508
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:56,719
version where you could attach your own

1509
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:58,558
equipment that you have in your growth

1510
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:00,879
space to the software i think that would

1511
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:03,359
be extremely beneficial so hope to see

1512
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,880
something like that in the future

1513
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:06,480
so wrapping things up how can the

1514
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,920
listeners find you and what do you have

1515
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,960

people like minded people out there or

1528
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:44,159
even people who could compliment what i

1529
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,760
do i i don't consider myself

1530
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:48,639
to have a green thumb

1531
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:51,520
i am able to automate and i i've learned

1532
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:54,159
a lot from youtube and uh listening to

1533
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:57,280
shows like yours as far as the the more

1534
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:59,920
the cultivation side of things but i you

1535
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,839
know my angle and my what i bring really

1536
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,240
is the the systems and the the

1537
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:05,679
automation to it so

1538
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:08,719
you know i'm

1539
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:11,598
basically just i also want to help

1540
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:13,679
people understand that automation

1541
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:15,838
it seems complicated

1542
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:18,639
and some people go well it's also prone

1543
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:20,639
to error and if that doesn't work then

1544
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:22,639
then it's gonna you know then then

1545
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:25,679
what's to happen to my grow

1546
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:29,279
but i think most people will find that

1547
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:31,279
is there to help you to enable you

1548
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,640
and to do a lot of the things that you

1549
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,720
don't want to do

1550
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:36,798
you know i'd say don't carry a bucket of

1551
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:39,118
water from one to another even something

1552
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:40,719
as simple like using something like um

1553
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,318
some of these diaphragm pumps you can

1554
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:45,039
get for 50 bucks

1555
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:47,679
that has a built-in pressure switch so

1556
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:50,159
you can stick a hose in a bucket

1557
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:52,000
and it self primes it pumps the water

1558
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:53,679
and sends it to where you want to be use

1559
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,960
something like that don't don't make it

1560
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:58,000
hard on yourself

1561
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:00,798
so use some of the stuff out there

1562
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,960
make your and enjoy it more i would

1563
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:05,838
start at least monitor and get get an

1564
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,798
inexpensive camera to look at your your

1565
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:09,838
grow

1566
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:12,239
and you could even pan over to a

1567
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:13,838
temperature and humidity sensor that's

1568
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:16,078
just a standalone sitting there and now

1569
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:19,039
you can remotely see it and you can get

1570
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:21,119
these cameras for like 35 bucks that can

1571
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:22,798
pan and tilt and they want you to get

1572
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:24,480
the subscription for it but if you're

1573
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:25,838
just doing a live view to check on your

1574
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,280
plants and see what the current

1575
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:29,679
environment is

1576
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:32,640
why not do that it's a very inexpensive

1577
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:34,399
way of being able to kind of

1578
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:37,039
have some remote

1579
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:39,119
access to your grow and to give you some

1580
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:41,519
hopefully comfort that that everything's

1581
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:42,480
going well so you know that that would

1582
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:45,920
be my

1583
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:48,639
