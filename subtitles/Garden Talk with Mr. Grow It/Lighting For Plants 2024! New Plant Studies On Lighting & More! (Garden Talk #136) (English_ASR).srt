00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,519
welcome to the Garden Talk podcast where

2
00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:08,359
we interview Growers from all over the

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,079
world both beginners and experts seeking

4
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:12,000
to learn more about what they know about

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,519
gardening and how they do things in

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,679
their Garden hey what's up everybody for

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,600
those of you that don't know me my name

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,560
is Chris aka Mr Grow and you're tuned in

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,320
to the Garden Talk podcast this episode

10
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,799
number

11
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,039
136 in this episode I interview Shane

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,278
from migro he was on the podcast once

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,880
before episode number 33 back in 2021

14
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,719
where he talked all about LED grow

15
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,640
lights we will continue to talk about

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,640
lighting in this episode diving into

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,399
topics such as Ender canopy lighting DLI

18
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,159
like quantity instead of quality and so

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,120
much more these podcast episodes are

20
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,078
broken up into short clips and they get

21
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:48,159
placed on their own dedicated YouTube

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,119
channel called Garden talk Clips I also

23
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,959
have a gardening Channel where I show

24
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,280
the plants that I grow both of those

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,399
channels will be linked down in the

26
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,239
YouTube description section below one of

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,960
my goals for this podcast is to bring

28
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,280
free information about gardening to the

29
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,160
general public that being said i' like

back and I'm joined with Shane from

57
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,840
migro Led how you doing today hey Chris

58
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,318
doing very well thank you thanks for

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,439
coming back onto the podcast I had to

60
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,919
look it up you were on the podcast in

61
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:20,239
2021 so several years ago that was

62
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:23,759
episode 33 and

63
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,239
110,000 views on that episode it was

64
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,039
incredible and I remember we had so many

65
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,920
good topics we talked about a whole

66
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:31,039
bunch of different things that were

67
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:32,878
lighting related we talked about grow

68
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,840
light testing the different colors in

69
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:38,239
the light spectrum diodes drivers and so

70
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,560
much more so if you are tuning into this

71
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,400
podcast episode and miss that episode

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,120
highly recommend you go back to that

73
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,920
episode at some point maybe after you're

74
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,400
listening to this one go back to that

75
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,199
one tune into it and there's a lot to be

76
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,640
learned there and I'll link it down in

77
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:53,079
the YouTube description section below

78
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,119
like I usually do this episode we're

79
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,599
going to get into a variety of topics

80
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,200
mostly lighting based more I would say

81
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,878
on the intermediate or advanced side of

82
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:04,598
things but I'm sure that beginners will

83
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,199
be able to grasp on some of these things

84
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:08,199
and they'll have some takeaways as well

85
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:10,598
so figured I'd mention that before we

86
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,039
get started also I wanted to ask you if

87
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:13,560
you can introduce yourself for those

88
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:15,519
that didn't catch the first episode we

89
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,319
did together yeah sure so my name is

90
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:22,640
Shane uh own a company called migro and

91
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:25,079
uh predominantly make and sell LED grow

92
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,919
lights uh but also run a channel called

93
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,599
migro across uh YouTube Instagram

94
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:34,598
Facebook Tik Tok and and uh yeah tried

95
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:37,119
to cover all TP all topics related to

96
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:39,438
grow lighting tried to do kind of a

97
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,640
scientific informative Channel with lots

98
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:45,079
of tips and howtos and tests and

99
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,598
comparisons and all that kind of stuff

100
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,560
and um yeah I've been doing it for seven

101
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:51,079
or eight years now so just getting to

102
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,360
find my feet yeah you do been doing a

103
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,200
great job over several years now and I

104
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,400
see that plaque behind you that means

105
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,878
you must have passed 100,000 subscribers

106
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,680
congratulations I did I did thank you

107
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,120
that's awesome all right let's dive into

108
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,879
some topics uh one of the topics that I

109
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,879
want to start with is kind of a Hot

110
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,399
Topic here intra canopy lighting it's

111
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,239
becoming more and more popular these

112
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,840
days some say it's worth it While others

113
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,079
say it's a waste of energy and money

114
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,199
what is in keny lighting and what is

115
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,799
your overall thoughts on it so yeah so

116
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,160
our typical sort of traditional lighting

117
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:26,719
is from above and um so you'd have your

118
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,320
grow tent uh you'd have multiple plants

119
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:35,120
in your tent and typically you Tred to

120
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:37,959
grow a a plane of of of green um sea of

121
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,240
green so that it'll it'll like a solar

122
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:43,239
panel it'll capture all the photons from

123
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,759
the light source and of course convert

124
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:49,439
it into um into energy and into growth

125
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,800
what's happening now is that I suppose

126
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,519
the boundaries are starting to be pushed

127
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,918
in terms of how much light the plants

128
00:04:53,519 --> 00:05:00,599
can take and to push that to its extreme

129
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,000
people are starting to use intra canopy

130
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,639
lighting which would be lighting that

131
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,319
would be positioned either down the side

132
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,360
or underneath the plants and basically

133
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:13,120
lighting it from below or from the side

134
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,199
and the theory is that you can get more

135
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,639
growth out of the same square footage uh

136
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,759
so you can increase your your yield per

137
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,840
square foot by adding additional

138
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,280
lighting um underneath the that's the

139
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:27,359
side as they say okay and would you say

140
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,359
it's worth it to do that or would you

141
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,919
say it's not really worth it you don't

142
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,680
really much of a gain from it so well I

143
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:36,799
just going to take one small step back

144
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,959
in that that other research has been

145
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,400
showing recently that plants can absorb

146
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:44,120
more light than we previously thought in

147
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:49,000
particular medicinal

148
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,840
herbs um so typically you know right way

149
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,279
back when we were growing with HPS we

150
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:57,560
would have been delivering somewhere

151
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,918
around 5 to 600 micromols of uh Power uh

152
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:05,918
that's a measure of of light intensity

153
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:08,198
that plants can use um and with the the

154
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,079
uh increased usage of LEDs and in

155
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,919
particular the reduced heat from LEDs

156
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,038
we're kind of able to put a lot more

157
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:17,000
light into grow areas now without the

158
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,399
environment suffering and people have

159
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,439
been pushing that up to about 800 or 900

160
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,638
micro moles so nearly twice as much and

161
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,399
that's over the last three or four years

162
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,199
and I had the most recent sort of study

163
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:33,079
and and um practice uh by commercial

164
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,919
Growers and and and people pushing the

165
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:38,240
um the the the the performance of the

166
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,639
plants I found that you can comfortably

167
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,280
go up to about 12200 micromoles on a

168
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,360
12-hour cycle which is about you know

169
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:48,000
it's nearly 50% more again um so about

170
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,560
two and a half times what we used to

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,560
only five or six years ago and one way

172
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,439
of achieving that particularly if you

173
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,399
have invested in a system of lighting

174
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:01,199
from above which is delivering say that

175
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,918
average of about 8 or9 00 is to add

176
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,960
additional light fixtures underneath and

177
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:09,560
on the side and in that case um if

178
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,439
you're per square footage of micro moles

179
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,519
is hitting about

180
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,038
12,200 um that's a good return you could

181
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,279
push it a little bit higher than that

182
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:21,199
but you're starting to get a A reduced

183
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:22,719
rate of return the more um light energy

184
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,879
you're putting in the plants aren't able

185
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,639
to absorb all that but yeah I think

186
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,240
there's huge potential for Growers to

187
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,800
basically push to get 50% % more yield

188
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,199
from the the same area that they're

189
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,800
growing in today that's pretty

190
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,919
interesting and I'll be completely

191
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,918
transparent with you I did try side side

192
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:42,198
lighting several years back chill Tech

193
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,318
came out with one they came out with two

194
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,879
different ones actually and I tried

195
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,439
using it and I'm just a small hom grower

196
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,639
so I'm only really growing for myself

197
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,879
and the yields I get just naturally with

198
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:57,478
the overhead lighting is sufficient for

199
00:07:53,879 --> 00:08:00,639
me and so I quickly used and then got

200
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:02,680
rid of my side lighting I can see how it

201
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,560
would be a benefit for you know

202
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,280
commercial facilities or those folks

203
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,959
that maybe you are a homeg grower and

204
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,799
maybe you've maxed out that grow space

205
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:11,239
and you've you've gotten the highest

206
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,598
deals you think you can ever get out of

207
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,879
that grow space well introducing that

208
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,839
might be for you to introduce

209
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,280
intercanopy lighting at that point but

210
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:21,198
for somebody like me who's a small hom

211
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:22,519
grower I'm I don't see myself ever going

212
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,960
back to interc canaby lighting just

213
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:27,079
because I'm able to get what I'm looking

214
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,120
for in regards to yield just from

215
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:31,240
overhead lighting so I gu mentioned that

216
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,200
one and I would tend to agree with you

217
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,158
and for most Growers I would only

218
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,240
recommend that sort of8 or 900 average

219
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:39,399
and that's you know how I design my

220
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,120
lights is to deliver that because the

221
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,639
analogy that a lot of people use is this

222
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,278
sort of driving a Ferrari you know that

223
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:48,720
when you start to get up to those really

224
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:51,200
high par numbers um the difficulty is if

225
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,320
if you have a bottleneck somewhere else

226
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,278
um so if some other part of your either

227
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,440
your environment control or your

228
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:00,240
nutrients or even your growing medium is

229
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,640
not able to support that growth great

230
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,159
then you're not going to deliver it so

231
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:09,240
um I'd be I'd be on I'd be right there

232
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:11,759
with you that for some Growers who who

233
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,120
are able to push that performance and

234
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,078
want to push it further absolutely for

235
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,440
most I wouldn't recommend it either

236
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:20,399
really good point yeah your plan is only

237
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,480
going to grow as fast as your limiting

238
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,440
factor right and for most folks their

239
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,120
limiting factor is CO2 which we're going

240
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,920
to get into later on in this talk but

241
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,879
yeah really good call out there next I

242
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:34,719
would like to dive into DLI so break it

243
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:36,200
down for us what is DLI and what's the

244
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,040
target for those growing medicinal

245
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:42,680
varieties yeah so DLI is simply the sum

246
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:45,958
of light the plant will receive over a

247
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:46,919
light cycle um and when we're talking in

248
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:50,239
Parts

249
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:52,078
micromols um you know the units can get

250
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,240
a little bit confusing but you go back

251
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:56,479
to what I was speaking about earlier

252
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,720
about this sort of eight or 900 micro

253
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,879
average that most Growers are growing at

254
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,160
today

255
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:07,600
that equates to um if you multiply that

256
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:10,399
800 by uh the time in the day literally

257
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,000
the amount of seconds in that day um

258
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,078
you'll get the micro number so you

259
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,919
multiply the 800 by 60 seconds by 60

260
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:21,559
Minutes by 12 hours and you get around

261
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:24,399
35 moles um and that's a another way of

262
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:26,518
looking at your your light intensity is

263
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,480
how much the plants receiving over that

264
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:31,959
that life period And as I saying ear

265
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,920
earlier new studies are showing that you

266
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:38,319
can probably push that up to about 60

267
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:41,439
mes per day so uh almost double what

268
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,240
we're doing at the moment um without

269
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,040
needing to have any sort of

270
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:49,079
sophisticated environment controls such

271
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:51,319
as elevated CO2 or anything like that um

272
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:56,239
and that's that's a very high power

273
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:58,920
intensity uh very high um amount of

274
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:03,159
light uh that plants can absorb and and

275
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:05,599
medic herbs are um an exception in in

276
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:07,360
that regard uh for example Tomatoes

277
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,759
which are known as and chilies and those

278
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,959
sort of plants that are known as very

279
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:13,559
highlight demanding plants um you know

280
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:16,278
commercial Growers wouldn't push them

281
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:19,199
Beyond about 40 miles per day so it

282
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:23,958
shows that medicinal herbs really have a

283
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,480
a unique um uh capability of absorbing a

284
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:29,439
lot of light and converting it

285
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,920
efficiently um which is as I said can be

286
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,399
could be a real benefit for Growers

287
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:35,278
particularly in a smaller area where

288
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,120
they want to push um production higher

289
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,799
production out of a small space got it

290
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,560
and DLI you mentioned the calculation

291
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:46,958
and just for reference folks can Google

292
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,599
DLI calculator and you'll be able to

293
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,359
easily find several websites that

294
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,959
actually have a calculator on there we

295
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,560
can put in the inputs and then it will

296
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:56,599
spit out what the result is I'm on one

297
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:59,879
of them right now and I just wanted to

298
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,320
talk about this so a ppfd 900

299
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:03,360
time I put for 12-hour light cycle if

300
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,360
you calculate that that's a

301
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,360
38.888421100000

302
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:34,278
for example right let's say that you are

303
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:36,519
on an 18-hour light cycle and that you

304
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:39,240
are you keep it on 18 hours and you bump

305
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,919
it up to 1200 ppfd right cuz you're

306
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:46,360
running CO2 or whatever then you're at a

307
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:47,639
77 DLI so beyond the 60 that people are

308
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,720
are are kind of getting away with I've

309
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:50,919
heard some people go up to 65 but for

310
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,720
the most part A lot of people are

311
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:54,120
falling into the Trap of light stress

312
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,720
you know they they're they're just going

313
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,480
by ppfd not taking DLI into

314
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,480
consideration and then their plants are

315
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,839
suffering because of it so highly

316
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,480
recommend folks play around with that

317
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,279
calculator kind of see what ppfd you're

318
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,159
giving the plants and how many hours and

319
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:10,759
calculating it and kind of seeing where

320
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,679
you're falling in there because uh it

321
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:14,879
can certainly be kind of surprising once

322
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:17,359
you once you get the calculator involved

323
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,078
yeah and just to say with autof flowers

324
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,720
so typically Growers would would

325
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:24,399
probably run for about 20 hours per day

326
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,320
light cycle leaving three or four hours

327
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,120
for a for a night period for the plants

328
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,480
to rest and and recuperate between um

329
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:36,039
between light cycles I would generally

330
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:39,320
recommend about 550 micr in that case um

331
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:43,120
which is pushing up to about that 40 DLI

332
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:48,199
but also with with the discussion about

333
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:50,720
vegetative and flowering and um Ms uh

334
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:54,039
per day I would say that uh push the

335
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,600
plants as hard as you can so you know if

336
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:58,360
you have a light that's capable of

337
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,000
delivering you know 1, 1200 whatever it

338
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,680
is

339
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,639
um get it up as high as you can as early

340
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:09,679
as you can even through the veg stage um

341
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,759
and just look for for for signs of light

342
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,758
stress being ma making sure at the same

343
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,480
time that you're keeping up with the

344
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,680
demands of the plant you know it's going

345
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,519
to respire more it's going to basically

346
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:21,078
need more water H it's going to need

347
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:27,240
more nutrients because it's growing

348
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:29,638
faster and just to be careful not to um

349
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,680
misdiagnose light stress

350
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:35,519
with possibly some other factors um you

351
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:37,479
know back to the sort of reference

352
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,000
points um you know we're talking about

353
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:44,519
running at 900 um uh micro moles average

354
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,958
par the sun is 2,000 in midday uh so

355
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:50,799
plants are well able to take very high

356
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:53,399
power intensity without um being damaged

357
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,958
um however if you are running them as I

358
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,839
said at at a very high performance level

359
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:00,838
other factors may come into it and you

360
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,920
may be restricting in other ways lots of

361
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:06,519
fresh air or elevated

362
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:08,759
CO2 um and being very careful with that

363
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:12,679
you give them enough water um that you

364
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:15,519
keep the humidity down um because it's

365
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:18,239
going to be respiring a lot and uh keep

366
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,278
the nutrients up good call outs there so

367
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,039
that's light quantity right that's the

368
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:25,879
density of photons coming down onto the

369
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:28,198
plant that's one thing and then there's

370
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:29,559
light spectrum often referred to as

371
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:31,519
light quality

372
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:33,359
light spectrum is often a main focus

373
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,399
point when shopping for a grow light

374
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,360
right but yeah some claim that the

375
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:41,000
priority should really be light quantity

376
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,759
instead of quality right so the density

377
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,159
of photons versus the spectrum of light

378
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:50,639
what's your take on that yeah so I would

379
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:52,679
agree um so in terms of of you know this

380
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,240
this these par photons that we're

381
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:57,838
talking about they're in the range

382
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,879
between 400 and 700 nanm uh strictly

383
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:04,279
speaking and um that's blue green and

384
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,600
red photons basically and if all of them

385
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:07,240
are present you're going to get white

386
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,759
you're going to get white light and most

387
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:14,440
LEDs these days are white LEDs

388
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:17,519
supplemented usually with um 660 nanom

389
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,839
Reds um those Reds are sometimes

390
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,919
confused as being somehow they they

391
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,800
promote flour or they they force the

392
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:25,958
plant to flour or they make it flour

393
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,919
better it's not true the reason we add

394
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:30,119
the 660 nanm Reds is because they're

395
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:33,838
highly electrically efficient that means

396
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,639
they deliver a lot of photons per watt

397
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,079
and you can think of about them a bit

398
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:41,000
like a a little Photon turbo that you'd

399
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:42,879
have in your lighting system we add as

400
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,600
much as we can afford uh they're much

401
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,078
more expensive than white lights um but

402
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,720
they'll give it that as I said that

403
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:53,159
boost in terms of efficiency but there's

404
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:56,440
lots of evidence has acred now um with

405
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:58,600
published studies showing that uh you

406
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,199
could have a range all the way from a a

407
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:05,558
very Warm White Spectrum so similar to

408
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:08,558
what um HPS would be so quite a small

409
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:11,678
proportion of blue um a lot of green and

410
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:13,359
a lot of red uh you could have a range

411
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,079
from that Spectrum all the way up to a

412
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,479
very cool white which would have a lot

413
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:19,359
of blue in it so up around the 20

414
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,720
25% you know that would have been

415
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,000
typical in in metal Hy and you will get

416
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,838
almost no difference in terms of growth

417
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,319
rate and you will get no difference in

418
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,558
terms of quality of harvest so the

419
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:35,480
potency of what's harvested will be

420
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:37,720
exactly the same irrespective of uh

421
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,679
which Spectrum you choose in that that

422
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,160
that range of of spectrum available so

423
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:46,798
it has very little difference outside of

424
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:49,558
that there are arguments about the um so

425
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,240
the the the spectrum of light can affect

426
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:53,399
U not just the growth of the plant but

427
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,640
the shape of the plant and the

428
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:59,159
characteristics of the plant so there's

429
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,320
um some belief out there that for

430
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:05,559
example fire red again can do something

431
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:08,960
um special in terms of the way the plant

432
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:13,839
develops and far red typically can cause

433
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:16,400
plants to stretch um far red is very you

434
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:20,119
get very high levels of far red uh in

435
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,480
shade uh in nature and that would signal

436
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:24,719
a plant to get out of the shade and into

437
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,880
the Sun so it's a shade avoidance

438
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,679
response it causes and it can cause

439
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,600
plants to stretch that could be useful

440
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,120
in early stages of growth you know you

441
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:37,879
want to get that canopy out want to get

442
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:40,399
that plant to extend to fill up your the

443
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,240
surface area of your tent to expand that

444
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,320
solar panel out and gather all the light

445
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,120
from your grow light so in some cases

446
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:52,439
there may be an argument for using far

447
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:54,918
red early at early stages um to to uh to

448
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,480
promote that sort of growth um and then

449
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:59,799
there's discussion around UV so again

450
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,558
not typically present in your standard

451
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:05,918
LED grow light um but you can supplement

452
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:08,960
it with um special fixtures which would

453
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,440
have UVB and UVA a

454
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,798
UVA um performs a little bit like blue

455
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,798
um it

456
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:18,798
isn't there is some evidence that it may

457
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,200
help strengthen your plant so it can

458
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,240
strengthen the cuticles that's the

459
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,000
little Parts where the the branches come

460
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,640
off and make them a little bit stronger

461
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,038
your plants are less likely to the

462
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:34,038
branches are less likely to snap um and

463
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:37,879
UVB has been shown to in some cases not

464
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:40,720
all cases uh to cause again what's kind

465
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,320
of known cloaky as a sunscreen response

466
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,759
and that is for the plant to produce

467
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:49,639
more oil uh and um that would be in the

468
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:53,558
form of Tarpin and flavonoids so get

469
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:56,200
basically you get more more sticky uh

470
00:19:53,558 --> 00:20:00,000
Harvest with higher levels of turpine so

471
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,600
better taste and smell and chirpin and

472
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,319
flavonoids

473
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,199
um there is evidence of that in a lot of

474
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,720
strains but there's also evidence that

475
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,038
with some strains that you don't get

476
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,759
that response by using UVB so I would

477
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,359
generally again if you're going for your

478
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:17,879
basic standard hom grower I'd say just

479
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,879
get don't worry too much about Spectrum

480
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,679
pretty much all grow lights these days

481
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,400
are um using the same Spectrum that's

482
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,400
for a reason because it works for

483
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,720
everybody and don't fuss about it too

484
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,640
much don't worry about it too much

485
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,240
what's much more important is the par

486
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,038
intensity so it's the amount of light

487
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,240
that the the fixture is delivering and

488
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:39,879
just look at the the the grow light

489
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:44,359
manufacturer should be providing a par

490
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:47,200
map so they should be showing the par uh

491
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:49,959
distribution over its specified area so

492
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,480
say it's a 750 watt light going into a

493
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:56,880
5x5 it should show that light and it's

494
00:20:52,480 --> 00:21:00,240
Optimum hanging height over a 5x5 space

495
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,360
and give you a grid showing the par

496
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,759
intensity right across the area of your

497
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,798
um your target plan canopy and you

498
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:10,919
should look for even distribution and

499
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:12,278
high intensity got it and if folks

500
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:14,720
really want to get down to the needy

501
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:16,640
greedy of the individual light in the

502
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,240
light spectrum and how they impact a

503
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,159
plant we covered that in the past

504
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,480
episode so highly encourage you guys to

505
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:25,278
tune into that episode after this one

506
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,960
because Shane breaks it down everything

507
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:30,798
from blue red UV IR all that stuff is

508
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,079
broken down and how it impacts the plant

509
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,879
it was really really great talk there so

510
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:36,240
just wanted to mention that again now

511
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,880
one thing in the last Garden talk

512
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,038
episode that you talked about is that

513
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,760
was back in 2021 you had mentioned that

514
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:46,798
back then Gro lights had enough far red

515
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:49,519
in them that there really isn't a need

516
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:51,278
to add additional far red like

517
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,079
supplemental lighting there do you feel

518
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:57,798
that's still the same case here in

519
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:59,519
2024 yeah I do yeah so since then

520
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:02,918
there's more evidence has come out that

521
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:05,960
far red is photosynthetic so the photons

522
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:09,000
beyond that strict par range of 700

523
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,319
nanometers up to about 750 nanometers

524
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,880
they cause photosynthesis however they

525
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:15,639
cause photosynthesis at a lower rate so

526
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,559
they're less efficient in terms of

527
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,240
causing photosynthesis than for example

528
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:22,399
red or green or blue photons so

529
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,200
investing and spending extra on

530
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,759
additional far red LEDs within a fixture

531
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,480
in my view as a waste of money you're

532
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:33,158
not getting the the uh growth and the

533
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,640
yield return from that extra investment

534
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:38,960
that you would by just simply buying a

535
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:42,120
fixture with more white LEDs or red LEDs

536
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:46,159
for example um and the other factor is

537
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:49,199
that all pretty much all white LEDs they

538
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,840
have a little tail of far red just at

539
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,480
the end of their Spectrum typically

540
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:55,240
about 2 or 3% far red in it so if you

541
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,240
really desperately want to have far red

542
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,079
for some reason there already is some

543
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,319
there um

544
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:06,000
and H as I said if you do add too much

545
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:07,678
far red and that it's it's a trade-off

546
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,440
here by the way or it's a balancing act

547
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,960
between blue and red so if if blue will

548
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,798
cause short dense growth um far red will

549
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,759
cause

550
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:19,359
stretching um if you have a lot of blue

551
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:22,240
you can afford to put a lot of far red

552
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:24,399
in there um because the far red

553
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,798
shouldn't cause stretching in that case

554
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,240
but if you don't have a lot of blue and

555
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:30,918
you put uh too much far in there red in

556
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,519
there you'll have stretched plants and

557
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:34,278
uh that's an inefficient way to grow

558
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:37,558
because really what you want is is

559
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:40,640
flowers and putting energy into more

560
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:44,038
stocks and um more leaves and sort of

561
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:47,200
more height is a waste of energy so uh

562
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:50,000
again in my view I don't think there's a

563
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,080
strong argument for adding far red LEDs

564
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,319
to a fixture whatsoever and sometimes it

565
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:54,798
actually make it a little bit more

566
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:57,519
difficult to grow just because you've

567
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:59,918
got those strong those long stretchy Wes

568
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,599
and once the buds kind of build up on it

569
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,000
it could become so heavy that they just

570
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,879
start flopping over happens with a lot

571
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,519
of OG strains I battled that in the past

572
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,320
where I had to put support staks and

573
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:12,359
then you know tomato cages and all that

574
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:14,639
stuff so it can be a challenge when you

575
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,719
have those long stretchy that long

576
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,360
stretch in flowering getting those heavy

577
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,038
buds it can be a little bit challenging

578
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:22,319
on that Avenue yeah well I remember back

579
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:25,278
in the HPS days and I I turn I'd switch

580
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:27,798
over to HPS and then it was just a 8we

581
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:30,079
battle for trying to control everything

582
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:31,720
and you know trying to as you say tie

583
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:34,240
everything down and get it away from the

584
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,360
Heat and all that stuff so yeah you know

585
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,278
we we have really good Spectrum now with

586
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:43,759
LEDs we can tailor it um let not mess it

587
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:45,798
up now you touched upon UV lighting and

588
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:47,119
you kind of answered the question I'm

589
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:49,720
about to ask I want to ask it a little

590
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:53,439
more direct which is you mentioned that

591
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:56,120
with the far red not really worth adding

592
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,960
a supplemental Lighting in your opinion

593
00:24:56,119 --> 00:25:00,479
would you say that's the same for UV is

594
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,399
there enough UV light in most fixtures

595
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,399
these days that it's not really worth it

596
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:09,239
to buy supplemental UV bars well you

597
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:12,199
don't get any UV um from White LEDs or

598
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:15,240
red LEDs so the the UV LEDs would have

599
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:19,480
to be added in um there's only really

600
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:22,880
efficient UV LEDs in the range which is

601
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:26,720
just below 400 nanom so around 385 or

602
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,200
390 nanometers it's basically blue um

603
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:33,120
plants see it as blue

604
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,000
um and it doesn't uh affect either the

605
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,599
growth very significantly so it's not

606
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,919
very photosynthetically efficient um so

607
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:42,199
it's not going to add to your yield it's

608
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:44,600
not going to add to your growth rate and

609
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,798
um there's yet to be strong evidence

610
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:49,439
that it has any significant health

611
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:52,639
benefit um for your plants or in terms

612
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:56,320
of potency uvp is slightly different uh

613
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:59,840
UVB is not really achievable using LEDs

614
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:02,918
uh at least not um commercial viable now

615
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:07,480
yet um so typically people would use

616
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:09,759
florescence uh to deliver UVB and that's

617
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:14,038
a very cheap and efficient way of doing

618
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:17,158
it um there is strong evidence that it

619
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:19,440
will and again this is strain dependent

620
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,840
um so my experience is going to a

621
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,919
commercial grower actually in the UK and

622
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:28,599
it was with um medicinal herbs for CBD

623
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,520
varieties and it was in a actually a

624
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:31,599
Canadian parent company which was triing

625
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:34,918
the UC of

626
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:38,639
UVB and they were demonstrating in some

627
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:40,278
cases up to 40% increase in Turpin and

628
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,840
flavonoids and they were using it for

629
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:45,119
oil extraction so it's obviously very

630
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:48,119
commercially uh beneficial for them to

631
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:51,199
be able to um get a lot higher uh

632
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:53,319
extraction rate from the plants um but

633
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,679
in some strains they saw very little

634
00:26:53,319 --> 00:27:00,038
response um however it's a fairly cheap

635
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:03,480
um addition very cheap to run so you'd

636
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:05,038
need approximately about 20 watts of

637
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,720
fluorescent in a

638
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:12,960
5x5 and that would be to deliver a UVB

639
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,319
intensity of about um half what midday

640
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,360
Sun would be

641
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,158
outdoors um and just for a couple of

642
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:20,519
hours a day in the last few weeks of

643
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:24,039
flowering to stimulate that response

644
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:27,038
from the plants anecdotally lot of

645
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:30,839
customer I sell one so you know this

646
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:32,558
comes with a a warning but um I get a

647
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:34,079
lot of customers anecdotally coming back

648
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:37,079
to me and saying they they they've had

649
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:38,839
good results with it and I've had some

650
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:41,759
uh say they haven't had any result at

651
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:45,639
all so uh it depends it's strain

652
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,398
dependent I don't have any data on um

653
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:51,080
which ones respond and which ones don't

654
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:53,798
and why um but there definitely is cases

655
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:56,439
where it can be a pretty efficient and

656
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:58,319
cheap way of uh boosting the quality of

657
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,880
your Harvest that's really interesting

658
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,359
good to know all that and yeah it makes

659
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,159
sense that the strain would be it would

660
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:06,319
be dependent on the strain right it's

661
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,240
like these plants there so many

662
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,839
different varieties and they react so

663
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,558
differently to all the things that we

664
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,000
throw at them whether it be lighting or

665
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:15,359
whether it be the environment or whether

666
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,640
it be the nutrition so yeah the way the

667
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:20,439
plant expresses itself I can imagine

668
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,679
that it's different for each cultivar

669
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,320
yeah well you a commercial this this

670
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:28,440
facility that I I travel to um they were

671
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:31,918
also selling to supermarkets and um they

672
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:35,640
were selling basil rosemary uh Sage all

673
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:38,200
these different um herbs for uh

674
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,600
supermarkets and the the biggest

675
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,038
response they were getting was actually

676
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:45,278
from rosemary um and you know you may

677
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:48,398
you may know yourself like I we've got a

678
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:51,079
little herb garden at home uh it grows

679
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,798
under sort of a little plastic kind of

680
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:56,000
greenhouse we have out the back Garden

681
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:59,679
in the winter um just to keep it away

682
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:04,038
from the frost um but until that that is

683
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:06,600
brought out into the sun uh and hardened

684
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:08,960
as gardeners would say um you won't get

685
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:11,719
that stickiness on the leaves um it

686
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:15,200
needs that UVB to stimulate the oil

687
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,880
production um as well um and you do

688
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,399
actually see it in particularly in

689
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:24,760
winter time if I buy um Rosemary from a

690
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:27,518
a supermarket it'll be sort of a dry um

691
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:30,079
almost leathery surface to the leaves uh

692
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,000
rather than that sort of sticky gooey um

693
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:34,319
surface and that's because it's grown

694
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,159
inside in green houses and UVB doesn't

695
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:39,278
um transmit through the glass so um as I

696
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:40,960
said from a commercial point of view

697
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:44,759
there are a lot of facilities which are

698
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:48,640
are installing UVB into um into their

699
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:50,200
facilities to supplement um the light

700
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,840
that's coming through the glass and

701
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,759
deliver UVB to stimulate this um this

702
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:56,558
oil production H that's very interesting

703
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:59,038
I didn't know that I want to shine away

704
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,839
from talking about light for a few and

705
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,879
talk about some other things that relate

706
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:05,599
to growing plants one of the things I

707
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,600
want to get into is CO2 now you've been

708
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:10,798
doing some experiments or Research into

709
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:13,158
supplementing CO2 talk to us about your

710
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:17,839
findings well on a personal basis I have

711
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:20,120
failed uh uh dramatically in all my uh

712
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:22,798
experiments to improve the benefits of

713
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:26,759
CO2 so I haven't yet had firsthand

714
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:28,480
experience of um seeing the benefits I

715
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:30,960
I've had it in the early stages of

716
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:35,038
growing so I've done it with chili

717
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:39,519
plants and I've grown side by sides same

718
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:43,319
strain of chilies um so cuttings um in

719
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:46,759
the same media same environment uh one

720
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:49,200
with elevated CO2 and one without and

721
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:52,440
what I saw in the early stages was

722
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,399
definite increase in growth rate in the

723
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,720
sort of vegetative stage for the the

724
00:30:54,398 --> 00:31:00,879
chili plants um but then I saw that

725
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,519
uh once it started fruiting flowering

726
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:07,799
and fruiting that that uh that advantage

727
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:11,679
or that increased growth rate seem to to

728
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:14,480
to come back uh to reduce so that's my

729
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,679
experience uh and I've failed publicly

730
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:21,000
doing that on a few grow uh grow

731
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,360
comparisons I've done online um however

732
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,519
uh people who are much better than me

733
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:28,000
and more capable than me um have grown

734
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,679
in particular you know Dr Bruce bugby

735
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,679
and Mitch West Morland in Utah State

736
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:34,200
University um some of the very few

737
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:37,038
people who actually published their

738
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,798
results um and that's again growing with

739
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:43,638
medicinal herbs and they've shown that

740
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:47,278
there's an up to 30% increase in growth

741
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:48,798
rate if you elevate the CO2 level from

742
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:52,038
what's in the environment which is about

743
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:54,079
420 parts per million up to about 1,200

744
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:57,119
parts per million and that's all other

745
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,918
things being equal so if if you are in

746
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:00,678
the fortunate situation where you can

747
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:05,320
have a closed environment for your grow

748
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:08,559
room um you can potentially use what is

749
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:10,678
a fairly cheap input CO2 so using a hot

750
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:13,638
burner basically a little gas pilot

751
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:16,919
burner to produce the CO2 or you can use

752
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:20,959
it cold from a

753
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:22,639
basically a bottle of um compressed CO2

754
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,798
you can get from a welding

755
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:27,240
suppliers um so you can do it in two

756
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:30,720
different ways and potentially it's a

757
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:34,079
very cheap input to get a a big increase

758
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:37,558
in growth rate um plants don't use a

759
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:41,000
huge amount of CO2 in terms of mass um

760
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:45,119
so you could um for example you know be

761
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,759
using a a bottle of propane mice cost 20

762
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:48,398
or

763
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,759
$30 and it could be feeding your grow

764
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:52,678
room for the three or four months that

765
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:55,000
you're running a grow and um you know

766
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:56,559
you could be doing you could be getting

767
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,440
an increase in growth rate potentially

768
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:03,558
of 30% for 20 $30 so you know it it it

769
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,960
it huge potential there um the

770
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:09,759
difficulty is for small Growers it adds

771
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,519
a level of complexity because if you are

772
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:14,200
running a CO2 burner it's going to add

773
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:17,720
heat to your growroom um it's also going

774
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:22,159
to add moisture so you get Co2 but also

775
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:24,519
H2O when you burn the um the gas and so

776
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,799
you have to have environment control uh

777
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:30,359
you have to be able to take that

778
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:32,599
humidity out and you don't want to be

779
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:35,079
expelling the CO2 that you're producing

780
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:37,759
so you want to you need to have

781
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,960
basically air conditioning system setup

782
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:41,919
where the air conditioning is of the

783
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,200
more sort of sophisticated kind where it

784
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,840
has a you know the radiator is outside

785
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,639
of either the grow room or the lung room

786
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:51,558
um which is out

787
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:53,638
of you know it's bit sort of higher

788
00:33:51,558 --> 00:33:56,519
technical level than a lot of people are

789
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:58,678
are willing or able to do and uh again I

790
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:01,720
wouldn't be advising people to do that I

791
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,960
I you know if if if you want more growth

792
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:07,759
maybe just add a little bit more area to

793
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,760
your to your tent maybe push um Power

794
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,719
intensity a little bit higher or even

795
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,240
just change the medium that you're using

796
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:17,039
to a more efficient medium um lots of

797
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:19,279
other ways to get an increase in growth

798
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,199
rate however if you've if you've

799
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,919
explored all those options and you

800
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,838
really want to push it further it uh it

801
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,960
definitely has potential yeah I

802
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:31,199
completely agree I've played around with

803
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,800
adding CO2 off and on over the years and

804
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:36,559
you know I've used everything from those

805
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:39,280
CO2 mushroom bags to the tnb Natural

806
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:41,559
canisters that you uh shake up every day

807
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,800
and put on there it's very hard to

808
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:44,878
measure right there's not a lot of

809
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,800
companies out there making good CO2

810
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:51,918
monitors we can measure result and

811
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:56,839
actually there is there so there's it's

812
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:58,759
not a direct CO2 sensor but is I don't

813
00:34:56,838 --> 00:35:00,519
really down the technology quite

814
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,320
honestly but there's there's a lot of

815
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:05,920
sensors around now and you'll see them

816
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,320
online as air quality sensors and

817
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,240
they're able to detect CO2 levels pretty

818
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:15,519
accurately you get them for about

819
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:18,358
$100 so the um measurement is getting

820
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:20,599
easier um and in fact you what we were

821
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:24,000
talking about earlier about light stress

822
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:26,160
um I think in a lot of cases it's

823
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,119
potentially actually the plants are

824
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:32,559
being um starved of CO2 and I think it

825
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,519
would be quite useful particularly with

826
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:36,960
large Growers you know you these big

827
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:39,159
sort of 8 by 810 and stuff you got dead

828
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,519
areas in that tent you've got it's very

829
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:44,000
hard to move around the air um

830
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:47,358
sufficiently that you're going to

831
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,960
replenish the CO2 in every place so it

832
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:52,639
it I would recommend for those who are

833
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,559
sort of pushing the limits to if you can

834
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:56,480
invest in a CO2 sensor and just keep an

835
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,519
eye on it because it could be a

836
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,318
restrictive factor for you

837
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:02,280
yeah I completely agree I have a um a

838
00:36:00,318 --> 00:36:04,920
CO2 monitor by the company's actually

839
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,319
called CO2 meter it's an older one it's

840
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,280
probably about this big maybe for those

841
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:12,440
just listening in it's got to be about 6

842
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,000
in it's roundish and uh that is

843
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,039
something I've been using but you know

844
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,400
I'm not in a sealed room so it's like

845
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:22,679
you know that me using the CO2 canisters

846
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,358
and using the exhale bags it's like it's

847
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:25,519
up and down results like every time I

848
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:29,639
went in there it would either be

849
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:32,039
elevated 700 12200 great or it would be

850
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:33,358
normal level and I'm like it's just so

851
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:35,358
hard for me to measure it as a homeg

852
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,400
grower and like I mentioned in the

853
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:39,838
beginning I don't need the yield you

854
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,079
know I don't need a 30% so like I I

855
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:42,440
think it's situational the reason why I

856
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:44,039
bring this up is because I think it's

857
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,960
situational a lot of people hear about

858
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:47,358
these things that help with growth rate

859
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,679
and stuff like that and they

860
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:50,799
automatically apply it in there because

861
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:52,879
they feel like they need to but look at

862
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,519
your own personal goals right if you're

863
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,599
already achieving the yield then why

864
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:59,440
bother investing into it another thing

865
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:03,000
folks don't really realize is if you're

866
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,599
a home girl like me you're exhaling CO2

867
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,159
right so like CO2 levels every time I go

868
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,079
in there it's elevated just because I

869
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:11,519
live here I have a fiance that lives

870
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:13,560
here I have a cat I have a daughter now

871
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:16,838
so we're all exhaling CO2 that's

872
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:19,159
contributing to my grow realm and the

873
00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:21,318
plant growth that's happening there so

874
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:23,000
big I mentioned those things it's like

875
00:37:21,318 --> 00:37:25,440
it's fantastic that we're finding out

876
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,519
all these things about CO2 and and that

877
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,760
it's increasing that much and I'm

878
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,519
totally with you if you're looking to

879
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,440
get it up to that next level add CO2

880
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:36,119
absolutely but it's not for everybody is

881
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,960
what I feel like and I did do a test of

882
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:40,240
those mushroom bags I I just did one

883
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,440
literally today I just posted one today

884
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:44,799
um company wasn't happy with my previous

885
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,720
test sent me another one to test and I

886
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,318
found out the same thing that um you

887
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:54,239
know you this is one of these uh it's

888
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:56,920
got straw and um velium in it and you

889
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:58,399
blow air through it and you get this um

890
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,680
they don't work you know they'll

891
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,240
elevated it for a short time um this is

892
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:05,440
in a seal tent but it drops away pretty

893
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:07,078
quickly um really the only way

894
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,200
effectively to do it as I said is with a

895
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:11,680
burner or with the CO2 bottles all those

896
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:15,439
other methods

897
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:17,039
are um they're not very efficient glad

898
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,880
you uncovered that yeah let us know

899
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:20,079
about that that that's good I'm glad

900
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,960
there's guys like you that are actually

901
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:25,480
doing studies on it to see whether or

902
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:29,039
not it works or if we're being fed snake

903
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:31,400
oil here snake unfortunately let's

904
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:32,440
transition over to temperature so

905
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,079
temperature within the plants

906
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:38,000
environment can greatly impact growth

907
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:42,000
rate talk to us about crop steering with

908
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,119
temperature Yes again fascinating um uh

909
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,079
research coming out of of Utah State

910
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:48,318
University I interviewed both Bruce

911
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:52,760
bugby and Mid West Morland two people

912
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:54,400
have been working on on um on um with

913
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:59,920
very sophisticated

914
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:01,800
equipment um to test uh do control tests

915
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,639
of varying different environmental

916
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,720
factors and seeing what effect they have

917
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:08,279
on both growth rate and yield and

918
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,559
quality

919
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,680
and the the temperature is particularly

920
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,639
different difficult to do because you

921
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:17,000
have to have the same conditions but in

922
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:19,759
separate rooms with environmental

923
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,760
control and quite expensive to do as

924
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,599
well they've done really extensive

925
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,040
testing on a number of different

926
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,760
cultivars and they've demonstrated

927
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:33,639
there's to two parts to it I suppose

928
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:36,599
first of all is is generally um between

929
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:39,639
about 20° centigrade so about 68

930
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:42,559
Fahrenheit and about uh 26 27 degrees

931
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:48,318
Centigrade so about 85

932
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:50,838
Fahrenheit um is Optimum for growth um

933
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:53,880
if you increase it in that range you

934
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:58,440
will get a higher growth rate so the

935
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:00,960
general idea is to uh start warm

936
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,760
um so you want to get again that get

937
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,679
those plants to put out their canopy as

938
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:08,040
quickly as possible you want to get them

939
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:09,960
to get up to as large a size as possible

940
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:14,759
before you flip or before they start to

941
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:16,760
flour however once buds start forming um

942
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,800
buds are peculiar in that they're fens

943
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,640
effectively like a a ball of leaves um

944
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:26,119
tightly packed together and they have a

945
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:29,879
difficulty in uh losing their heat and

946
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:32,079
also uh losing moisture so respiring um

947
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,160
because there's a a large density in a

948
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,280
in a small surface area rather than a

949
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,559
leaf which is a very low density in a

950
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,359
high surface area so these buds have a

951
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:44,039
difficulty in in get riding of getting

952
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:46,838
rid of heat and respiring uh also buds

953
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:50,599
tend to be at the top and they tend to

954
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:52,599
absorb that bit of um radiant heat

955
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:53,559
coming from in particularly if you're

956
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:56,960
using

957
00:40:53,559 --> 00:41:00,799
hid um they can get they can be 3 4

958
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:03,480
degre Centigrade you know 5 6° F higher

959
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,000
than the temperature of the room um

960
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,838
because they're they're absorbing that

961
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:13,318
heat but they're not able to expel that

962
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:15,400
heat so what is is um is advis now is to

963
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:18,119
reduce down the temperature down around

964
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:22,480
that around 20° centigrade or 68

965
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:24,599
Fahrenheit for um at least the second

966
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,159
half of flowering if not earlier so once

967
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,838
those those buds are starting to form

968
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:30,480
and become dense

969
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:34,719
and what they've shown through extensive

970
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:38,480
studies is that um if you do run hotter

971
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:44,000
than that there's a very uh steep drop

972
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:47,599
off in um its ability to retain um

973
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,159
cannaboids and um Turpin and flavonoids

974
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,359
so effectively the quality of your

975
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:55,118
Harvest will reduce um if you're running

976
00:41:52,358 --> 00:41:57,639
too high a temperature in in the latter

977
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:01,599
latter sort of half of flowering

978
00:41:57,639 --> 00:42:03,318
um and it's really dramatic um it was

979
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,280
unfortunately it's a little bit more

980
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:07,358
it's a little bit layered because it

981
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,400
does depend on strain and different

982
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:12,960
strains um are uh tolerate different

983
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,838
ranges of temperature so there sort like

984
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,480
a 5° Centigrade range of of tolerance so

985
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:23,039
some will prefer it to be 25 some will

986
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:28,039
need to be down at 20 um to retain that

987
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:31,000
uh that potency but um if you go

988
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:35,279
if you go from say say the optimum in

989
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:38,838
terms of of retaining um uh potency is

990
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:42,160
at at 20° centigrade if you go to 25 it

991
00:42:38,838 --> 00:42:45,799
can drop by over half um so you can have

992
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:50,239
a 50% reduction in the potency of your

993
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:52,280
Harvest if you're running 5° uh warmer

994
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:55,039
um than the optimum for the plan so it's

995
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,880
quite dramatic um it was something that

996
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:00,519
I used to hear a lot uh and doly from

997
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,838
Growers you know you'd often hear I get

998
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:05,880
a much higher quality harvest in Winter

999
00:43:02,838 --> 00:43:08,480
for example um you know in summer I

1000
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,079
struggle um and you know there's an

1001
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,000
underlying reason for that and they've

1002
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,960
now there's now evidence to support that

1003
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,880
but very interesting and very useful for

1004
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,280
Growers to know difficulty for Growers

1005
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,838
is another layer of difficulty for them

1006
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,400
is trying to get that temperature down

1007
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:27,799
and flour um and trying to get it down

1008
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,240
to 20° you know most people's homes

1009
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,880
will be over 20° centigrade you know

1010
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:35,439
there'll be 22 23° where we find a

1011
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,440
comfortable you know 70 75

1012
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:41,480
fenhe um so you know it needs air

1013
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:44,519
conditioning effectively to cool it down

1014
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:47,639
uh not um possible for a lot of people

1015
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:50,199
but there are some fairly easy methods

1016
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:52,318
of at least being on the lower end or as

1017
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:55,078
low as you possibly can one of them is

1018
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:58,558
operating your light schedule at night

1019
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:00,359
um so you know you're you're house uh

1020
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:02,839
the air you're pulling in from outside

1021
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:06,159
if you are uh will be cooler at night so

1022
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:10,039
it gives you a better opportunity to um

1023
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:13,118
to to bring that temperature down um and

1024
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:15,719
uh and high rates of air flow so we do

1025
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,920
want humidity to be down as well in that

1026
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:19,480
second part of flowering um and if you

1027
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,639
are doing that you're probably pulling

1028
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,719
through air pretty quickly uh through

1029
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:25,279
the tent um and therefore keeping the

1030
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:27,558
temperature down but it's it's not

1031
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,960
possible for everybody all would say is

1032
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:30,680
just try and keep your temperatures as

1033
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:35,079
low as possible for that phase of

1034
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:37,558
growing man 68° F for the second half

1035
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:39,440
flowering that's probably eye openening

1036
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:40,680
for a lot of people listening to this

1037
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,358
you know I've heard about lowering the

1038
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,159
temp towards the end of flowering the

1039
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:45,199
final couple weeks of flowering you know

1040
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,118
cuz like you mentioned the higher the

1041
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:49,759
temp the more tpine loss and flavonoid

1042
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,318
loss that's happening right it's just

1043
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,319
evaporating right it's going into the

1044
00:44:51,318 --> 00:44:58,358
air but 68° I mean that's 10° lower than

1045
00:44:55,318 --> 00:45:00,079
what was genuinely recommended so by me

1046
00:44:58,358 --> 00:45:01,880
too by the way so I I would have been

1047
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,720
recommending that higher temperature up

1048
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:06,358
to very recently until I you know until

1049
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:08,039
I got this this new information and

1050
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:12,039
those studies are only they're not

1051
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:14,159
actually fully published yet um again

1052
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:16,960
the guy's ut state have released the

1053
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:19,199
information uh Mitch University or Mitch

1054
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,119
West Morland from Utah state has done a

1055
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:25,519
few podcasts including my own where he's

1056
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:27,358
uh he's shown these results um with two

1057
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:30,519
different cultivars

1058
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:33,480
and um you know it's it's the evidence

1059
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:36,960
is plain and clear so with the quality

1060
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:38,760
going up yield has to go down was it

1061
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,280
measured like how much of a yield loss

1062
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,960
there is running that L that's the

1063
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,319
interesting thing so what they and I

1064
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,079
don't fully understand this and I'm not

1065
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:49,599
going to pretend to but what what I

1066
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:52,880
gathered from what I was told is that

1067
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:55,280
um there's two things working against

1068
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:58,000
each other or for whichever way you look

1069
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:01,519
at it so the relatively lower

1070
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:05,079
temperature in flowering is it actually

1071
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:08,800
promotes the plant to push um resources

1072
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:12,160
basically into the flowers um so you may

1073
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:15,039
not get a a high a total mass of plant

1074
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:17,199
at the end um but you're pushing the

1075
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,880
plant to put its energy where you want

1076
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:23,358
it to which is into the flowers with

1077
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:26,240
that lower temperature um and there's

1078
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:29,558
less of an effect once you get into that

1079
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:33,959
sort of 20 20 to 26° Centigrade or sort

1080
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:37,040
of 68 to 75 80 fahit um the difference

1081
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:40,199
in growth rate um between the lower and

1082
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:42,599
upper range there is not huge um so

1083
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:45,519
you're not losing that much in terms of

1084
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:48,838
mass of plant by reducing it at that

1085
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:52,440
stage um and and as I said it's it's

1086
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:54,679
it's it's unbalance it's far more

1087
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,200
beneficial to have a a lower temperature

1088
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:58,239
than a higher one looking forward to

1089
00:46:56,199 --> 00:47:00,239
seeing the final results on what they

1090
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:01,879
come out with let's get into measuring

1091
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:05,078
light I have a few questions for you

1092
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:07,358
here lumens is measuring lumens

1093
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:09,720
beneficial at all or should Growers stop

1094
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:12,519
measuring lumens entirely right so a lot

1095
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:17,000
of people used to use lumens not anymore

1096
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:20,440
though yeah so um as I said before par

1097
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:24,159
um as in the um particles of light that

1098
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:28,119
cause growth are in about the range of

1099
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:32,199
400 to 700 nanometers um and they're you

1100
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:34,880
know more or less absorbed equally um

1101
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:37,279
within reason so blue red blue green and

1102
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,559
red photons are absorbed at a very

1103
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,440
similar rate um however the eye uh and

1104
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:45,960
look

1105
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:48,400
sensors um they um are much more

1106
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:53,119
sensitive to Green than blue or red so

1107
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:56,639
they will see green um more effectively

1108
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,640
um than they will blue and uh red having

1109
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:00,558
said said

1110
00:47:57,639 --> 00:48:02,199
that you know I I wouldn't discourage

1111
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:05,160
somebody from using a lux meter if

1112
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:07,519
they're trying to um tickly look at

1113
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:09,279
intensity across their grow area using a

1114
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:11,759
lookx meter will show you the relative

1115
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:15,800
values of light intensity across that

1116
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:19,200
grow area um very accurately so if you

1117
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:21,359
want to for example um look to see what

1118
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:23,078
your intensity is in the corners or if

1119
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:25,318
you've got a large grow area and you've

1120
00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:28,640
got you're mapping out lights and trying

1121
00:48:25,318 --> 00:48:30,558
to cover your your um your canopy evenly

1122
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:32,879
using a lookx meter is a perfectly good

1123
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:37,440
solution for that if you want to see

1124
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:40,240
what your actual par number is there is

1125
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,280
a correlation between what a look meter

1126
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:44,078
will read and a par number it's

1127
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:47,079
basically a factor you can multiply the

1128
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:50,640
looks reading by um I've got a Blog on

1129
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:54,000
my website and um on the YouTube channel

1130
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:56,358
um showing you how you can use a look

1131
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,400
meter to measure par effectively so you

1132
00:48:56,358 --> 00:49:00,639
measure looks then just multiply it by a

1133
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,960
number um you can also use it in

1134
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:06,039
conjunction with an app so if you're on

1135
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:09,119
um Android or iOS now actually there's

1136
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:10,639
an app called a ppfd app it's a guy I've

1137
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:14,440
worked with a little bit in the past and

1138
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:17,159
he's you can pair what is a a cheap and

1139
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:19,639
readily available looks meter called the

1140
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:22,679
unity um it's the Bluetooth version and

1141
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:26,199
you can pair that to the app and you'll

1142
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:28,879
get at least 95% accuracy in terms of

1143
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:31,439
the power numbers I've tested it with

1144
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,880
various different light sources um

1145
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,240
extensively and they're pretty accurate

1146
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:38,119
but there's also a number of apps you

1147
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:42,159
can use with your phone too so again the

1148
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:44,559
the uh there's the what the photon app I

1149
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:46,679
can't remember they changed it

1150
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,798
to I can't remember it was called the

1151
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:54,519
photon app but there's one on iOS um

1152
00:49:49,798 --> 00:49:56,318
which is uh uh quite um quite accurate

1153
00:49:54,519 --> 00:49:57,719
uh you have to use basically a piece of

1154
00:49:56,318 --> 00:50:00,759
paper

1155
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:02,558
over the um the front camera as a

1156
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,319
diffuser um so you basically just

1157
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,040
cellotape a little bit of paper over the

1158
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:10,039
front um camera on your iPhone and you

1159
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:12,599
can use that as an as a a parameter and

1160
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:15,199
it'll be perfectly adequate for most

1161
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:19,119
homeg Growers and the ppfd app you can

1162
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:22,798
do the same now across Android and uh

1163
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:25,599
and iPhones so it's um It's relatively

1164
00:50:22,798 --> 00:50:28,280
easy to do there are other sensors I've

1165
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:31,119
just done an extensive test of six

1166
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:34,400
parameters comparing the Lor which is

1167
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:37,160
like the industry standard $1,500 one

1168
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,960
with uh the apog which is like the $600

1169
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:42,838
one which is with the spot on which is

1170
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:47,519
the $350 one with the photon which is

1171
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:49,078
the $160 I think and a couple of other

1172
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:53,880
ones which were cheaper and not very

1173
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:55,318
good but those higher priced ones the

1174
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:59,680
difference in accuracy between the

1175
00:50:55,318 --> 00:51:03,880
$1,500 meter and $160 Meer is only about

1176
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:06,639
5% and if you're growing at home 5% 95%

1177
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:10,200
accuracy on a power meter is all you

1178
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:13,679
need um so you can do it for 160 bucks

1179
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:17,118
um buy them on Amazon it's the photo

1180
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:18,199
it's the Hydrofarm photo bio parameter

1181
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,559
you want to get a little bit more

1182
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:24,239
accurate you can use the spot on um

1183
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:27,200
which is again i' I've used here

1184
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:28,759
extensively and and on you go but

1185
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:30,960
you only really need to be spending big

1186
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:34,160
books if you're a commercial grower and

1187
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,838
5% means something to you you know um

1188
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:37,639
otherwise you can do it pretty cheaply

1189
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:39,639
and easily I'm glad to see that there

1190
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:41,759
are more affordable options coming on

1191
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:44,279
the market when it comes to measuring

1192
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,359
light I mean jez warped back five years

1193
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:50,200
ago and apog sensor was the cheapest you

1194
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:52,078
could get right hit the 600 so I have uh

1195
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:55,519
two different models of them and at

1196
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:57,400
first they were only what uh 400 to 700

1197
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:59,400
and then they came out with the one that

1198
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,358
extends beyond that cuz we found out

1199
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,960
that par is extends a little bit beyond

1200
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:04,679
that so that was good that's the one I

1201
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,119
have but yeah it's really good to see

1202
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:07,558
that they got the spot on meter which is

1203
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:09,318
cheaper and then the other ones you

1204
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:12,319
mentioned actually using your phone to

1205
00:52:09,318 --> 00:52:14,920
get an idea of what the light levels is

1206
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:17,199
even if it's only 95% accurate I mean

1207
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:21,240
that that's pretty accurate yeah yeah it

1208
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:24,279
is for for all intens of purposes your

1209
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:27,399
you know your abs are adequately and

1210
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:29,680
reliably measure light how to use it

1211
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,039
though is the is the next thing and

1212
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:34,039
that's where people come a little bit

1213
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:36,920
unstuck I think um again I got a little

1214
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:39,480
tutorial on um on our YouTube channel

1215
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:41,039
about using parameters but really what

1216
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:44,159
you want to do is first of all measure

1217
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:45,838
their center point so most lights are

1218
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:48,399
going to have higher intensity in the

1219
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:50,880
center even LED bar lights in around the

1220
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:54,079
center is going to be higher

1221
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:56,240
and want to trade off dropping your

1222
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:58,440
light as low as possible to get as much

1223
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:59,879
light down onto the plants because if

1224
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,480
the lights up very high light will

1225
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,480
bounce around and be lost um it'll go

1226
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,960
every other way except hitting the plant

1227
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:10,318
canopy um so getting it down nice and

1228
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:13,039
low is is um is very

1229
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:18,279
beneficial dropping for example from

1230
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:20,719
about um 24 in down to about 12 in will

1231
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,720
improve the amount of light even with

1232
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:26,519
reflective walls in a grow tent by about

1233
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:28,399
10 to 15% so you can get real uh B

1234
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:30,960
benefits or improvements in efficiency

1235
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,559
by optimizing that light height so

1236
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,920
you're checking the center measurements

1237
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,040
and then just checking the corners

1238
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,519
really the corners and the edges because

1239
00:53:36,039 --> 00:53:38,960
there's no point in getting really high

1240
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:40,798
light intensity in the center of your

1241
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,960
tent and then all the the plants around

1242
00:53:40,798 --> 00:53:46,920
the periphery are suffering so trying to

1243
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:50,318
do that tradeoff and generally I would

1244
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:53,480
say you're trying to get in the corner

1245
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:56,039
about half the maximum number in the

1246
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:58,159
center it's not possible to get 100%

1247
00:53:56,039 --> 00:54:01,279
uniform formity so don't try it won't

1248
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:03,279
happen um and it's okay to have that

1249
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,079
fall off it'll fall off fairly gradually

1250
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:09,559
to the edges um so if you're

1251
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:11,920
getting 50 60% of the intensity in the

1252
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:14,359
center out in those Corners you've

1253
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:17,240
pretty much got it optimized how much

1254
00:54:14,358 --> 00:54:18,838
par in ppfd do you generally recommend

1255
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:22,239
for the different stages of growth when

1256
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:25,358
growing medicinal varieties so very

1257
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:27,598
young plants um seedlings you can push

1258
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:30,039
it very high but I don't advise it again

1259
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,680
because you're stressing them and um you

1260
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:33,558
know they're delicate and they could be

1261
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,759
quick to turn you know things can go bad

1262
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:39,760
pretty quick with the A Little Seedling

1263
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:42,480
so generally I recommend 250 to 350

1264
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:45,960
micromols for seedlings and that's

1265
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:48,440
plants up to about 2 3 weeks old so

1266
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,000
until they're like sort of 6 in high

1267
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:53,599
you're kind of getting little Woody

1268
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:57,358
branches you've got maybe four or five

1269
00:54:53,599 --> 00:55:00,480
um branches uh coming out on top of each

1270
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:02,838
other stacked um from then it's push

1271
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,760
them as hard as you can um as quickly as

1272
00:55:02,838 --> 00:55:07,480
you can and it it's all strain dependent

1273
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:11,000
so I try not to give a a definite number

1274
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:15,358
but you should be trying to get up to

1275
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:18,000
full par intensity by about week six

1276
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:20,119
somewhere around that region so from two

1277
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,798
or three weeks old you should be pushing

1278
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:26,960
on that um light intensity up

1279
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:29,960
incrementally to at least 80% um by week

1280
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:32,679
six um and possibly by 100% strain

1281
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:35,519
dependent as I said all you need to do

1282
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:39,558
is just keep an eye out for for light

1283
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:42,759
stress and light stress you know i' i'

1284
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:44,039
we get a lot of people um as a grow

1285
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:46,319
light supplier you know I get people

1286
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:49,520
coming back saying oh you know my PL

1287
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:53,239
it's burning my plants and um I tell

1288
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:56,358
them unless the plant is within 6 in of

1289
00:55:53,239 --> 00:55:57,479
the light bar and you're at 100% it is

1290
00:55:56,358 --> 00:56:01,078
not

1291
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:06,760
lightburn um I have grown plants you

1292
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:09,160
know within you know 4 in um at 100%

1293
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:11,599
where it's 3,000 micromols directly

1294
00:56:09,159 --> 00:56:13,480
under that light bar and they're still

1295
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:16,119
not light bur it needs to get up to that

1296
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:18,599
sort of at least above 2 and a half

1297
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:20,920
th000 maybe 3,000 micro moles before you

1298
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:23,000
start to see actual light burn and

1299
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,760
you'll know it because it'll only be on

1300
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,798
those spots which are very close to the

1301
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:29,920
light it won't be all AC Ross your

1302
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:31,519
canopy and quite often I'd see you know

1303
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,079
people would send me in pictures to sort

1304
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:36,480
of diagnose what the problem would be

1305
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,640
and you can see that all of the plant is

1306
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,240
affected it's not just these little

1307
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:43,598
Peaks here you know canopy isn't

1308
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:46,239
perfectly flat and it's not all getting

1309
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:48,680
exactly the same light intensity so if

1310
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:50,838
you are seeing spots directly under the

1311
00:56:48,679 --> 00:56:53,159
light or where the light is emitted

1312
00:56:50,838 --> 00:56:56,078
directly under the bars very close to

1313
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:59,639
the bars that probably is light stress

1314
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:03,160
and and raise the light that's all you

1315
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:04,759
need to do raise it 6 in um and just be

1316
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:06,920
sure that you're not causing that plant

1317
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:09,880
damage or bend that particular part over

1318
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:11,599
or trim it or you know whatever um but

1319
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:15,000
it's very rare that you would get light

1320
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:18,318
stress so it's far more likely that

1321
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,239
you're going to see other symptoms and

1322
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:22,759
it would be symptoms as a set of uh

1323
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:25,959
underwatering

1324
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,680
overwatering most of what I see is too

1325
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:30,639
much

1326
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:32,519
nutrients um that I that it's very hard

1327
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:35,400
to diagnose you know over a WhatsApp

1328
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:38,199
message or or an email photograph

1329
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:40,760
whatever but but from what

1330
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:42,838
I when I go through all of the different

1331
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:46,079
factors that the grower is is has in

1332
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:48,119
place uh quite often in my view it's um

1333
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:49,920
it's actually too much feeding all right

1334
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:52,000
good to know so I asked you this next

1335
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:55,838
question in our last episode back in

1336
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:58,239
2021 and it's been 3 years later now so

1337
00:57:55,838 --> 00:58:01,078
fig got to ask you again what does the

1338
00:57:58,239 --> 00:58:02,838
future look like for grow light

1339
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:05,240
technology yeah so I think as you were

1340
00:58:02,838 --> 00:58:10,519
saying earlier I think some of it will

1341
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:14,759
be about um our growing systems and

1342
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:18,159
it'll be having systems which understand

1343
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:22,520
and support higher growth rates overall

1344
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:27,239
so are dialed in to this sort of

1345
00:58:22,519 --> 00:58:29,159
12,400 micro average and um you know I

1346
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:30,318
was just over in mjbizcon I met you

1347
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:32,000
there and I was talking to a lot of

1348
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:34,440
commercial Growers there and that's

1349
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,639
pretty much or sorry grow lighting

1350
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,720
suppliers selling to commercial Growers

1351
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:40,118
and that's pretty much what they're

1352
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:42,639
specifying now is, 1400

1353
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:44,160
micromols uh and that's because they're

1354
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:47,838
getting a good return for it you know

1355
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:50,798
it's the best use of the space um and

1356
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:52,798
they're getting a good return so that's

1357
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:56,400
almost twice the power intensity that

1358
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:59,159
hom Growers are using today but you know

1359
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:02,280
if we figure out what strains are best

1360
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:05,000
suited if we figure out what sort of

1361
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:07,000
nutrient schedules should be used what

1362
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,920
sort of watering systems what sort of

1363
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,798
media Etc best support this high

1364
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:16,680
performance level I think it's perfectly

1365
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:18,920
achievable and um you know as as it

1366
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:20,679
would be a surprise to people six seven

1367
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:23,960
years ago who were running with metal

1368
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:27,038
Hall and HPS that were pushing you know

1369
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:28,679
in some cases twice the yeld for square

1370
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:31,680
foot that they would have been even

1371
00:59:28,679 --> 00:59:33,798
expert Growers um because of this incre

1372
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:35,960
light intensity I think they would be

1373
00:59:33,798 --> 00:59:38,318
surprised um and I think we'll be

1374
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:41,079
equally surprised 3 four years from now

1375
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:42,679
when we're looking back and and seeing

1376
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:45,440
all these little incremental sort of

1377
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:47,960
changes that have occurred to put

1378
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,639
systems into place to support that

1379
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,838
higher um return rate interesting yeah

1380
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:54,038
I'm trying to look into the future

1381
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:56,038
myself and see you know what is next for

1382
00:59:54,039 --> 00:59:57,839
grow lights and one of the things that

1383
00:59:56,039 --> 01:00:00,680
come to mind I'd like to see and I think

1384
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:02,558
it would be achievable in the future is

1385
01:00:00,679 --> 01:00:05,118
having AI Incorporated a little bit

1386
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:07,440
directly within the grow lights to where

1387
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:09,599
it can actually scan the plants and find

1388
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,240
out okay it needs more light it'll

1389
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,280
automatically adjust the light up to

1390
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:14,558
where it needs or if it's smart enough

1391
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,240
to know that there's deficiencies as

1392
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:17,319
well it's going to communicate to you

1393
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:20,038
and let you know that you need to

1394
01:00:17,318 --> 01:00:22,838
increase your nutrients or or whatever

1395
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:24,480
but um I think it probably could happen

1396
01:00:22,838 --> 01:00:26,599
at some point in the future maybe not in

1397
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,679
the next couple years but maybe 5 10

1398
01:00:26,599 --> 01:00:30,400
years from now we've got AI Incorporated

1399
01:00:28,679 --> 01:00:32,000
directly in the grow lights to where

1400
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,960
it's actually adjusting the light levels

1401
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,639
according to how the plants physically

1402
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,318
are well a really good example of that

1403
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:40,719
in just cheap sensor technology that

1404
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:44,639
works really well and U takes it away

1405
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:46,879
from sort of our perception or or

1406
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:49,199
whatever our experiences are before that

1407
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:52,440
may be misleading us and one of the ones

1408
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:56,000
for me is moisture sensors so you know I

1409
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:58,119
was growing in Coco I actually met um Dr

1410
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,798
Coco over MJ biscan he was giving out to

1411
01:00:58,119 --> 01:01:02,240
me because you know I hadn't been

1412
01:00:59,798 --> 01:01:06,000
following his methods

1413
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:07,358
properly and uh you know he he he was he

1414
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,079
was suggesting the same thing to me

1415
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:11,798
about using the moisture sensor I did

1416
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:15,039
and I have to say I was overwatering and

1417
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:18,559
I didn't realize it you know um and

1418
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:20,200
sensor technology is getting cheaper um

1419
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:23,280
the integration of these sensors is

1420
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:25,719
getting cheaper um you know really

1421
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:28,599
impressed uh with AC Infinity stuff for

1422
01:01:25,719 --> 01:01:30,480
examp example um where they've really

1423
01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:32,798
brought that the price down for

1424
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:35,358
integrating those systems together for

1425
01:01:32,798 --> 01:01:38,358
the hom grower um and made it much

1426
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:39,358
easier to use and taking it away from

1427
01:01:38,358 --> 01:01:43,279
our

1428
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:45,960
subjectivity from our um sort of biases

1429
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,280
based on past experience and or just

1430
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:51,039
lack of of

1431
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,440
knowledge and you know so whether it's

1432
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:56,839
helping you with nutrition and feed

1433
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:59,358
schedules helping you with uh you know

1434
01:01:56,838 --> 01:02:02,558
controlling your environment dialing all

1435
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:04,400
those little factors in to uh you know

1436
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:07,079
prevent us making a mess of things for a

1437
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,760
start which is which is always a bonus

1438
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:11,359
but then you know getting those extra 5%

1439
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,599
all over the place you know that those

1440
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:16,480
little five% they all increment together

1441
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:18,240
to make a good grow rather than um a

1442
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,559
disappointing grow which you know we've

1443
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:22,118
all had those experiences where you know

1444
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:23,720
we look back and we're just not sure

1445
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:25,358
what happened you know we're just not

1446
01:02:23,719 --> 01:02:26,358
sure why it went wrong what was

1447
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:27,920
different

1448
01:02:26,358 --> 01:02:30,278
I thought I did everything exactly the

1449
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:33,639
same and it turned out different and if

1450
01:02:30,278 --> 01:02:36,318
we had um as you say AI knitted into

1451
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:37,440
that where you know we're able to feed

1452
01:02:36,318 --> 01:02:40,480
inputs and

1453
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:43,278
outputs uh into a system where we're

1454
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:45,400
diarising things effectively online or

1455
01:02:43,278 --> 01:02:48,199
or through these um through these

1456
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:52,720
devices I think there's huge potential

1457
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:54,798
there to um prevent disasters uh or

1458
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:56,399
disappointments um and to boost

1459
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:58,278
performance yeah I think it can be

1460
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,519
really helpful for sure we will just

1461
01:02:58,278 --> 01:03:02,760
