section below and we're back welcome to

74
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,280
the Garden Talk podcast today I am

75
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,480
joined with Steven raisner how you doing

76
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,318
today good thanks for having me back

77
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:45,158
thanks for coming back we did one

78
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:47,359
episode in the past so some of you might

79
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:49,399
remember that one he goes by potent

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,720
ponics and last episode we talked all

81
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,800
about aquaponics which isn't a very

82
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,400
popular growing method but you can

83
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,640
definitely grow some really good plants

84
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,439
that way but this time we're going to

85
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,518
switch things around really going to

86
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,400
talk a lot about genetic diversity

87
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:03,959
and growing genetics the best way

88
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,158
possible for your climate you know

89
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,519
there's so many differences that can

90
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:08,079
happen you have so much experience

91
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:11,158
growing around the world really you've

92
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,040
been grown in different countries so I

93
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:14,359
think it's going to be a really good

94
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:17,039
conversation with you to kind of reveal

95
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,360
some information tips tricks and so on

96
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,120
and so forth but before we get too deep

97
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,599
into the episode can you introduce

98
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,319
yourself for the audience members who

99
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:27,679
don't know you sure my name is Steve um

100
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:29,158
I have a company called potent ponics I

101
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,280
also have a podcast called growing with

102
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:33,158
fishes um we've been around now for

103
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,400
eight years um so we've been making a

104
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:38,280
lot of awesome content uh similar to

105
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,719
yourself with a lot of you know similar

106
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,120
similar type uh structures but um my

107
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,560
main U work is uh doing consulting for

108
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,360
uh all different types of living soil

109
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,120
and aquaponic systems and farms uh all

110
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,280
around the world with a variety of crops

111
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,719
the majority of it being medicinal uh

112
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,598
plants are essential oil producing

113
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:57,359
plants and then the rest of it being

114
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,560
food production crops mainly organic

115
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,159
certified for the for the aquaponics um

116
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,000
there isn't a lot of people that can

117
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,560
come in and set up those types of

118
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,919
facilities or troubleshoot them when

119
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,719
they run into auditing problems um so we

120
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,798
do a lot of internal audits uh and um

121
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,158
mainly lately the last 5 years or so

122
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,600
going to different countries and setting

123
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,319
up large facilities um specking out the

124
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,479
equipment specking out the systems the

125
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:23,639
pumps the filtration you know P you know

126
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,079
setting up the different Sops and all

127
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,040
the different protocols and coming with

128
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:28,918
different solutions especially in in

129
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,639
Oddball places I'm sure we'll get into

130
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:31,799
some of them in a little B uh uh you

131
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,879
know learning different things in

132
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,280
different cultures and you know it seems

133
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,639
like every part of the world has like a

134
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,478
different piece of the puzzle really

135
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,038
figured out like to the unth degree and

136
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:44,478
uh it's always fun to um learn from

137
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:46,000
these different indigenous cultures uh

138
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:49,758
and kind of combine all that knowledge

139
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,839
into a a working system got it so like

140
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,280
what countries have you grown in or

141
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,638
areas have you grown in maybe I know a

142
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,839
might be quite a long list here maybe

143
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,000
just spitball off a handful of them sure

144
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:03,839
yeah so I've grown in Canada all across

145
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,759
the US Puerto Rico Jamaica um Zimbabwe

146
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:11,918
South Africa Thailand um Colombia um and

147
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:15,280
I'm sure I'm forgetting so oh St Vincent

148
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:18,719
and I've been to grows in swasiland or

149
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:21,799
east stini now uh as well

150
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,240
as sure I'm forgetting somewhere but uh

151
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,478
quite oh la I've seen some grows and La

152
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,360
as well Matt all over the place that

153
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:31,120
that's wild all right so let's first get

154
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,120
into genetic diversity break it down for

155
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,160
us what is meant by genetic diversity

156
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,199
sure so genetic diversity is kind of

157
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,919
what is the different phenotypic

158
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,800
expressions of the different plants in a

159
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:44,038
given region um so but also in mutations

160
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,759
as well you have things like freak Show

161
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:50,159
um uh ABC um and and uh crows foot is a

162
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,280
bunch of other ones as well that can be

163
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,520
genetic variation but U mainly what

164
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:54,959
we're going to talk about today is kind

165
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,439
of the differences between the different

166
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,159
land races uh and the different stuff

167
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,639
that was in you know different regions

168
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,800
um Jamaica for instance had very few it

169
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,519
was almost no land race left by the time

170
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,759
I was there in 2016 most of it had been

171
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,959
crossbred with Western you know poly

172
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,639
hybrid stuff they're really think maybe

173
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:18,680
one time did I see anything that was

174
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:20,598
even you know pretty uh natural looking

175
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,240
I guess for lack of a better term it

176
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:25,079
really surprised me because Jamaica was

177
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,840
always kind of known as being like this

178
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:28,800
really wild place but there's a lot of

179
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,478
cool genetics there but you know it's

180
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,560
almost all contaminated with Western

181
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,159
stuff now whereas when I was in Africa

182
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,478
especially like in remote parts of

183
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,439
Zimbabwe none of that stuff has seen any

184
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:42,639
kind of um you know uh uh outside

185
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,519
genetics because of the wars and the

186
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,478
isolation and the sanctions and all the

187
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,560
other stuff there isn't a big export

188
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:49,680
culture there right so they're not

189
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,519
bringing in different genetics in order

190
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,800
to to crossbreed for for export so

191
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,359
they're just growing what they like and

192
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,639
what's what's been growing there so um

193
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,520
it's always kind of interesting the

194
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,079
different motivations of the different

195
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:04,120
places um if you think about it this way

196
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,959
too why is it that the biggest places in

197
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,598
the world for the different genetic

198
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:10,279
diversities that are kind of known for

199
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:13,079
being these epicenters are Jamaica which

200
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:14,959
was a huge trade Hub in the Caribbean um

201
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,000
you know Durban which is a huge trade

202
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,120
Hub in in southern Africa especially the

203
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,199
the anywhere really where you had the

204
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,399
the um what was the name of it the East

205
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,840
Indies Trading Company or West Indies

206
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:27,038
Trading Company or whatever it was back

207
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,679
in the day um anywhere you know in the

208
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,399
17 1800s where you had a lot of this

209
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,160
heavy trade that's where you have a lot

210
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,799
of the kind of meccas for these genetics

211
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,800
Morocco being another one that was a big

212
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,360
trade Hub you know all these different

213
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,360
places that we kind of think of as being

214
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,160
like the best places to go and Source

215
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,000
out genetics most of them were huge

216
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,759
trade hubs and back in the day you know

217
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,240
from you know 1,00 through you know the

218
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,598
1800s you would keep you know hemp on

219
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,759
your your boat um as part of your sale

220
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,240
production in case you have a ship wreck

221
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,038
you know you can grow your own ropes and

222
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,000
sails and things like that um and uh uh

223
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,639
you know other plants as well uh

224
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,680
medically that they would grow to keep

225
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,918
as medicine on the pl on the boat and

226
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,759
that's why you have a lot of these

227
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,000
different really cool land races in the

228
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,400
specific regions that you have is

229
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
because it was part of your boat

230
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,038
standard boat repair kit for the better

231
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,720
part of a thousand years so if you did

232
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,800
any kind of long sea travel you brought

233
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,440
pine trees and you which is why you have

234
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,079
pine trees everywhere and also why they

235
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:24,319
call everything that you can make into a

236
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,878
mast a pine tree there's lots of non-

237
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,840
pine trees that are called pine trees as

238
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:29,720
a common name that's another reason for

239
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,839
it um you know there's all these

240
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,158
different stuff but but that's the

241
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:35,679
reason why you have that you know

242
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:38,038
epicenters of of genetics for medicinal

243
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,000
plants that we all enjoy is because of

244
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:41,519
that you know boat repair kit type stuff

245
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,399
and then people kind of growing large

246
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,839
volumes of that and kind of finding you

247
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,000
know through pheno hunting those those

248
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,839
better cultivars in those regions that's

249
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,120
interesting and yeah the medicinal

250
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,279
plants have been transferred all around

251
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,519
the world at this point really and some

252
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:58,439
genetics they might grow really well in

253
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,440
one area but they don't grow well at all

254
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,160
they actually can grow bad in other

255
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,120
areas why is that well a great example

256
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:07,360
of this would be you know Leaf width

257
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,679
right so in I just came back from living

258
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,720
in Thailand for almost a year uh the

259
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,439
really narrow Leaf varieties of plants

260
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,440
grow much much better uh in Thailand or

261
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,000
anywhere in the tropics um freak Show

262
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,160
would be another one that does extremely

263
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,519
well because the reduce reduced Leaf

264
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,958
surface uh in the hot sun they don't get

265
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,879
heated up as much uh and they don't have

266
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,679
to sweat as much and drink as much water

267
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,759
not sweat but you know respirate through

268
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:31,399
this

269
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,240
um they're not losing as much water per

270
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,320
day because they have a reduced surface

271
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,839
area so they can grow much easier and

272
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,079
have a lot less heat stress whereas if

273
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,839
you take a broad leaf like a a plant

274
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:44,639
that came from a much more Northern

275
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,920
climate um you're going to have you know

276
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,278
instant Leaf burn you're going to get

277
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,399
sunburn those plants are going to have

278
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,958
to work a lot harder to bring up more

279
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,839
water because they're losing more water

280
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,439
per day through the leaf structure uh

281
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:55,839
and it really can U make a big

282
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,760
difference but that's the you know I

283
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,839
guess the biggest reason why you would

284
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,159
choose one or the other or kind of the

285
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,839
biggest things to look for when you're

286
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:04,799
growing in the tropics versus growing in

287
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,200
Northern climates Northern climates

288
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,958
doesn't matter if it's narrow leaf or

289
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,519
Broad Leaf anywhere near as much if

290
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:12,759
you're going in the tropics you know if

291
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:16,078
I take a a you know Broad Leaf

292
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:18,278
um uh you know variety it's just not

293
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,838
going to do well and we even saw saw

294
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:21,720
that um in a lot of the genetics we were

295
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,360
testing there you know uh anything that

296
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,800
was super super broadleaf a lot of

297
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,039
blueberry and things like that just

298
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,719
fried in the sun um because it just

299
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,159
couldn't handle it so definitely and the

300
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,920
freak Show really is one of the best

301
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:34,879
ones if you're going to grow in full sun

302
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:36,278
in a really really brutally hot climate

303
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,000
it really really is one of the best

304
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:40,480
Durban would be another one that grows

305
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,360
extremely well does not care if it's 105

306
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,480
out we'll do just fine you know most

307
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,120
cases okay now can these genetics adapt

308
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,920
to different climates for example could

309
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,360
you take a broad leaf from the northern

310
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,519
climate bring it down to the tropics and

311
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,159
then have it grow naturally let's say

312
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:59,440
let's say it's out in the wild outside

313
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:01,958
and over 20 years let's say 20 years

314
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,279
later will that genetic adapt or will

315
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:06,159
you just see poor growth for that 20e

316
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:08,159
period Well I think you definitely could

317
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,759
have you know some level of adaptation

318
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,759
if you could get them to finish off you

319
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,278
know in a lot of cases the plants don't

320
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,879
make it all the way to harvest because

321
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,720
of this the Heat and the stress and all

322
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,720
the rest or you know past pressure

323
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,920
that's another one too like for instance

324
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,320
when I was in Thailand you know if

325
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:24,519
you're in the marier areas or the rice

326
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,360
fields like where I was growing

327
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:30,440
initially um those are all almost lemine

328
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,079
dominant completely um terms of of chemo

329
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,880
profile um and that lemoning really does

330
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:36,719
help get rid of those bugs that kind of

331
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,078
like that environment more whereas in

332
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,519
the mountains you get more of the

333
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:43,799
chocolates and the mangoes some of the

334
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:46,839
other you know funky Sandalwood um type

335
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:49,519
type uh turpine profiles and that really

336
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,880
H is more adapted to like the white fly

337
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,240
and the other different pests that are

338
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,159
up there that's the plants that are

339
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,959
surviving and not getting eaten by the

340
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,838
bug so that that plays a huge role in

341
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,278
that turpine expression as well as well

342
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:02,240
as what's going to survive and not

343
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:03,759
survive you know um you know that's

344
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,360
that's the other component to it aside

345
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,039
from just the climate is that you know

346
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,200
if it doesn't if it has a c now another

347
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,120
one too I was at a couple two different

348
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,120
facilities and I've seen thrips

349
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,919
specifically feeding on pineapple um

350
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,560
flavored varieties eating all of the um

351
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:22,000
pests off of the plants so they eat just

352
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:23,439
the pests off which is really weird it's

353
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,679
good if you don't want pollination I

354
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,360
guess but uh uh they would just crawl up

355
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,919
to the top eat all the pests and then go

356
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,320
back off the planet it was the weirdest

357
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:32,439
thing but I've seen that on two separate

358
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,320
occasions specifically with pineapple

359
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,279
flavored varieties so sometimes you even

360
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,399
just get a pest that that really cues in

361
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:40,120
on one or two cultivars and you just

362
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,000
can't grow those particular cultivars

363
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,120
because the pests are they like magnets

364
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
to them so you know and other times too

365
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,799
hey if those couple of plants are going

366
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,559
to take all my bugs off of the rest of

367
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:51,399
the plants that's fine I'll sacrifice

368
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:53,000
those and and we'll just you know

369
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:54,879
sacrifice those to the Lord of light at

370
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,198
the end of the season uh like we do our

371
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,320
ticks that we find on ourselves yeah

372
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:00,838
sacrificial plants this can be uh handy

373
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,519
I know some people grow plants

374
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,160
specifically for that you know to try to

375
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,600
attract pest to those so the other

376
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,958
plants can grow well I want to get

377
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,720
deeper into the different areas you've

378
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,399
personally grown in have you tried to

379
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,839
like transfer genetics from one area to

380
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,198
another and just seen a poor result or

381
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:16,880
had a good result yeah no every

382
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:18,559
everywhere I've go we found ways to get

383
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:21,360
the genetics there I was the first legal

384
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,638
person to import seeds to Zimbabwe um

385
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,399
and we went to go pick up the seeds at

386
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:28,079
the airport and uh I don't know if I

387
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:29,679
told you this story or not but uh uh we

388
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:31,159
went to go pick up the seeds I had all

389
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,719
my paperwork from the you know the

390
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:35,958
health department and they're like

391
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,160
you're here to pick up seeds like yeah

392
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,599
you're going to get arrested like

393
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:40,000
whatever like give us your paperwork and

394
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,480
he checked in and it had the SE right

395
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,159
seals on it and stuff so he goes up to

396
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,320
his boss comes back down and he um puts

397
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:49,439
the box out with all the other boxes to

398
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,440
kind of like test their dogs this is cuz

399
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,320
they're having fun with it now once

400
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,839
everything's on the up and up and then

401
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,600
they put take it out and they search

402
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,079
around the dogs don't hit on the box and

403
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,120
they went from being really chummy to

404
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:02,638
like really pissed off uh so that was a

405
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,120
that was a pretty scary few minutes

406
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,480
until we could get the box and get out

407
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,278
of the airport but uh that was that was

408
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,199
really fun but um I've grown a lot of

409
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:12,600
different places and I would say that

410
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,240
the only time we've really had a lot of

411
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:19,320
negative issues was well partially was

412
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:23,399
trying to get CBD and CBG cultivar to um

413
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:25,680
grow in uh the uh the tropics so those

414
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,799
in particular were were very difficult

415
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,879
uh because the Heat and the natural

416
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,078
higher manganese in Zimbabwe in

417
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,720
particular um has a really high base

418
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:36,719
level of manganese in the soil and if

419
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,519
you have high manganese that tends to

420
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,040
really increase the um expression of

421
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,240
other particular compounds that you

422
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:49,120
don't want if you're trying to grow for

423
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,440
for you know EU compliant cultivar so um

424
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,519
it kind of pushes that outside of the

425
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,720
range so between that and the heat um

426
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:57,839
you know it kind of causes you to always

427
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,320
test hot so that was a big problem um

428
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,880
that was really hard to kind of deal

429
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,560
with and the end of the day we real

430
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,799
Ended as selecting through through

431
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,119
phenotypic and and cultiv our selection

432
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,120
finding the right ones for that but it

433
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,839
did take you know we got to get rid of

434
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,839
about 40% of them because they just were

435
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,440
always testing hot you know for for the

436
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,040
compliance that we had to grow for for

437
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,279
that particular customer but um that was

438
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,879
the only time we ever really had a ton

439
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:22,000
of problems with the cultivar

440
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:23,360
specifically I mean you always have a

441
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,839
percentage of what you're going to try

442
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,839
to grow there is just going to hate that

443
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,720
climate and just do crappy and you just

444
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:29,759
have that's part of the game right you

445
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,519
matter what you're trying to do there's

446
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,720
always going to be a certain percentage

447
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,440
of of genetics that are just going to

448
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,399
not like your particular grow method no

449
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,959
matter what you're doing um so that's a

450
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,240
big part of it and then also too just

451
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:42,198
making sure that you can kind of get the

452
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,720
the biocurity that you need in a lot of

453
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:46,159
these facilities they're used to Growing

454
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,480
traditionally and that can be a big big

455
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:51,799
difficulty but that was kind of the

456
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,560
biggest problems now in Jamaica there um

457
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:54,958
nothing really gets that large very few

458
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:57,399
of the genetics I've seen that were

459
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,359
really growing in the Hills you know get

460
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,159
much above 3 or 4 ft tall so you're not

461
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,480
getting that much yield per plant um so

462
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,759
that was definitely another issue and

463
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,879
you're going to go with much more denser

464
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,759
planting um I have some videos and stuff

465
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:11,360
on it on my YouTube of of what that

466
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,120
looks like in the Hills above uh uh out

467
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,560
in West Morland um I have a lot of good

468
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,959
friends down there I always love going

469
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:17,879
down to the island uh and uh and hanging

470
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,318
out and seeing a bunch of the

471
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,519
traditional grows I got lots of good

472
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:23,599
homies down there and spend a lot of

473
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:25,440
time down there now in um Zimbabwe

474
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,639
Zimbabwe was really weird because we had

475
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,560
a lot of um you know traditional

476
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:32,000
rosarian grow that just were growing

477
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,599
gigantic trees and they didn't care if

478
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,318
it was taking six or eight months in

479
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,159
fact the uh best pining cultivars I've

480
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:41,599
ever had were and I still have um are

481
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:44,159
from the hills of nyanga uh up kind of

482
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,879
on the mosan Beek um Zimbabwe border

483
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,439
there's a ton of incredible genetics

484
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,919
there that have totally uncontaminated

485
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,880
still um and I think that kind of

486
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,318
subsaharan Africa is kind of The Last

487
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:57,799
Place on Earth that aside from maybe the

488
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:59,919
Himalayas that has a lot of untouched uh

489
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:01,719
genetics that haven't been contaminated

490
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:04,918
yet um it's the only place I've seen a

491
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:07,199
lot of genetics was was in Zimbabwe and

492
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,679
and you know on the border of mosan Beek

493
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,000
there um hands down like I don't think I

494
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,880
saw anything that had any kind of

495
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,558
Western structure to it it was very very

496
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,439
nice you know gigantic you know candal

497
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:20,199
abas uh um and uh what was interesting

498
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,240
there is they brag about how many snakes

499
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,079
you get on it so like if you have a lot

500
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,759
of snakes on your your plants the snakes

501
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,558
will rub themselves on the resin glands

502
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,440
to get rid of ticks and things like that

503
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,359
because it makes them they don't like

504
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,798
the resin right so um it's like a

505
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:36,240
bragging rights if you have like uh lots

506
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,240
of snakes in your grow which I thought

507
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,480
was a bit insane considering the species

508
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,440
there but um you know you have to deal

509
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,079
with green mambas and stuff I'm I'm not

510
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,360
down for finding snakes in the in the

511
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:49,480
grow that's crazy yeah I've never heard

512
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,439
that before that's that's pretty wild so

513
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,558
you mentioned like a percent of genetics

514
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,880
kind of not working out for the average

515
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:58,440
hom grower what would you say like if

516
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,679
they're ordering seeds online from say

517
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,320
different country or whatever and they

518
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,400
get it and they try to grow them within

519
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,359
their home grow indoor setup what

520
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,360
percentage of genetics would you say

521
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:12,359
won't work out I would just say um you

522
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,000
know avoid stuff that's from the tropics

523
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:17,158
that gets large that's going to be the

524
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,400
number one thing like um we recently had

525
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:22,440
the temple tie that I did a a collab

526
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,919
with with with Jordan um on uh on

527
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,200
growcast and we released a bunch of

528
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,679
those gentics and the the biggest issue

529
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,720
with those they get you know 10t tall by

530
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,400
week N9 from germination where you going

531
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,360
to grow that in a tent right you need to

532
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,519
hack the crap out of it to grow Stu so

533
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:38,119
avoid those types of cultivars you know

534
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:40,639
a lot of your traditional trop

535
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:43,038
equatorial land race stuff not going to

536
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,759
really do well indoors or you know maybe

537
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,679
start it indoors and then finish it

538
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:49,279
outside kind of thing if you're going to

539
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,080
do that um that's going to be your

540
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:54,279
biggest you know challenge every you

541
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:56,279
know otherwise just if you do decide to

542
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:58,519
take them on just prune the living crap

543
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:00,359
out of them make sure you know every for

544
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:02,679
to 8 days you are doing some type of

545
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:05,359
light trim on it to keep them manageable

546
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:07,000
in size or train them or you know super

547
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,879
crop them or whatever it is you need to

548
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,558
do to keep them inside your space and

549
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,520
also to remember like most cultivars

550
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:15,918
with a few exceptions kind of stop

551
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,558
growing after about 24 to 30 days in

552
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,679
terms of stretching once you flip their

553
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:23,319
life cycle so you know keep in mind that

554
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,640
plant might grow another you know 2 feet

555
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:28,079
3 feet on some of these more equatorial

556
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,000
strains that don't queue in quite as

557
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,558
head hard is some of the the northern

558
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,400
strains that are a little more used to

559
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:35,720
to queuing in on that indoor 1212 um you

560
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,559
know sometimes it can take them a little

561
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,640
longer and if you have you know you

562
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:40,558
don't want that thing to be growing up

563
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,240
into the lights and and not haven't even

564
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,879
flipped yet you know I've seen people do

565
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,679
that too and just have to totally make

566
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,440
like baskets out of the room you know

567
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,880
and correct me if I'm wrong but the

568
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,279
genetics that are down in the tropics

569
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:56,440
are more longer flowering strains right

570
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:58,119
so looking at 11 12 13 plus weers

571
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,759
sometimes down there is that right oh

572
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:01,239
yeah yeah and even longer you know I

573
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,839
there's definitely some cultivar I've

574
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,679
seen both in Africa especially in Africa

575
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,240
and to a less extent in Thailand you

576
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,759
know that can take you you know four or

577
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,359
five months of flower um and a real real

578
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:12,640
long time to actually finish off what

579
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,479
also is interesting is a lot of the

580
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,240
equatorial varieties have a minimum time

581
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,360
too so they have like they're going to

582
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,240
veg for two months or 3 months no matter

583
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:23,158
if you start them in 1212 or not like

584
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,558
the the temple tie that I have um

585
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:27,400
absolutely like it's going to get to 10

586
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,918
ft tall no matter what unless you are

587
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,400
hacking the crap out of it even if it's

588
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:35,038
under 1212 or even 1111 um you know or

589
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,159
1113 rather uh it's still going to grow

590
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:39,359
like you know absolute Gang Busters and

591
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:41,799
just ignore the fact that it's you know

592
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,959
50/50 because it's the the it strain

593
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:45,879
grew up the whole time and the you know

594
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,279
equator right so it's going to it's used

595
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,679
to that 12 hours and 12 hours so it has

596
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:51,200
kind of a minimum flowering time now

597
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,038
what's cool about it is some of them

598
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,480
once you're past that time you can take

599
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,919
cuts of them and they'll finish in you

600
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,679
know 9 to 12 weeks which is not that

601
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:00,240
much far off from a lot of your typical

602
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,400
cultivars I know a lot of stuff now is

603
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,359
eight weeks but most stuff is really N9

604
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,840
or 10 um if it's really good so a lot of

605
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:09,399
them can still fall into that range but

606
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,119
you're going to have to veg it for like

607
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,720
you know four or five months before you

608
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:14,079
know that Mom before you could really do

609
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,038
anything with it in terms of quick flet

610
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:17,359
fing so that's another thing to take

611
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:18,599
into account too with the equatorial and

612
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,439
I don't hear people talk about it as

613
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,240
much the other one that I've noticed too

614
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,798
is with the equatorial stuff and to a

615
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,240
lesser extent with the CBD lines as well

616
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,679
if you keep them under 24 hours of light

617
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,079
it causes herming and and a lot of like

618
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:35,559
hormonal problems where I'll get nanners

619
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:38,480
on them if I have them under 24 hours of

620
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:41,720
light for veg but if I flip them and

621
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,919
just do a 1212 or even 16 and8 U I don't

622
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,798
have any of those issues like the

623
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:46,440
nanners Stop and they never come back I

624
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:48,599
don't have any flowering problems with

625
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,080
them throwing nanners it's just that

626
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:53,038
like stress of not sleeping um I've

627
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:56,240
noticed particularly in land race as

628
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:58,759
well as CBD in particular seem to really

629
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,200
you know heavily fall into that um that

630
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:01,720
range where it's going to be a huge

631
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,880
problem for you I haven't heard that

632
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,079
before that's pretty interesting yeah

633
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,440
I've gotten myself into a little bit of

634
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:10,720
hot water I guess just to S kind of IGN

635
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,278
I don't say ignoring flowering time but

636
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,640
like I grow a whole whole bunch of

637
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:16,798
different cultivars in the same tent and

638
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,759
you know I didn't really look at the

639
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,599
flowering time too deeply on one of the

640
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:24,400
cultivars it was actually Hades thrown

641
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:25,839
by Zaza genetics sh out to ZaZa and uh

642
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,440
this one went for like 12 weeks

643
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:29,558
everything else finished in 8 n and so

644
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,159
this one was just lagging Beyond and I

645
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:33,480
knew something was up once I flipped a

646
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:35,278
flowering and it was stretching and

647
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,919
stretching and stretching and then 4

648
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:40,159
weeks into it it's like still grow I'm

649
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,640
like what the heck I'm like oh great

650
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,559
that at that point I knew it was longer

651
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,759
flowering and so like I thought it was a

652
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:47,000
really good tip what you mentioned is

653
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:49,158
like yeah be aware of this stuff right

654
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,558
like plan around it because you could

655
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,320
get your hands on some genetics and they

656
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,000
may sound good but if you're not look at

657
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,960
the flowering time that could really

658
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,319
throw your grow a little sideways if

659
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,600
you're someone like me who was growing a

660
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:00,399
whole whole bunch of different plants in

661
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:01,798
one grow space well you could have a

662
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,320
whole bunch of plants finished first

663
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:05,359
then have this one plant lagging could

664
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:06,798
throw off your whole grow cycle really

665
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,558
the other thing I would mention too is

666
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:11,240
like if you have zamal which is The

667
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:13,000
Reunion Island R land race which very

668
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,319
few people actually have but I'm one of

669
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,519
the people that managed to get my hands

670
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:19,119
on some um shout out the the woman who

671
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:22,440
gave me those she knows who she who it

672
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,959
was um uh the other one that I've seen

673
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,159
with the same trait is freak Show in

674
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:29,720
Thailand a friend of mine canai um he

675
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:32,400
has a really good um

676
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,919
uh cultivar of freak show that does the

677
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,440
same thing but um those two strains I've

678
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:40,120
seen or heard of them in the case of the

679
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,200
the zamal The Reunion Island land race

680
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:44,319
um are actually can continue to grow

681
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,278
post flower right so they'll just reveg

682
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:48,119
and then flower again reveg and flower

683
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:49,640
again and keep going back and forth

684
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:51,759
between those two states so you can grow

685
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,200
them you know kind of perennially

686
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:55,519
without having to harvest the whole

687
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,640
plant back which is unique there's very

688
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:00,278
few plants in the whole Jean Pool that

689
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,720
have that mutation so I've only seen in

690
00:24:00,278 --> 00:24:03,960
person the freak Show do it but I also

691
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,480
know that a lot of people claim that

692
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,519
zamal does it as well um but that's kind

693
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,400
of something where hey if you're going

694
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,960
to do that you know you have a big

695
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,000
structured plant and you're growing it

696
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,360
indoors that's kind of a problem if

697
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,960
you're in the tropics and you can just

698
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:17,240
let it grow in your yard all day like

699
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,319
that's not a problem right that's

700
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,159
actually a benefit so you know kind of

701
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:22,960
dialing in what exactly what it is you

702
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,480
want to do and you want from the plant

703
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,519
and the size of the plants that you want

704
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,440
for your particular indoor grow is going

705
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:31,000
to be a big factor into what your you

706
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,519
know selection is really good point I

707
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,119
want to Circle back to Pest Control

708
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,759
challenges what Pest Control challenges

709
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:40,079
have you faced growing in different

710
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:43,558
areas and do you have any tips for just

711
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:45,558
general I guess IPM or or pest control

712
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:48,079
that do Growers can take away yeah

713
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:50,359
there's quite a bit to this one so um

714
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,119
when I was in Jamaica for instance in

715
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:53,398
May and Puerto Rico is the same way

716
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:55,000
anywhere in the Caribbean anyone that's

717
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:57,798
growing there knows this um you have

718
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,240
butterfly season so all the butterfli

719
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:01,558
basically not all of them but it feels

720
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,640
like all of them like 60% of the

721
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:06,918
butterfly species all have like lay eggs

722
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,360
at once in April so they all hatch out

723
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:10,679
and you have this swarm of butterflies

724
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,158
that are all looking to lay eggs all

725
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:14,559
over everything in May in particular and

726
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:16,600
and anywhere in the Caribbean it's a

727
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,918
huge pain in the butt so but if you know

728
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:21,359
that that's coming you can get ready in

729
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:23,880
March and kind of keep BT on your plants

730
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,519
in March and April and and kind of head

731
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,799
that off so that as soon as they're on

732
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,759
the plants there's something already

733
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:30,558
working to get rid of them so that's the

734
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:32,319
kind of thing where once you've been

735
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,480
through a place through a full year or

736
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,038
even talking to local farmers hey what

737
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,120
do I need to worry about in the next 3

738
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:39,038
months what we need to worry about the

739
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,678
next four months and kind of learning

740
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,119
from the locals and what's often times

741
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,480
in the most of the world it's the women

742
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:45,759
that know all that stuff it's not the

743
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,720
men the men are the ones off running you

744
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,398
know fixing the tractors driving doing

745
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,960
all the other stuff it's the women in in

746
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:52,558
Africa and the Caribbean and many of

747
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,159
these other places that are the ones

748
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:55,678
actually working with the plant so

749
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,440
they're always the you know finding the

750
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,480
old wise wom in town is the one you need

751
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,240
to talk to 90% of the time in a lot of

752
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,558
these different you know especially more

753
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,759
Far Far Away places if you're really

754
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:07,038
want to get the good agriculture

755
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:08,919
information we had 80% women working in

756
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,558
Zimbabwe with us and they were teaching

757
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:12,440
us all kinds of cool stuff in terms of

758
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,319
identification uh another great trick

759
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,480
for identifying um especially in a large

760
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:19,639
scale for caterpillars is go out at

761
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,319
night with a black light um the

762
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,799
caterpillars and a lot of other insects

763
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:24,278
will glow like little Christmas

764
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,960
ornaments on your plants and they're

765
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:28,679
really easy to spot and Scout um that's

766
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,720
why especially in the summertime I'll

767
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,640
switch my work cruise to in you know

768
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,960
June through August to work at night

769
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,320
time you know we'll start off at 1:00 or

770
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,200
2: a.m. and then finish up by like 11:

771
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:39,398
or noon so that if it's going to be 100

772
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,000
you know whatever in the middle of the

773
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:42,519
day we're finishing up right as it's

774
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,119
getting hot you know same thing anywhere

775
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,720
where it's going to be brutal it's kind

776
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:47,239
of the work schedule you have to do but

777
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,759
what's cool is it makes it super easy to

778
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,000
start the day by scouting with black

779
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:52,519
lights and uh you know looking around

780
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,759
and seeing what what the heck is going

781
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:55,960
on in the field um so that was a great

782
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:58,879
way to kind of deal with a lot of those

783
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,880
issues in Jamaica um in Zimbabwe we ran

784
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,120
into some new issues that I hadn't run

785
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,080
into before so we had large locusts uh

786
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:08,398
and grasshoppers that would come in and

787
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:09,798
eat the center Cambrian layer of the

788
00:27:08,398 --> 00:27:12,199
plant so they go up about a foot and a

789
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:14,319
half 2 feet high eat all the bark off

790
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,720
and then the plants will just flop over

791
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:17,439
right and it's like what do you do

792
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,919
against that and there's you know we're

793
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,840
getting overrun and this all happened

794
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,320
right when covid hit the South Africa so

795
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:26,359
they immediately sealed all the borders

796
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,319
with South Africa and South Africa is

797
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:30,199
where we the only place we could import

798
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,079
bio controls from right so that we could

799
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,399
use for resell into Western markets

800
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:35,798
because that was the goal was to export

801
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:38,398
all the flour so we have basically got

802
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:40,240
cut off from all of our supply and I'm

803
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:42,879
getting overrun by bugs so I call out

804
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,319
Chris Trump and I was like hey man I'm

805
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,080
kind of panicking I don't know what to

806
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,158
do right now can you give me some ideas

807
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:50,119
on like something I can make because I

808
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,320
am like cut off from the outside world I

809
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:54,278
can't import anything now because they

810
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:55,798
have like a you know all the borders are

811
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:58,038
shut now for bringing in anything

812
00:27:55,798 --> 00:28:01,440
because of Co and he

813
00:27:58,038 --> 00:28:05,158
told me about a method where he had um

814
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,558
he did an IMO 3 to four and in the brand

815
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,559
he had a bunch of weevils that had

816
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:11,359
gotten into the brand and he inoculated

817
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:14,240
it with this Weevil brand you know

818
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:17,319
infected brand and what happened is the

819
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,880
the Weevil got uh or flea beetles or

820
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:23,519
whatever it was in there got um infected

821
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,080
with the uh the fungi from the IMO that

822
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,558
that liked to kill them basically the

823
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:30,480
wild equivalent of a bab basana or

824
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:32,158
iseria fumier um that or whatever is

825
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,880
Corps fumier now I think they just

826
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,440
changed the name of it um they're always

827
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,278
changing the name of the bio controls

828
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,080
just to confuse the crap out of the pest

829
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:41,119
control people I swear to uh anyways um

830
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:43,319
that they were looked like little

831
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,719
popcorn kernels cuz they were covered in

832
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:48,759
fungi so he was like Hey this works

833
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,880
really good on the the the macadamia nut

834
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:52,200
trees for getting rid of the weevils you

835
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,480
know we KN we kind of been screwing

836
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,558
around with it but I haven't had anybody

837
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,880
to really test it on like a bigger scale

838
00:28:55,558 --> 00:29:00,720
so we went ahead and I we paid a bunch

839
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,640
of the kids like like a nickel for every

840
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,120
10 or 20 grasshoppers they could find

841
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,360
and we had all the little village kids

842
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:07,038
running around getting all the

843
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,719
Grasshoppers they could into buckets for

844
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:12,960
us and um we took that we did a bunch of

845
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,240
IMO collections with IPO so this is the

846
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,720
recipe for this and it's something I

847
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,440
think anybody doing gardening uh should

848
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,480
really you know adopt this practice CU

849
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,240
it's really really good it works on a

850
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,399
really wide range of insects

851
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:29,079
grasshoppers um blister beetles Japanese

852
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:30,719
beetles Leaf hoppers um stink bugs like

853
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:33,359
a lot of stuff that's really hard to

854
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,200
treat normally um gr caterpillars and

855
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,038
gra uh and butterflies works really good

856
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,679
on these guys too um it will kill your

857
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:40,519
bees though if you spray them directly

858
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:42,960
with it it will infect them so it won't

859
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:45,399
take out your hive but if you spray them

860
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,640
and directly apply it um onto the bees

861
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:49,000
it will kill them so just make sure that

862
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,399
maybe you apply them in the evening when

863
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,880
the bees have already roosted if you if

864
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:53,798
you are keeping bees at home just to be

865
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,799
on the safe side it's just precaution on

866
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:57,918
that so uh if you're familiar with IMO

867
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:59,879
um and we'll we'll go through it and

868
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,919
assume that you aren't first you're

869
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,799
going to weigh about 700 g of rice and

870
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:07,080
put that into a bowl next you're going

871
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:09,879
to take 300 G of your locally collected

872
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:12,278
insects or purchased insect FR or go to

873
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,720
your local pet shop or farm store and

874
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:17,798
buy meal worms or crickets or some other

875
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,519
local insect is or take a light bulb and

876
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:21,278
put it above a bucket outside and just

877
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,200
let all the local bugs fall into it and

878
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:26,159
strain that and just try to get about

879
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,679
300 G of insect FR or bugs alternatively

880
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,760
you can use crab meal or Lobster meal if

881
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:33,159
you have to uh if you're in a

882
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:35,599
pinch next you're going to mix those two

883
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:37,480
together until you have a nice uh insect

884
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:41,119
infused rice mix then you're going to

885
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:43,798
cook the together combined in a in a pot

886
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:45,599
until it's about 80 to 85% finished with

887
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:48,879
the rice till it's a little bit stiff

888
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:50,119
still but not totally soft yet then

889
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,960
you're going to take that finished

890
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:56,959
cooked mix and you're going to put it

891
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:58,639
into a open um uh open weave basket that

892
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,440
has a a lot of holes in it and air can

893
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:01,839
flow through it really well uh and

894
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,759
you're going to put a good four or five

895
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,638
in layer uh in the bottom of that basket

896
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:09,038
then you're going to take a piece of uh

897
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:10,479
open screen uh and doesn't matter any

898
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:11,879
kind of screen will work or you can even

899
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,480
just take a piece of string and weave it

900
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,559
across the top um you just need to make

901
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,200
a cover for it that air can pass through

902
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:19,278
but you don't want to keep let the local

903
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,120
dogs or cats or squirrels or whatever

904
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,480
else Forest creatures into it um okay so

905
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:25,239
now you have your basket that has a

906
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,599
little screen on top now you're going to

907
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,000
take your basket full of uh your your

908
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,599
starter and you're going to put that out

909
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,919
into the forest or a part of your

910
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:34,719
property that has a lot of Duff or Leaf

911
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:36,278
litter or you know an area where it's

912
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,798
kind of naturally composting like you

913
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:40,480
would in a forest um the older the area

914
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:42,798
that's and the healthier the area the

915
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,839
better you know uh I like to do a good

916
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:46,798
you know 10 to 20 collections at a time

917
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:48,000
when I do this because you can combine

918
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:49,960
all of them and kind of get the

919
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
different microbial colonies from around

920
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,240
the different

921
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,759
area uh you're going to set that basket

922
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,638
out uh into your forested area and then

923
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:59,798
you're going to put a cover on top so

924
00:31:57,638 --> 00:32:01,798
not directly on top of the basket but

925
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:03,480
you know a good foot and a/ half 2 ft

926
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:06,398
above it you're going to put a plastic

927
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,880
bag or an old dog food bag or a trash

928
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:09,759
bag whatever you can it just keeps the

929
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,600
rain from falling onto the rice the rice

930
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:13,200
doesn't get any more wet right you just

931
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,558
want to have it kind of like damp but

932
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,600
not soaking

933
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:18,918
wet uh then you're going to look around

934
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:20,558
the forest and see if you can find any

935
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:23,240
um pieces of branches or anything that

936
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:25,558
have a little um uh micro Riza on it and

937
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,839
just drop two or three of those or or

938
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:29,000
you know four or five if you want to

939
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:30,319
into the top of your basket just uh you

940
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
know underneath the screen so that you

941
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:33,599
do have a little bit of an inoculant

942
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,079
going on there now what's going to

943
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,319
happen is uh you're going to leave it

944
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:39,079
out there for 5 days I know maybe six if

945
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:40,678
it's a little bit cooler if it's really

946
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:42,398
hot you can sometimes get away with four

947
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,399
days but usually 5 to six days is what

948
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:46,079
it takes to do the collection now what

949
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:48,879
happens is you're collecting the natural

950
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,398
fungi that feed on the rice but also

951
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,880
that feed on the insect corpses

952
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:56,479
basically the kiten kiten feeding

953
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,200
insects um or no sorry uh kiten feeding

954
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,079
fungi that that feed on the

955
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,880
insects so um you're kind of capturing

956
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:06,278
all the local equivalents of Bavaria

957
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,799
basana and saer fumasi and all these

958
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:09,679
other bio controls that you're making at

959
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:11,759
home but you're Gathering whatever the

960
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,798
local species is from your particular

961
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,278
property or your particular region so

962
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:17,119
that when you apply this in your garden

963
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:19,000
you don't have to worry about you know

964
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:20,479
contaminating the ground or worry about

965
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,638
runoff or worry about if your kids

966
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,159
running through the garden while you're

967
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:25,678
spraying or if your dog runs by you uh

968
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,559
or if it drinks from the container it's

969
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,960
no big deal I can drink this stuff which

970
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:32,278
is cool so now your your basket's been

971
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,798
out there for 5 days you have your nice

972
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:36,398
solid block of fungi uh it's going to be

973
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,158
white maybe a little yellow maybe a

974
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:39,678
little bit of green in there but for the

975
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,679
most part it should be white or most you

976
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,480
know 80% plus white you're going to take

977
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:46,278
the basket back uh and then you're going

978
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,759
to take all of your different fungal

979
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:49,720
blocks that you have check them make

980
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,278
sure they're not all green if it's all

981
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,038
green it's gone to tricoderma now

982
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:54,398
trichoderma is good in some cases if you

983
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:56,119
got a fungal outbreak or whatever you

984
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:57,719
can culture that trichoderma and

985
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:00,759
absolutely use that that if you have you

986
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,600
know 50 a root rot or some other you

987
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:04,679
know powdery milde something like that

988
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:06,678
if you have to but we're not trying to

989
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:08,200
to collect the tri tricoderma tricoderma

990
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:09,599
can be a little too aggressive and it

991
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:12,078
can wipe out a lot of your other

992
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,960
beneficials if you use too much of it so

993
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,679
uh uh if it's too much green throw it

994
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:19,280
away um if it's not all green it's all

995
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,358
nice and white or white and yellow take

996
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,159
that and you're going to weigh it all

997
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:24,000
and put all the good collections into a

998
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,559
bucket you know if you put out 20 of

999
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,679
them you should get at least you know

1000
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:29,078
seven or eight of them that are keepers

1001
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,878
um you know if you get more than that

1002
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:32,240
then great but you know don't feel bad

1003
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:33,519
if you only get one or two that's

1004
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,559
perfectly fine that's all you really

1005
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,398
need so now you're going to weigh all of

1006
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:40,159
that collectively so let's just say that

1007
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:43,598
that we had uh 3 kilog of it so we have

1008
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:46,440
3,000 gam that we had saved now we're

1009
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,000
going to weigh 3,000 gam of brown sugar

1010
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,519
and we're going to combine that and mix

1011
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,079
it all together and it's going to

1012
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:54,039
stabilize it by locking out the oxygen

1013
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,280
with all of that Sugar um and that's

1014
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:57,440
going to basically cause all of those

1015
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,200
microbes to go to like a Spore form

1016
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,039
so now we have a shelf stabilized

1017
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:04,679
version that we can keep indefinitely uh

1018
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:06,400
for for use as our store you know

1019
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:07,960
basically shelf stabilized pesticide

1020
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,440
that we've just made now when we're

1021
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,320
ready to brew that we're going to take a

1022
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,200
big scoop full uh if we're doing a

1023
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,400
smaller batch you can do a tabl spoon

1024
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:16,759
for you know a grow tent size if you're

1025
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,760
going to do a larger grow you know we

1026
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:22,240
were doing a uh you know four to six

1027
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:24,240
cups of it to do um about 8,000 ft of

1028
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,919
greenhouse it doesn't take that much you

1029
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,719
put that into a big paint strainer you

1030
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,240
put a AirStone or two in there and you

1031
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:33,358
brew it up in your bucket or in your

1032
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:36,479
trash can and uh uh brew that up for 24

1033
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:39,119
hours now um the IPO should smell

1034
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,679
freakishly like winter green uh when it

1035
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,240
finishes it has this amazing Pine winter

1036
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,919
green smell I can't tell you why I don't

1037
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,479
know what I think it's the fennels that

1038
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:52,079
are in it but um it it it comes out this

1039
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,719
incredible like winter green smell I'm

1040
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,200
I'm not sure if that's Universal it's

1041
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:57,199
been Universal with all the different

1042
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,879
places I've done it you might have a

1043
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,318
version with your local biology that

1044
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,599
doesn't make it happen but every time

1045
00:36:01,318 --> 00:36:05,880
I've done it that's what it smells like

1046
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,119
so now you have this all good brw mix

1047
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,640
that's basically the rewok up microbes

1048
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:12,519
that you went and collected that feed on

1049
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:14,159
kiten and now when you apply that both

1050
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:15,838
either directly to the root system

1051
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:17,639
through your fertigation just strain it

1052
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:19,199
and and apply it right to the roots uh

1053
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:21,838
you can also fol your spray it onto the

1054
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:24,239
plants um and it works to kill a huge

1055
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:26,759
wide range of insects but also uh

1056
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,959
instantly provides kenes directly to the

1057
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,079
PLS because those in that fungi broke

1058
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,599
down that kiten from those insects

1059
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,560
inside of it so you're also increasing

1060
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:36,720
the S response to the plant the plants

1061
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,078
now boosting its immune system and its

1062
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,039
own defenses and you're directly

1063
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:42,480
infecting the the insects that are on

1064
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,239
the plant so it's kind of like a double

1065
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,318
mechanism you're boosting the plant's

1066
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,000
ability to fight the insects uh and

1067
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:50,199
boosting it its nutrient uptake of

1068
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,679
calcium uh at the same time which also

1069
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:54,679
helps with insect resistance you're also

1070
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:57,279
um directly infecting the the the pest

1071
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:59,039
insects you know by applying spores

1072
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,319
directly to their body which then infect

1073
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:02,199
them and kill them and turns them into

1074
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:05,199
little white mummies which is really

1075
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:07,039
really cool but um it really is the best

1076
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:08,838
pesticide that I've seen or the best

1077
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:10,480
Innovation I've seen in in the organic

1078
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:12,759
World in a long time and I think that

1079
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,440
everybody should be sharing this recipe

1080
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,480
you know with anybody they can because

1081
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,358
it's a completely safe way to make a

1082
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,119
pesticide that really kicks the crap out

1083
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:22,318
of just a huge range of different

1084
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:23,720
insects um and it's completely safe you

1085
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:24,920
can drink the stuff and it's not it

1086
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:26,799
might give you a stomach ache but it's

1087
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,159
not going to kill you you know you're

1088
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,960
not going to have to go to the hospital

1089
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,519
there there's no kind of you know danger

1090
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,480
that's awesome I appreciate you sharing

1091
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:35,440
that recipe with us we have uh quite a

1092
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,920
few folks that take notes you know

1093
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,960
they've got their pen and Pad ready and

1094
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,358
they're they're taking notes on that and

1095
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,240
really with this this IMO recipe natural

1096
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:44,799
farming technique and there's so many

1097
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:46,719
different natural farming techniques out

1098
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,000
there but yeah again thanks for sharing

1099
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:51,078
that one I'm sure you've probably saved

1100
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,800
quite a few Gardens now in the future

1101
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:55,680
here because uh like you mentioned that

1102
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,800
sounds like it's very strong and very uh

1103
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,960
valuable for folks growing in different

1104
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,160
areas to kind of prevent pests or tackle

1105
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,000
pests I've even had people um use it on

1106
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:05,799
Broad mites and have success as well

1107
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,719
which surprised me because typically

1108
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,280
things with six legs do or eight legs do

1109
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:12,639
not work with with fungal bio controls

1110
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,440
so um you know again I haven't had that

1111
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:15,799
response but we have I've had reports of

1112
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,440
people two different people in Thailand

1113
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,760
using it to treat mites so um you know

1114
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,039
you never know what you're going to

1115
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,839
collect and and what it's going to work

1116
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:25,079
for but for the most part it is amazing

1117
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:28,318
for most of your larger insects across

1118
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:31,039
the board what about like storage tips

1119
00:38:28,318 --> 00:38:32,480
and shelf life on it so the oldest one

1120
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,440
I've had is about a year and a half old

1121
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,318
and it was still pretty viable um I

1122
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,039
haven't kept it longer than that just

1123
00:38:36,318 --> 00:38:40,279
because um you know it's kind of a newer

1124
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,960
Tech that's only been around really

1125
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,359
since two 2020 so most of the places

1126
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,800
we're at we haven't Che you know we've

1127
00:38:44,358 --> 00:38:48,598
either blown through the whole batch

1128
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,920
that we made or um you know some other

1129
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:51,559
thing where we just combined it with the

1130
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,680
next one you can combine multiple months

1131
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:55,799
too right so I like to do a collection

1132
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:57,639
every month and then I'll combine this

1133
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,318
month last month and the next month you

1134
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:00,838
know from the previous year so if I

1135
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:03,199
collect it in February I'm going to put

1136
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:05,400
January and March's collections in the

1137
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,639
following Year's application and you

1138
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,039
just combine those three when you make

1139
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:09,759
it so a scoop of this a scoop of this

1140
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:12,400
and a scoop of this and that's going to

1141
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,079
give you the best biodiversity in fact

1142
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,519
it's not that much different from you

1143
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,720
know who used to do this first was the

1144
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,599
Vikings they would take the the best

1145
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:21,519
soil from the end of the grow season and

1146
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,599
the you know right before Harvest put it

1147
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:25,639
into empty Rams horns and seal them with

1148
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,480
wax and then bury them below the frost

1149
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:29,159
line and then when the spring would come

1150
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,920
and the ground would thaw they would dig

1151
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:32,078
those up and spread them back out on the

1152
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,079
on the ground well they thought they

1153
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,440
were like putting the garden Spirits

1154
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,519
back onto the garden actually what they

1155
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,119
were doing is just inoculating it with

1156
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:41,079
microbes that were kept below the frost

1157
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,800
line uh and then now they're kind of

1158
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:45,119
just reinoculated their garden with the

1159
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,920
best microbes from the previous years so

1160
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,559
they had the same kind of idea it was

1161
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,079
just a little bit different methodology

1162
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,039
so a lot of the stuff is really much

1163
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,720
older than people realize or we've been

1164
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:55,920
doing similar practices we just kind of

1165
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:58,078
refin them you know significantly since

1166
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,119
uh since their Inception that's super

1167
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,560
interesting so getting into different

1168
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:04,160
areas I want to get into Garden setup

1169
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:07,119
and design there's a lot of challenges

1170
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:08,799
that can be faced going from setup area

1171
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,039
in different countries or even just

1172
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,000
different areas across the US what

1173
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:16,559
design challenges have you faced and

1174
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,079
kind of pivots that you've had to do

1175
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:21,078
growing in some areas versus others yeah

1176
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:24,519
so the biggest one hands down across the

1177
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:27,560
board was power um in Zimbabwe we had

1178
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:30,400
power from zesa from p.m. till about

1179
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:31,799
5:30 to 6:00 a.m. and that was it the

1180
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,960
rest of the time the power goes to the

1181
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,680
industrial zones and you don't get power

1182
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,119
so if you don't have power you know a

1183
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:39,719
generator or solar or you know some

1184
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:42,039
other way to power up whatever it is you

1185
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:44,799
need to power up that day um you are

1186
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:46,279
screwed so uh that was a huge part of it

1187
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,000
setting up all that infrastructure

1188
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,400
usually solar or or generators just to

1189
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,199
get get by in the beginning and then

1190
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,800
setting up solar pumps for long-term

1191
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:56,318
irrigation um is really just almost

1192
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,160
required once you get into most of the

1193
00:40:56,318 --> 00:40:59,759
remote areas um you know setting them

1194
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:01,679
all up to drip lines and then also on on

1195
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,240
a rotation schedule so like this field

1196
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:04,598
gets flooded on Mondays this field gets

1197
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:06,559
flooded on Tuesdays this field gets

1198
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:08,920
flooded on Wednesdays and then repeat

1199
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:11,078
again you know kind of thing so um that

1200
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,599
type of stuff is really you know uh

1201
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:14,318
indexing valves would be another one

1202
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:15,760
where we're able to do large volumes of

1203
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:17,639
stuff with one or two pieces of

1204
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,319
equipment because it's switching between

1205
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:21,440
four separate large zones or eight

1206
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:23,199
separate large zones um the one thing I

1207
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,838
would say with indexing valves is that

1208
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:26,879
make sure you're checking them daily or

1209
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:28,639
almost daily because if one of those

1210
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,559
fails you know you're losing thousands

1211
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:32,679
of plants if that that breaks and we had

1212
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:33,960
that happen at one facility in Jamaica

1213
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:35,480
um that I was working with University

1214
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,280
technology Kingston they had one that

1215
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,679
failed and it wiped out you know three

1216
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,960
of the four rows of plants that they had

1217
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:42,440
um because they weren't checking it

1218
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,920
regularly on the maintenance once it was

1219
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,079
set up the the guy just signed off that

1220
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,318
he checked it and wasn't actually

1221
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,560
checking it so that's another thing is U

1222
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:51,239
making sure people are actually doing

1223
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:54,838
and finding out like who in your local

1224
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:56,879
area is actually reliable um that you

1225
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:59,279
can count on you know is an another big

1226
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,160
thing but the biggest thing too is just

1227
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,960
drip lines drip lines are the best way

1228
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:05,358
to do large scale you know outdoor any

1229
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,559
kind because you're not going to get any

1230
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:09,039
of that evaporative water loss um and

1231
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:10,559
they're pretty easy to set up everywhere

1232
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:12,838
in the world you can find the drip line

1233
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:15,799
irrigation kits you know doesn't matter

1234
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:17,318
if you're as far away as Zimbabwe um or

1235
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,000
some of the other areas that maybe don't

1236
00:42:17,318 --> 00:42:21,838
have quite as much income uh in the

1237
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,639
world uh um you can find drip line kits

1238
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:26,239
at an industrial scale pretty cheaply

1239
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:28,239
anywhere so um the next thing would be

1240
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:30,519
properly sourcing fertilizers and and

1241
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:33,039
pesticides in most of the rest of the

1242
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:35,679
world is a lesson in Insanity um you

1243
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:37,400
really have to hunt and peack and often

1244
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:39,239
just import them from local countries

1245
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,559
nearby um you know in the case of

1246
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:42,838
Zimbabwe we had to import everything

1247
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,680
from Kenya or Zim or South Africa

1248
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:46,679
because they're the only two places that

1249
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:49,239
have bio controls that we can get either

1250
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:50,838
beneficial insects or you know all your

1251
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:53,558
standard you know things like Bavaria

1252
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:56,159
basana so on and so forth aren't really

1253
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:57,559
that much into the rest of the world yet

1254
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:00,159
yet with the exception of Southeast Asia

1255
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:02,119
Thailand was an exception where Thailand

1256
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:03,558
actually has a bunch of Bio controls

1257
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:06,720
that we don't even have here yet that I

1258
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:09,000
wish we I wish I had we have a 10in one

1259
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:09,799
which is like a or five in one uh that's

1260
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,519
B

1261
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:17,280
militaris and uh verab basana iseri

1262
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:19,759
medium and another one uh all combined

1263
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,720
into one in one application and that

1264
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,040
stuff kicks butt like like that's like

1265
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:25,919
your especially for thrips that like

1266
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:28,079
nukes the crap out of your thrips man

1267
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,480
they just wipes them out um and that was

1268
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,400
really a good Saving Grace for us for

1269
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:34,119
thrips but um that's another thing too

1270
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,000
in the US you can't do combined um bio

1271
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:37,760
controls right so they don't they can't

1272
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,119
legally sell a product that has bavia

1273
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,760
basana and metum in it as a combined

1274
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:43,720
application they have to all be

1275
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,520
individual active ingredients because of

1276
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:46,959
the pest control laws United States

1277
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:49,079
whereas in Thailand you can have two

1278
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,679
three four five bio controls and one

1279
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:53,359
separate powder you put in the water and

1280
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:54,838
mix it up and and run with it so um that

1281
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:56,318
would be another big thing that's that's

1282
00:43:54,838 --> 00:43:58,039
different is that sometimes you at least

1283
00:43:56,318 --> 00:43:59,719
in Southeast Asia it's a little easier

1284
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:01,759
for for the pesticide stuff to find what

1285
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:03,959
you want but you know in Zimbabwe you

1286
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,960
could buy paraquat at the hardware store

1287
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,838
and it's sitting right next to the

1288
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,679
ammonium nitrate and the barrel barrels

1289
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:12,318
of peroxide which you know is not a very

1290
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,598
good place to store all that stuff uh

1291
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:17,119
certainly not in the open where people

1292
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:19,240
are smoking cigarettes so uh it is a uh

1293
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:21,680
you know you see some stuff where you're

1294
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:23,239
like oh my brain hurts and I shouldn't

1295
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:26,159
be anywhere near this place right now

1296
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:27,558
but um you know that that's honestly the

1297
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:30,039
the biggest challenge is power and then

1298
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,599
sourcing stuff can be just if you aren't

1299
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:33,920
used to to to and the hardest part of

1300
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:35,880
sourcing is just finding whatever the

1301
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,240
local thing is like in Zimbabwe it's

1302
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:42,838
shopy and Lazada uh in Africa it's kind

1303
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:44,959
of whatever a website that you can find

1304
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:47,039
um so that a lot of it is just spending

1305
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,559
hours searching for all your list of

1306
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:50,318
equipment once you have your list of

1307
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:51,680
equipment as far as sourcing and and

1308
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:53,920
finding someone that can deliver it

1309
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:55,318
within a reasonable time too that could

1310
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,440
be another big problem depending on

1311
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:59,679
where you are I want to get deeper into

1312
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,559
genetic diversity just a little bit more

1313
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:05,078
here talking about modern techniques

1314
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:07,280
genetic engineering selective breeding

1315
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:09,640
what role does that play in shaping the

1316
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,720
genetic diversity of plants well as far

1317
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:13,159
as um selective breeding I mean I think

1318
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:14,399
that's one of the reasons why United

1319
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:17,000
States is kind of the king of the

1320
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,480
medical Plant World is because we you

1321
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,960
know fought the man one closet at a time

1322
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:24,800
you know we had at any one point you

1323
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,960
know 60 to 80,000 different breeding

1324
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,359
programs going in the us at anyone or

1325
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,679
more right to supply it's always was

1326
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:33,039
comical to me when you hear some of

1327
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:34,759
these big MSO and corporate guys going

1328
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:37,358
well there's not enough small producers

1329
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,720
around to to to supply the country who

1330
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:41,519
do you think supplied the country for

1331
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:43,679
the last 80 years right like that's a

1332
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,239
comical thing to say so I think but

1333
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:46,598
that's why you have you know the us as

1334
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:48,318
the leader on that genetically is

1335
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:50,559
because we did have so many different

1336
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:52,519
unique programs and every single breeder

1337
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:54,240
had a different thing in mind each one

1338
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:56,759
was chasing something different some had

1339
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,598
a medical problem some were chasing hype

1340
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:01,040
stuff some were chasing stuff that look

1341
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:03,440
good some just happened to get lucky and

1342
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:04,440
find a a gem in the rough and and ran

1343
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,480
with it you know there's plenty of

1344
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,039
stories with that you know Gorilla Glue

1345
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,719
was was an accident plant you know

1346
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:10,838
there's plenty of others out there that

1347
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:12,439
you know were just something

1348
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:14,719
accidentally got pollinated ended up

1349
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:17,000
producing a gem you know so there's even

1350
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:18,679
lots of stuff that was accidental um and

1351
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,400
people didn't so I think that's really

1352
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:22,078
the the biggest thing that's driving now

1353
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,838
nowadays you have a lot of this genetic

1354
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,880
marker assisted stuff and things like

1355
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:27,480
that um you know there's definitely some

1356
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:31,000
companies not that long ago that were

1357
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:33,480
screaming about uh uh uh what was it new

1358
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,599
outrageous new strains it's funny how

1359
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,358
the company that said that the CEO got

1360
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:40,079
fired and we've yet to see any of those

1361
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:42,440
outrageous new strains um I know that GW

1362
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,440
Pharma has a few genetically patented

1363
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,760
strains that they've never released to

1364
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,039
the public that they're internal that

1365
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,599
I've heard from eth talking to Ethan

1366
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,480
Russo but there's not a lot of people

1367
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,480
doing the GMO stuff yet at least not

1368
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,639
publicly and to be honest with you too a

1369
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,480
lot of the market does not want GMOs

1370
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:58,519
like

1371
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,440
80% of the canas market are people that

1372
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:02,679
already don't like GMOs right so it's

1373
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:05,280
kind of a why would you make something

1374
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:07,000
for a com for a market that doesn't want

1375
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,119
that thing right there's certainly some

1376
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,679
on the large scale commercial side I

1377
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,358
think you know things like triploids or

1378
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:14,078
or GMO stuff that's not going to be able

1379
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:15,838
to be pollinated it's cool when you just

1380
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,800
want to grow a field for biomass right

1381
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:19,480
and not have any males or have your

1382
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,119
neighbor neighbor be able to do his own

1383
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,199
breeding program and not screw up your

1384
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,440
stuff or have hemp growing you know seed

1385
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:26,759
hemp or Fiber hemp where they're not

1386
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,200
pulling males um and then you don't have

1387
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,680
to worry about it for your home grow I

1388
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:31,960
think that's or not home grow but like

1389
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:33,598
for your other nearby commercial grow I

1390
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,720
think that has viability for that type

1391
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,760
of stuff but personally I'm I'm not I'm

1392
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:39,159
not for GMOs or anything like that I

1393
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,000
also think that there's a potential too

1394
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:43,358
with autof flowers being kind of used in

1395
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,960
that way with um and I've talked about

1396
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:47,480
this a long time ago with Autos being

1397
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,838
used to kind of control the market you

1398
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,559
have triploids and Autos being like the

1399
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:54,199
vast majority of what's available to Hom

1400
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:55,480
Growers they have to buy each time once

1401
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:57,159
we have Federal legalization it means

1402
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,639
the feds can get their tax money each

1403
00:47:57,159 --> 00:48:01,159
time so I could see them doing some kind

1404
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:03,679
of law where and again this is being

1405
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:05,440
doomsday is but where the feds require

1406
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:08,000
those to be the only seeds sold so that

1407
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,880
they can control the market which you

1408
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,039
know that would uh piss a lot of people

1409
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,559
off including me um and it's something

1410
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:18,000
that is scummy enough I could see them

1411
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,599
trying to do hopefully I didn't give

1412
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,719
them any

1413
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:24,640
ideas so triploids generally are kind of

1414
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:26,719
against that huh no I mean a lot of

1415
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:28,239
great strains of triploids but I mean at

1416
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:30,199
the end of the day if you're selling

1417
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:32,838
seeds and people can't breed with

1418
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:35,039
them that's kind of uh you're kind of

1419
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:36,920
ending the line you know you're a lot of

1420
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:39,039
us that are in the community happen to

1421
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,519
to and a lot of breeders what are

1422
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:41,800
breeders supposed to work with you know

1423
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:43,199
if you're a new breeder just getting

1424
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,440
into the game you know you're not

1425
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:46,759
somebody that's been around for a long

1426
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,639
time you don't have 2,000 plus different

1427
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,240
Cult of Arts in your your selection like

1428
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,159
I do or a lot of other people do that

1429
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:53,598
have been doing this a long time you

1430
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:55,798
know how are you supposed to build a

1431
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,240
pool and to start working with to to to

1432
00:48:55,798 --> 00:48:59,079
to have the colors you need to paint

1433
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:00,558
your picture right like you got to have

1434
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:02,000
some different stuff so you can be oh I

1435
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,880
like the trait from this one I like the

1436
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,599
trait of this one I bet they'd be even

1437
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,240
better if I combined them this way right

1438
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,000
like that's what all of us have have

1439
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:13,000
experienced when we're doing breeding

1440
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,559
and by closing that door it takes away a

1441
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,599
lot of the fun of of actually just

1442
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,200
growing the plant so like again it's

1443
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:20,240
great for commercial production I think

1444
00:49:18,199 --> 00:49:23,480
it definitely has a place in the market

1445
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:25,598
but I wouldn't buy a 10 pack you know

1446
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:28,719
put it that way I got my hands on the

1447
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,440
Donuts triploid by Humbolt and I haven't

1448
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:32,879
planted them yet fig I'd plant them and

1449
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,880
try them out see see what happens there

1450
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,798
but yeah I mean from what I'm hearing it

1451
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,240
seems like there's more I don't know if

1452
00:49:36,798 --> 00:49:40,798
I should even say this but seems like

1453
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:42,798
more cons and Pros I feel like it's

1454
00:49:40,798 --> 00:49:44,679
never going to kind of overrun the whole

1455
00:49:42,798 --> 00:49:46,759
Market I feel like fem are always going

1456
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:48,000
to be the most popular right everyone

1457
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,760
the traditional home grow is just going

1458
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,798
to want fem and they're going to want to

1459
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,920
be able to create their own seeds and

1460
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:56,079
you can't really do that with tripid so

1461
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,838
I don't foresee tripid

1462
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:00,480
kind of overrunning everything and then

1463
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:02,119
like regs and fem kind of being outdated

1464
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,559
or obsolete but yeah it's kind of

1465
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:06,160
interesting that's kind of coming onto

1466
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:08,240
the scene here and seems becoming pretty

1467
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:10,519
popular out of nowhere my other question

1468
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:12,039
is is that what are the negative impacts

1469
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:14,199
of that tripa genetic like does it make

1470
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:16,400
it weaker to PM does it make it weaker

1471
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:18,000
to some environmental factor or insect

1472
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,200
that suddenly it you know because of

1473
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,599
that mutation it it's not able to

1474
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:23,838
express something that it needs to

1475
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,519
defend itself like that's that's another

1476
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:27,119
thing I always think about with this is

1477
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:29,199
you might make a great plant but if you

1478
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,358
know you breathe on it wrong and it gets

1479
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:33,159
petritis uh it's not that great of a

1480
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:36,000
plant right so so that's the other stuff

1481
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:37,719
I worry about is uh you know a lot of

1482
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,079
this poly hybrid stuff the moment I take

1483
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:42,039
it and put it outside just gets wrecked

1484
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,359
like like a lot of the super super poly

1485
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:46,358
hybrid stuff did not do well in Thailand

1486
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:47,920
it just got mold like like especially

1487
00:50:46,358 --> 00:50:49,798
when we're growing in the rice patties

1488
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,318
needs to be have some level of of mold

1489
00:50:49,798 --> 00:50:54,239
resistance espe you know or it's just

1490
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:55,679
going to not do well so um you know you

1491
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:57,879
can solve a lot of that with things like

1492
00:50:55,679 --> 00:51:00,759
IMO applications and boosting the plants

1493
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:02,760
but you can that only works so far

1494
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,839
before you know just nature is going to

1495
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,880
take its course too you know yeah that's

1496
00:51:04,838 --> 00:51:09,440
interesting I I guess it's not really

1497
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,720
surprising in a way because um yeah I

1498
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,280
mean this this whole episode has really

1499
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,879
been about growing plants in different

1500
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,880
areas and that's a good good example of

1501
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,599
a plant that doesn't grow well grows

1502
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,400
well in one area but doesn't grow well

1503
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,240
in another well think of it too like why

1504
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,000
do you have different genetic cultivars

1505
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:25,598
in different regions is because the

1506
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,599
genes are being triggered in the plant

1507
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,920
immune system to defend itself for those

1508
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,359
different things that increase those

1509
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,720
different secondary metabolites that we

1510
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:35,119
call flavonoids and tpin and other

1511
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:36,879
compounds in the plant so if those genes

1512
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,599
aren't being expressed over and over

1513
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,559
again in an indoor grow where they're

1514
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:43,000
kept sterilized especially if it's like

1515
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:45,079
a a rock W grow where they're all super

1516
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,679
sterilized how how are those genes going

1517
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:48,839
to get activated that's why you see like

1518
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:52,039
Hydro rockol stuff it's hard to get

1519
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:53,400
above three% tpin for most people unless

1520
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:55,599
you're really doing microbial

1521
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,240
inoculations if you hit take those same

1522
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,920
cultivar drop them in living soil or

1523
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:00,039
aquaponics and they have that Gene

1524
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,559
activation of all those different

1525
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:05,199
microbes you're going to start to hit

1526
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:06,880
you know four five 6% tpin uh on those

1527
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:08,399
out of those same exact cultivars

1528
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,798
because those genes are being turned on

1529
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,160
suddenly so um that's the number one

1530
00:52:10,798 --> 00:52:13,920
reason why you need to get microbial

1531
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:16,039
biodiversity in your root system is to

1532
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,240
turn those genes on and get that turpine

1533
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:19,719
expression on because that's going to

1534
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:21,519
boost not only the plant's immune system

1535
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:23,598
but also you know your yields and the

1536
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:25,559
and the potency of your your medicinal

1537
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:27,160
crops or even your lettuce and tomato

1538
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,839
you know you want to have good flavor in

1539
00:52:27,159 --> 00:52:30,879
your lettuce and tomatoes or cucumbers

1540
00:52:28,838 --> 00:52:32,358
or or eggplant you better have a good

1541
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,838
biological diversity it's why for

1542
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:36,400
instance a living soil lettuce out of

1543
00:52:34,838 --> 00:52:38,599
your backyard tastes better than the

1544
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,720
hydroc crap at the grocery store because

1545
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:41,960
all of those genes are being turned on

1546
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:43,759
inside the plant that make those

1547
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,119
flavonoids and without that you you

1548
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,079
don't have that gene expression that's

1549
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,920
why if you continually breed something

1550
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:50,798
in a sterile environment it's going to

1551
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,920
lose the ability to turn those genes on

1552
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:54,039
because why is it going to waste the

1553
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,200
energy to to to make those compounds

1554
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:58,159
anymore or to even try to turn those

1555
00:52:56,199 --> 00:53:00,118
genes on when it never has to deal with

1556
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:02,078
it and neither did its grandparents or

1557
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:04,599
you know it great-grandparents it has a

1558
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,240
long-term you know evolutionary lineage

1559
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:07,720
where it's not having to deal with that

1560
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:09,639
stuff so it kind of makes for weaker

1561
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:11,719
strains that are especially powdery

1562
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:13,719
mildew seems to be like the number one

1563
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:15,118
thing that these Ultra poly hybrids seem

1564
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:17,838
to be just really weak to when you put

1565
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,480
them Outdoors or you know certain insect

1566
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:21,400
stuff they just have no resistance to

1567
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,798
because again there there's no immune

1568
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,440
system to these plants and I think

1569
00:53:22,798 --> 00:53:26,280
people kind of forget that part of it

1570
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,720
that's a really good points there kind

1571
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,760
of reminds me of you hear a lot of

1572
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:32,159
people talking about genetic drift can

1573
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,839
you talk about what genetic drift is and

1574
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:37,318
how it's really impacted plants these

1575
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:39,400
days so genetic drift would be either

1576
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:41,358
from Super hybridizing something

1577
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:43,880
especially with itself or having just

1578
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:45,558
really old moms you know um remember

1579
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,559
that the plant's kind of constantly

1580
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:49,040
producing new tissue and it's again

1581
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:50,599
constantly turning those immune system

1582
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:52,798
genes off and on like we just talked

1583
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:54,200
about so uh if you have the mom that's

1584
00:53:52,798 --> 00:53:55,679
growing in one kind of condition and

1585
00:53:54,199 --> 00:53:57,439
then the flowering condition are much

1586
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:59,399
more different it's it's going to have a

1587
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,798
hard time with that and also too as

1588
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,838
plants age you they're going to have

1589
00:54:00,798 --> 00:54:05,039
some genetic mutation just from the fact

1590
00:54:02,838 --> 00:54:06,440
that the plants just living longer right

1591
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:09,159
um the other thing that people forget

1592
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:12,440
with is has some issues too when you

1593
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:15,318
grow it too long because it wants to um

1594
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,960
save its local genetic population so uh

1595
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:18,558
it's going to try to hermaphodite on you

1596
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,159
once it hits a certain age because

1597
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,119
that's built into the genes of the plant

1598
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,000
the same reason why like rootbound

1599
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:26,280
plants will trigger for the same thing

1600
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,679
because uh in the right you have a plant

1601
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,920
and it grows and grows and grows it

1602
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:30,519
doesn't get pollinated doesn't get

1603
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:33,159
pollinated doesn't get

1604
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:35,199
pollinated and now it gets a cold snap

1605
00:54:33,159 --> 00:54:36,399
or get some kind of like weather

1606
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:38,318
condition that's going to potentially

1607
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,798
kill the plant in the near future it's

1608
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:41,798
going to immediately try to produce that

1609
00:54:39,798 --> 00:54:44,358
female pollen so we can produce female

1610
00:54:41,798 --> 00:54:45,920
plants so that it can die and next year

1611
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:47,920
its daughters can come back and try to

1612
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,599
be pollinated by outside genetics to

1613
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,200
preserve that local population the

1614
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,760
plants evolved to do that when it

1615
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:55,078
evolved in the steps of of Mongolia and

1616
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,119
Tibet which is where it's from Orin

1617
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:58,640
originally um it it evolved that

1618
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,920
mechanism so that it didn't go extinct

1619
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:01,480
in its local region and and when you

1620
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,599
think about an evolutionary that makes a

1621
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:06,519
lot of sense for it to function that way

1622
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:08,200
right uh and and and evolutionarily

1623
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:10,079
that's a big Advantage but when you're

1624
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:12,279
trying to veg it and keep it from

1625
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,798
flipping that's a problem because you

1626
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,440
know there is a maximum life on the

1627
00:55:13,798 --> 00:55:17,519
plants usually about a year and a half

1628
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,679
two years where they're just going to

1629
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:22,318
start to to get real weird on you and

1630
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:24,279
some of those genes for that final end

1631
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:26,558
of life thing are starting to turn on

1632
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:28,200
because it's been alive too long or

1633
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:30,680
maybe you stressed it out too much or

1634
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:32,519
it's root bound after that or whatever

1635
00:55:30,679 --> 00:55:34,038
the the pressure point is but that

1636
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:35,679
something's going to eventually trigger

1637
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:37,720
those genes you know if you don't

1638
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,279
restart it and take new clones even if

1639
00:55:37,719 --> 00:55:41,199
you clone it that clone's not going to

1640
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,200
be exactly the same as that mother was

1641
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:45,118
it's going to be close but it's going to

1642
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:47,000
have a few mutations that are different

1643
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,640
or a few adaptations phenotypic

1644
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,798
adaptations that going to be slightly

1645
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:52,199
different from that mother and over time

1646
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:53,838
those start to build up and can cause

1647
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:56,239
issues the other thing I see a lot in

1648
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:58,000
really old ones and people often

1649
00:55:56,239 --> 00:56:00,358
attribute to genetic drift but usually

1650
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,679
it's not it's actually viral infection

1651
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:04,960
is is um you know particularly mosaic

1652
00:56:02,679 --> 00:56:08,358
virus and some of these others

1653
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:09,519
where if the plant is healthy it's not

1654
00:56:08,358 --> 00:56:12,119
going to have any kind of negative

1655
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:13,599
impact right um you know as long as it's

1656
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,240
getting all of it needs and the immune

1657
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:17,440
system is kept healthy but as the plant

1658
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:19,038
gets older and older it's less able to

1659
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,240
fight that so you get this gradual

1660
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:22,559
increase in viral load until it hits

1661
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:24,639
that critical point and now it's

1662
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:27,559
expressing in the leaves suddenly um you

1663
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:29,759
see sometimes too with hlvd hlvd in many

1664
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:31,480
cultivars will perfectly be fine if it's

1665
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,799
only detectable in the root system it's

1666
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,880
not going to affect the yields of the

1667
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:36,798
flower in fact Kevin mckernin has a

1668
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,559
wonderful white paper on this specific

1669
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:41,280
problem um whereas if the plant gets

1670
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:42,920
aged and that Viral low gets up and up

1671
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,599
and up now it's going to start to cause

1672
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,159
that that leaf mutation and the upper

1673
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:48,119
part plant mutation and things like that

1674
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:50,118
as well so that's that's how like for

1675
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:52,680
instance the Hop industry has has slowly

1676
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:54,680
gotten rid of uh hlvd was they didn't

1677
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:55,838
ever got rid of hlvd completely what

1678
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:57,358
they did was they got rid of all the

1679
00:56:55,838 --> 00:56:59,519
cultivars that actually have problems

1680
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:01,960
with it so it can remain latent in the

1681
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:04,358
plant but not have yield effects or

1682
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,960
negative yield impact so that you know

1683
00:57:04,358 --> 00:57:07,078
the industry is going to have to stop

1684
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:09,079
you know with this idea that they're

1685
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:11,440
ever going to get rid of it it it can be

1686
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:13,280
latent in cucumbers and tomatoes and

1687
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:17,039
corn right how are you going to get rid

1688
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:19,480
of that you can't and it's pollen spread

1689
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:21,160
so you could have a leaf Hopper go bite

1690
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,960
the guy's corn and then reinfect your

1691
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:26,279
plants right that you just spent all

1692
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:28,240
this lab work on it's a it's a

1693
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,240
it it's an impossible task you can't

1694
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:31,679
eliminate it right the hemp the Hops

1695
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:33,239
industry would have eliminated it a long

1696
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:34,598
time ago they spent 200 years on this

1697
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:37,038
problem and they still haven't figured

1698
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:38,559
it out right so we're not and they spend

1699
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:40,559
a lot of money as beer guys have as much

1700
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,160
money as the the the medicinal plant

1701
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,200
Growers do in terms of investment to

1702
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:46,159
protect their plants so you know again

1703
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:47,759
if if companies like uniu can't solve

1704
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:49,358
this you know we're not going to do

1705
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,319
anything magically different overnight

1706
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:53,078
that's going to suddenly do it so um

1707
00:57:51,318 --> 00:57:55,038
this is you know another big issue where

1708
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:56,680
especially you I can go into most Grow

1709
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:58,200
rooms and find at least one or two viral

1710
00:57:56,679 --> 00:58:00,558
infected plants where people don't even

1711
00:57:58,199 --> 00:58:02,598
realize it especially mosaic virus where

1712
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,960
there or or um I've seen a lot in the

1713
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:07,000
last couple years on outdoor plants beat

1714
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,400
um Leaf Crow virus or Bean Leaf Crow

1715
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,838
virus where it causes the really cork

1716
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,358
screwing and stuff like that um where

1717
00:58:10,838 --> 00:58:14,038
you know again it might not show in the

1718
00:58:12,358 --> 00:58:15,558
beginning but after the plants hit six

1719
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:17,680
or eight months suddenly it starts to

1720
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:19,039
rage out because that viral load has

1721
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:20,598
just hit that critical point where now

1722
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:23,200
it's going to express in the leaf tissue

1723
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:25,000
so that's another one where you know you

1724
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:26,798
don't see as much when you have big genc

1725
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,920
gene pool diversities you don't have as

1726
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:31,038
much problems um whereas with the small

1727
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,318
polyhybrid stuff you do yeah viruses

1728
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:35,000
vroid that's a whole another topic on it

1729
00:58:33,318 --> 00:58:37,440
so we could do a whole episode on that

1730
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,358
it's kind of scary you know I mean I I

1731
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,559
only imagine how many hom grows are

1732
00:58:40,358 --> 00:58:44,519
impacted without the actual grower even

1733
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,319
knowing that they're impacted by it they

1734
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:48,519
think it's a deficiency instead it's

1735
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:50,440
actually a virus or a vroid that's

1736
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:52,318
causing har to their plants and they're

1737
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,880
just treading on water basically trying

1738
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:56,558
to keep their head above water for that

1739
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,559
for that grow so yeah crazy stuff and

1740
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,000
I'm sure there's going to be a lot more

1741
00:58:57,559 --> 00:59:00,440
information coming out in the future in

1742
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,039
regards to that one I did have a

1743
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:04,119
followup question in regards to the

1744
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:06,280
mother plants now you touched upon how

1745
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:08,640
over time these plants are going to be

1746
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:10,440
more likely to Herm right so keeping

1747
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:12,279
mother plants around I think you

1748
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:14,079
mentioned one and a half to two years to

1749
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,839
keep the mother plant around is that the

1750
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:18,000
longest that you suggest keeping mother

1751
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:19,838
plants around yeah I mean ideally if you

1752
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,318
can swap them every 6 months to a year

1753
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:23,719
and restart them that's that's even

1754
00:59:21,318 --> 00:59:25,199
better um but yeah I mean the longest I

1755
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:27,798
would try to keep something about a year

1756
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:29,759
and a half to two years after that the

1757
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:31,079
likelihood of you not having problems is

1758
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,880
is pretty low you know you're going to

1759
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:37,798
have some kind of issue at that point um

1760
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,838
also size you know how if you're growing

1761
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:41,000
something that long even if you're

1762
00:59:38,838 --> 00:59:43,038
hacking the crap out of it every 10 days

1763
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,199
it's going to be a huge structure to it

1764
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:45,960
at that point and it just gets

1765
00:59:44,199 --> 00:59:48,439
unmanageable and it's a pain to to take

1766
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,159
new Cuts you get on a ladder and it just

1767
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:51,358
it's just not safe right especially when

1768
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:52,719
you get to bigger time and you're you're

1769
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:55,078
just working on that many hours you're

1770
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:56,719
going to have an accident so um um it's

1771
00:59:55,079 --> 00:59:58,000
much better to just restart them before

1772
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:59,439
they get too large from a safety

1773
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,639
standpoint but also from just a genetic

1774
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,358
drift standpoint you're going to have

1775
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,159
those issues with the the plants that

1776
01:00:02,358 --> 01:00:06,159
are that are too old and you're talking

1777
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:07,519
restart from seed right you're not

1778
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:09,440
saying grow the mother plant for two

1779
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:11,400
years take a clone from it and then that

1780
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,960
clone is your new mother plant you could

1781
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,079
in theory you can do that as long as you

1782
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,159
kept them healthy yeah again the the

1783
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:18,839
reasons why you end up having problems

1784
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:21,118
biggest ones is root B you know being

1785
01:00:18,838 --> 01:00:23,159
root bound um heat stress or or

1786
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:25,599
infection or insect damage you know any

1787
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:27,038
kind U light you know light leaks or or

1788
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:29,480
anything like that as long as you don't

1789
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:31,039
have those types of things um you know

1790
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:33,159
you can kind of get away with rebooting

1791
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:34,680
them for the most part again you can

1792
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:36,318
only do that once or twice though before

1793
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:38,399
you're going to still plant's going to

1794
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:39,798
have a maximum age before it's just

1795
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,480
again going to start having problems

1796
01:00:39,798 --> 01:00:43,719
they just get that those genetics the

1797
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:45,519
plant's not designed to live that long

1798
01:00:43,719 --> 01:00:47,639
so you're kind of doing a bunch of stuff

1799
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:49,719
where it's it's starts to make errors in

1800
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:51,480
its copies when it's making new tissue

1801
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:53,038
and things like that same way that we do

1802
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,960
you know that's why humans get cancer we

1803
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:56,960
start to have errors in our our system

1804
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,720
as we get older it's why older people

1805
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,440
have more than than younger people for

1806
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:02,798
instance so it's the same kind of

1807
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:04,440
problem got it so what other tips do you

1808
01:01:02,798 --> 01:01:06,318
have for growing genetics in different

1809
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:08,039
climates number one thing would just be

1810
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:09,838
you know narrow leaves and hot climates

1811
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:11,480
and and wider leaves and and colder

1812
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:13,960
climates would be kind of the the

1813
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:16,400
Baseline for that um try not to grow

1814
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:18,720
anything super poly hybrid in an outdoor

1815
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,680
environment period or if you do don't

1816
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:23,358
count your farm on it um I know the

1817
01:01:20,679 --> 01:01:25,480
first year that runs came out um I watch

1818
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:27,279
people plant you know an unseen amount

1819
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,880
of that in Oklahoma and I don't know a

1820
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,960
single person aside from us that

1821
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,640
actually harvested it um because all of

1822
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:36,159
it rotted you know if you're going to

1823
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:38,639
grow a really dense um flowered

1824
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:40,679
structured plant uh in uh somewhere

1825
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:42,279
where it's high humidity good luck you

1826
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:44,519
better put a heck of a you know

1827
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:47,000
probiotic uh regimen on that plant

1828
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:49,038
you're going to have major issues um

1829
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,679
really is a a huge Factor when you're

1830
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,319
choosing that you know grow something

1831
01:01:50,679 --> 01:01:54,078
that's more open and Airy with a less of

1832
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:55,920
a tight structure something that's

1833
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:58,480
larger and brancher in those more humid

1834
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:01,440
environments um making sure using IMO

1835
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:03,960
and IPO um for your stuff simply doing

1836
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,400
the lactobacillus IMO and IPO from

1837
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:07,119
curing natural farming on any kind of

1838
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,838
large scale outdoor is going to make

1839
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:10,039
your life so much easier the plants are

1840
01:02:08,838 --> 01:02:11,759
going to be much more naturally

1841
01:02:10,039 --> 01:02:13,960
resistant through a wide range of

1842
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,480
different Pest and pathogen issues um it

1843
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:17,559
really is going to be your your best way

1844
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:19,719
to kind of make things go as smooth as

1845
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:21,519
possible I can't imagine growing

1846
01:02:19,719 --> 01:02:22,639
anything at scale anymore without you

1847
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:25,798
know different natural farming

1848
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:28,000
methodologies just because of how much

1849
01:02:25,798 --> 01:02:30,798
of a good job it does at preventing you

1850
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,559
know petritis powdery mildew um and a

1851
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:34,599
lot of the other heavier insect problems

1852
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:36,359
septoria be another one where you know

1853
01:02:34,599 --> 01:02:38,760
I've seen people have huge fields of

1854
01:02:36,358 --> 01:02:40,960
septoria uh and wipe them out but I've

1855
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,920
also saved a lot of them too by treating

1856
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,798
malaab bacillus and then IMO

1857
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:46,358
inoculations um you don't have a

1858
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:48,480
store-bought product you can go to treat

1859
01:02:46,358 --> 01:02:50,239
septoria easily especially once that

1860
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,599
plant's heavily infected that's going to

1861
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:53,719
reverse that you can treat it with

1862
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:56,119
trichoderma or some of the other ones if

1863
01:02:53,719 --> 01:02:57,480
you catch it early on but traditionally

1864
01:02:56,119 --> 01:02:59,519
the agricultural industry will tell you

1865
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:01,679
to throw that soil away even right we

1866
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:03,278
can treat that in 3 weeks right so this

1867
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:04,798
is kind of stuff where the natural

1868
01:03:03,278 --> 01:03:06,519
solution actually works much better than

1869
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:08,519
the chemical one so once you start to

1870
01:03:06,519 --> 01:03:10,440
learn some of that stuff you your life

1871
01:03:08,519 --> 01:03:12,318
will get a lot easier um when it comes

1872
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,760
to the the especially the bigger scale

1873
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:15,599
stuff but even at the home scale for for

1874
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,839
tent Growers um it's just going to make

1875
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,160
sure you don't have to go buy those

1876
01:03:16,838 --> 01:03:20,880
expensive inputs uh at the shop you know

1877
01:03:19,159 --> 01:03:22,598
you can at least get half of your or

1878
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,680
2third of your pest control stuff just

1879
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:26,760
from your own backyard which is great

1880
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:28,598
there's some really really good tips man

1881
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,480
this whole talk has really opened up my

1882
01:03:28,599 --> 01:03:32,599
mind quite a bit and made me realize

1883
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:35,199
that the amount of knowledge I have

1884
01:03:32,599 --> 01:03:37,480
compared to what you can learn growing

1885
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:39,000
in different areas I mean it's just it's

1886
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:41,240
pretty much endless I think we're all

1887
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,798
going to be learning about this plant

1888
01:03:41,239 --> 01:03:45,000
for the rest of our lives right there's

1889
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:46,920
always more to learn there's things that

1890
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,000
we haven't uncovered yet and it's just

1891
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,278
it makes things so exciting and so fun

1892
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,838
thanks for coming on today really

1893

01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:04,960
questions that you have down in the

1931
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,880
the questions and if we get enough

1932
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:10,440
questions maybe we can get another

1933
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,079
episode with you to come on here and

1934
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,159
answer some of those questions because

1935
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:15,480
you have a lot of real in-depth

1936
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:17,719
knowledge not just on genetic diversity

1937
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:19,559
growing plants in different areas but I

1938
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:21,838
mean we had that episode on aquaponics

1939
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:23,640
which was just loaded with information

1940
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:25,480
you grow organically do a lot of natural

1941
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:27,798
farming so there's so many different

1942
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:29,318
areas we can go in definitely leave your

1943
