00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,859
featured in a future episode twitch.tv

9
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:21,118
Mr Grow It that'll get you there make

10
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,439
sure you follow and turn on

11
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,778
notifications so that way you'll be

12
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,118
notified when I go live next that being

13
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:30,660
said let's get into today's q a

14
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:32,700
I'm using a 284 dry Amendment for mid to

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,619
late flower in an organic grow is there

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,380
anything you would suggest adding silica

17
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:40,019
I always recommend people add in silica

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,120
Bryce holes is just a fantastic way to

19
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,399
get silica in your plant you know the

20
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,259
organic side of things many many

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,579
benefits with silica so if you're not

22
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:49,439
using so I think everybody should be

23
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,600
having silica in their grow if you're

24
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,238
not using like micro resolution fungi or

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,539
a microbial inoculant you can do that

26
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,859
worm castings are fantastic to use I

27
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,079
think that should be in every organic

28
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,238
Grill in my opinion yeah I would go with

29
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,760
those ones are there any good grow light

30
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:08,340
sales going on right now yes there is

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,100
the sponsor of this episode Mars Hydro

32
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,200
has a sale on the FC and fce series of

33
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,780
grow lights going on right now both are

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,640
bar style so an even light spread across

35
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,439
the footprint some have removable bars

36
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,700
so you can adjust them if you'd like and

37
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,919
all of them connect to their smart

38
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,259
growth system the fce series of grow

39
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,599
lights uses Bridge lock diodes it comes

40
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,900
in at a bit lower of a price point the

41
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:33,059
FC series of Lights uses Samsung 301b

42
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,460
and the ppf comes in a little bit higher

43
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,618
than the fce series both are good for

44
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,359
home growing and if you're on the

45
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:42,780

and you'll get a bit higher percentage

52
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,719
off what does your feeding process look

53
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,280
like I.E mixing nutrients in a specific

54
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,658
order I like this question it really

55
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,519
depends on if I'm using you know

56
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,439
synthetic bottled nutrients or if I'm

57
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,658
growing organic I'll break down both of

58
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,000
them start with the organic a little bit

59
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,819
easier in my opinion typically I like to

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,039
run organic Blends build a soil craft

61
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:15,839
blend it's a great organic fertilizer

62
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,780
I've been using it for many many years

63
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,459
also kiss Organics their nutrient pack

64
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,739
I'm using it for the first time this run

65
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,319
it's working freaking awesome I love it

66
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,878
and um both of them are very similar

67
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:29,878
feeding technique where you literally

68
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:32,878
just doing doing one cup per plant every

69
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:34,679
30 days so and I do a top dressing style

70
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,359
for that the past several girls I've

71
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,400
actually been doing a nutrient well I

72
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,739
spoke about that a little bit of my last

73
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,719
q a I believe also my main Channel video

74
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:44,640
I talked about that just dig down a

75
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,039
little bit of a hole in there put the

76
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,738
nutrients in that one spot bury it and

77
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,679
then that's an additional way instead of

78
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,719
just doing the spreading out the top

79
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,879
dressing All Along The Grill pot and

80
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,039
then some people will kind of mix it in

81
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,500
with that top layer other people will

82
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,598
put an additional layer of soil on top

83
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,580
of that top dressing and then kind of

84
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,259
water in I've done it all those ways

85
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,819
before just this past couple girls have

86
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:10,199
been doing that nutrient well now the

87
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:11,818
downside about the nutrient well

88
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:13,679
technique is a lot of people complain

89
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:15,839
that you're disturbing the root zone

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,140
right you're kind of digging down into

91
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,819
the soil making space for the Amendments

92
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:22,799
and then there's also the theory

93
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:25,139
downside people say oh well you're

94
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,939
concentrating nutrients in one part of

95
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,859
the grow pot how does that impact the

96
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,780
plant plan I've never had really an

97
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,879
issue where I saw any deficiencies

98
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,098
happening because the plant wasn't able

99
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,899
to get that nutrition so so nutrient

100
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:39,238
well is kind of the way and then yeah

101
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,680
organic feeding just one cup per plant

102
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,000
every 30 days for those ones in

103
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,879
particular I've done individual

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,699
amendments before organic amendments but

105
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,259
I'm not a soil scientist so I don't

106
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,839
really recommend people try to go in

107
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:53,579
there and fumble around themselves okay

108
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,200
those oyster shell flour put some of

109
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,420
this in alfalfa meal that's good for

110
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,859
this dump this in you know you might be

111
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,199
able to get away with doing that without

112
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,260
issues but in the long term you can have

113
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,419
can definitely have bad consequences on

114
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:08,039
the soil it can just be kind of an

115
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:09,780
imbalance of nutrition nutrients can

116
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,699
lock out of the nutrients so on and so

117
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,318
forth so I don't recommend that one so

118
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:15,539
that's organic when it comes to the

119
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:17,639
synthetic side of things I will always

120
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:20,639
follow the feeding chart as far as the

121
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,139
ratios do the different bottles but I

122
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,720
always just about always start with the

123
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,540
half dose sometimes even a quarter dose

124
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,699
of nutrition to begin so I'll mix out up

125
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,100
to usually put into a five gallon bucket

126
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,379
however much water I need then I'll put

127
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,600
the nutrients in the older I put them in

128
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:41,159
start with silica mix that in real well

129
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,439
then Cal Mag then the grow fertilizer or

130
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,020
Bloom fertilizer whatever stage I'm in

131
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,300
then after that I will pH adjust then

132
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:50,399
after that microbes so I'll mix that up

133
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,680
and then give it to my plants and

134
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,839
typically it'll be like every other week

135
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,400
typically is what it comes out to I

136
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,799
usually do the water feed water feed

137
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,719
technique so I water the grill pot then

138
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,699
when the medium dries out I have a dry

139
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,340
back in between waterings or feedings

140
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,978
after the water would be a feed dries

141
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:10,439
out water dries out feed so on and so

142
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:12,418
forth so very long-winded answer on that

143
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,339
one but uh there's plenty of details for

144
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:16,198
you how I do my feeding is there a

145
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:18,659
difference in the amount of ppfd for

146
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,340
autos and photos due to the extra time

147
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,380
under the light I think that's a good

148
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:23,939
question I think for many many years a

149
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:26,459
lot of us kind of neglected that fact

150
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:28,199
that Autos continue to stay on a higher

151
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,478
light cycle and it's just been kind of

152
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,478
generalized to this much ppfd and

153
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,879
seedling this much ppfd and veg this

154
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:39,120
plus ppfd and flowering and really kind

155
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:41,639
of neglected the photos versus Autos I

156
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,879
will um look at DLI is really what it

157
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,860
comes down to for that so yes if you're

158
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,259
if I'm have my plants in the flowering

159
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,919
stage for Autos I can still aim for that

160
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:55,199
600 to 900 ppfd but I might want to go

161
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,839
more towards the 600 ppfd for a lower

162
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,000
DLI of course CO2 is going to impact

163
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,918
that as well as far as uh you know how

164
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,139
much light the plant can intake but yeah

165
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,478
I would kind of Notch it down a little

166
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,759
bit particularly in flowering you know

167
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,099
you can definitely get away with six 700

168
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,319
800 ppfd particularly in the flowering

169
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,680
stage but you can still do the 200 400

170
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:18,120
ppfd for seedling 400 to 600 ppfd for

171
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,079
veg I think it's a good question because

172
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,120
I think a lot of people do it

173
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,279
differently let me know how you do it in

174
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,579
the comments section below what's the

175
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,138
best type of soil you use

176
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:29,758
easy question question for me I feel

177
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,038
like I talk about the soil just so much

178
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,479
as Foxwell motion forest soil it's just

179
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:36,719
kind of what I've been born and raised

180
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:39,180
using I started growing back in 2010 and

181
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,860
that's the soil that I started with and

182
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,600
my buddy actually who taught me how to

183
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,879
grow he was using that along with the

184
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,220
fox farm Trio so I've just kind of stuck

185
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:50,100
with that I have it at my local Nursery

186
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,840
it's a pretty good price and um it's got

187
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,000
enough nutrients to last me you know the

188
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,859
first 20 to 40 days of the plant's life

189
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,240
depending on what size container we're

190
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,100
talking about that's got to be my

191
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,319
favorite do you have you made compost

192
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,000
teas and if so how often did you apply

193
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,520
it to your plants yeah I've done compost

194
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,160
teas before I think I have some content

195
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,680
on compost teas but not enough content

196
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,539
but I've been using them I haven't used

197
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,180
them in several grows actually I used to

198
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:18,300
use them just in flowering really and

199
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,519
typically it was more so using them when

200
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,400
I was growing organic and maybe I did

201
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,379
that top dressing before or right at

202
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:27,239
flower and then after the first three

203
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:29,579
four weeks or so maybe I'm do I'm

204
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,280
hitting them with a t then and then

205
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:33,478
every couple weeks after that is usually

206
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:35,459
when I would hit it with the tea it's

207
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:38,459
just up until Harvest that's primarily

208
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:41,638
when I use teas and I feel like if I

209
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:43,560
don't need to use them why use them and

210
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,840
actually the past probably three four

211
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,220
Groves now I haven't had a need to use

212
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,439
them you know my plants have been

213
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,360
healthy throughout the entire Bloom

214
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,240
phase from using build a soil craft

215
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,220
blend and then other ones was Kiss

216
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,300
Organics nutrient-packed I spoke about a

217
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,580
little while ago I'm using that this

218
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,639
Crow plants look great you know I'm uh

219
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:04,918
mid flowering coming up towards the

220
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,300
final weeks of flowering for some plants

221
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,918
several different cultivars that I'm

222
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,079
growing this round so I'll be out really

223
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:13,019
compost teas as needed basis for me

224
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:16,019
flour Progressive light schedule or

225
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:18,538
higher in the beginning tapering off to

226
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:20,878
mimic nature I like this question I've

227
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:24,000
always just kind of been slowly

228
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,680
increasing the ppfd up until Harvest

229
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,660
that's always the way I've been doing it

230
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,819
actually I have done grills like years

231
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,099
ago six plus years ago where I would

232
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:34,860
lower the wattage this was with hid

233
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:37,080
lower it down for the final one to two

234
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,240
weeks in order to do exactly what you

235
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,158
had mentioned I've never done testing to

236
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,820
kind of see if there was a difference or

237
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:47,159
not so these past six plus years I've

238
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,200
just been doing uh just been doing full

239
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,819
last all the way up until Harvest it'd

240
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,620
be cool if somebody did do testing on

241
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,778
that though right that'd be really cool

242
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,539
to see if there was a difference growing

243
00:08:54,778 --> 00:09:00,360
from seeds or clones currently currently

244
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:02,219
I am growing from seed so I've got four

245
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,519
different cultivars going on right now

246
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:08,160
we've got runs by homegrown Co I've got

247
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,379
curb stomper that is why prism Labs see

248
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,299
what else do I have American Pie if I

249
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:14,580
grow more fire that one I think has hop

250
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:16,859
Lane thyroid I'm actually recording

251
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,240
footage about the plant showing the

252
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,519
plant why I think it has hot blade and

253
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,740
thyroid testing so I've actually taken

254
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,299
samples and sent off for testing waiting

255
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,159
to hear back results on that but the hot

256
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:28,979
blade and thyroid man it's got me so

257
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,539
interested because uh it's something

258
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,220
that I'm sure a lot of us have

259
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:34,620
experienced and not known it the

260
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,778
symptoms on it are like really like kind

261
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,159
of some of the symptoms are similar to

262
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:39,419
other deficiencies and so on and so

263
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,338
forth but like one of the ones that I'm

264
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:43,259
experiencing right now is the um the

265
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,540
overlapping leaves so for example like

266
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:47,700
you know five finger leaves if the lead

267
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:51,659
if the leaves kind of overlapping kind

268
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:54,120
of curl in like that that's a identifier

269
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:55,620
of a viroid hot plate and viroid I think

270
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,240
there's other ones it could be as well

271
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,799
so I wouldn't say that that's definitely

272
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,139
that but from my understanding that

273
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,639
indicates a problem right so I actually

274
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:04,259
had that for the first time I think ever

275
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,360
because I haven't noticed any plants

276
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:08,639
maybe it's not really a trait I've been

277
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,259
looking for but like that overlapping on

278
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,419
every single leave it's just it's weird

279
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:14,819
to see so anyways I sent it off for

280
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:16,379
testing and uh we'll see what it comes

281
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,778
back and see if it's positive or

282
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:20,338
negative but yeah just seeds as of right

283
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:22,679
now and everything's looking pretty good

284
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:25,019
oh and I'm also growing uh Hades Throne

285
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,458
by Zaza genetics so this is the four

286
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,980
that I got going on right now I actually

287
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,659
had to kill off a Hermie yeah that one

288
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,519
ended up flipping on me unfortunately it

289
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:35,278
looked freaking fantastic beautiful

290
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,019
plant in week three or I think it was

291
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:39,000
three a flower two or three a flower

292
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:41,879
flower development looking amazing and

293
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,220
all of a sudden ball sacks show up so no

294
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:45,899
bueno had to kill that one off I'm still

295
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,639
really sad about that to be honest with

296
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,879
you any record recommendations

297
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:53,039
techniques for older seeds yeah so the

298
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,620
technique that I read in Jorge

299
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:59,039
cervante's book so shout out to him he's

300
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,259
uh oh gee his Grower's Bible if you read

301
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,819
that you'll see that he has like an

302
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:05,458
interesting technique to where he's

303
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,620
taken the seeds and have like a piece of

304
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:09,119
sandpaper to kind of rough up the seed a

305
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,679
little bit or the side of like a

306
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,839
matchbox or whatever it's just a rough

307
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:15,778
area to kind of rough up the side of the

308
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,519
seed and then it claims that it helps a

309
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:19,860
germination rate

310
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,299
I do that at your own risk I think I

311
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,759
actually tried that before and it didn't

312
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,379
work for me but uh your question reminds

313
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,838
me of that but now just kind of dropping

314
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:29,519
them in water paper towel method those

315
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,779
are kind of the best ways I think of

316
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,639
checking to see whether or not your

317
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:35,759
seeds are good I think some people have

318
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:38,100
done special solutions that they dip

319
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,480
their seeds in or soak the seeds in I'm

320
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,700
not really familiar with some of those

321
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,860
those remedies that people have comment

322
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,440
below if you have any little home

323
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,480
remedies of uh getting seeds to

324
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,160
germinate kind of increasing those those

325
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,159
chances there would you ever try

326
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:55,439
carbonated water for a watering no

327
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,179
probably not to be honest with you I

328
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,160
just been using all real water and that

329
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:02,099
works for me so I don't really feel the

330
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:03,778
need to do it me personally I don't

331
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,278
think I'm ever going to try that one but

332
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:07,439
I think it's interesting for the folks

333
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,059
that do do things like that I'd love to

334
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,420
hear of your results if you do do that

335
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:14,278
opinions on a new vipa Spectra 1500 Pro

336
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:16,379
LED grow light I like them I have I'm

337
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:19,439
running two of them right now I had them

338
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:20,879
in my 2x4 grow tent for veg real even

339
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,160
light spread on them and then I switch

340
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,139
them over to my 4x4 I have them on half

341
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:27,480
my four by four then I have the new AC

342
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:29,458
Infinity Light the EVO 3 on the other

343
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,740
side of my 4x4 and

344
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:33,239
um I like running two lights for like a

345
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,700
two by four grow space because you have

346
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,459
that flexibility to kind of make light

347
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,379
distance kind of adjust you know some

348
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,578
plants growing bigger than others you

349
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:43,559
can have them on one side of the tent

350
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:44,879
and raise them raise up that light and

351
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,278
then keep the yellow light down now

352
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,600
oftentimes I will actually just uh you

353
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,278
know if I do have one light that kind of

354
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,959
goes across that old two by four I'll

355
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:53,820
just put it diagonal you know I know

356
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,500
some people are against doing that but

357
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,240
I've always been doing that and it's

358
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,039
been it's been help making that even

359
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,778
light spread and I have a power meter so

360
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:03,000
I gotta check to make sure that things

361
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:04,439
are kind of dialed into the ppft that I

362
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,778
want on the plants at the time but that

363
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,820
grow light is is great I don't have any

364
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:10,078
complaints on it at all actually I think

365
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,879
one thing that could be improved on that

366
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,979
is like the dimmer switch I don't like

367
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:17,700
the dimmer switches how they go from

368
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:20,100
like you know 25 50 75 it's just those

369
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:23,160
particular set points you can't adjust

370
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,959
it like from zero to a hundred to any

371
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,120
percentage so that's one thing I don't

372
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,819
like about is some grow lights have that

373
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,000
but it's fine it's it's no big deal I'm

374
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,680
uh yeah it's not small con I'd say back

375
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,778
in the day I always said estrogen would

376
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:39,138
make your plants female so people are

377
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:43,820
crushing up birth control into the sea

378
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:43,820
uh that made me laugh that's a good one
