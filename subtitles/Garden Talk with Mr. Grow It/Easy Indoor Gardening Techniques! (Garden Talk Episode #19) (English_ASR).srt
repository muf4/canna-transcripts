1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,640
coming up on garden talk when they get

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,719
switched to flower the day of flower

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,480
no matter when they got switched no

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,960
matter how long ago they got vegetative

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,719
nutrients i give them two tablespoons

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,160
per gallon of 484 period nematodes work

7
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:18,559
really well too

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,519
but you have to be uh diligent with them

9
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,038
as well

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,719
and keep dosing them because they still

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,118
come back and functions that's

12
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,198
their fungus knives come back so easily

13
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,719
i get very equal results from topping

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,519
the low search training

15
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:33,519
the difference is is that low stress is

16
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,839
less stressful and i've noticed that

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,120
even topping the plant can't stress it

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,280
out and it can be droopy

19
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,718
otherwise all these videos this dude

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,399
told me it was the best way like

21
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,800
everybody say that way is the best way

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,320
too

23
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,000
the only way you gonna know is just to

24
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,119
go ahead and do it and

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,520
figure out what's comfortable for

26
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,519

27
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,198

yourself kind of how you got into

118
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,799
gardening

119
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,479
getting into gardening was a long

120
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,799
journey for me i i started wanting to

121
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,318
grow

122
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,319
probably about eight years before i

123
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,079
actually started

124
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,560
and during that time i was living in a

125
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,000
house where the basement was all screwed

126
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,239
up i live in in detroit

127
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,519
in my old house a lot of detroit has had

128
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,480
problems with flooding basements and

129
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,480
stuff so

130
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,000
i tried to start then and i literally

131
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,479
built an entire growth

132
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,840
like out of out of two by fours and uh

133
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,598
black plastic and stuff

134
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,878
then the basement flooded destroyed all

135
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:02,878
of it had plants

136
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,079
it destroyed the plants and it was all

137
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,158
bad

138
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,439
and that was my first attempt and so

139
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:10,479
from that point on

140
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,878
i literally was so obsessed with growing

141
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,438
that i

142
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,120
researched it nonstop for like five

143
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,120
years straight after that

144
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,399
until i finally moved into the house i

145
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,399
was in

146
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,959
and i kind of forgot about it it's funny

147
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,719
because i once i moved i forgot

148
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,638
and it was one day i was over my boy

149
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,960
house and i still had these same sheets

150
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,160
the same packaging so ak-47 seeds the

151
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,879
first seeds i grew

152
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,880
on my first grow my first season i had

153
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,759
those seeds literally eight years i had

154
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,800
those seeds for eight

155
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,879
almost five years oh no i had them for

156
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,918
like six years i had them for five years

157
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,759
and then i stopped so when i moved

158
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,359
i forgot about it so i went over my boy

159
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,960
house who had been grown and uh and it

160
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,600
was about the time to start growing

161
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,399
right when

162
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,439
my first ak-47 season had started my

163
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,319
first

164
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,519
youtube season and uh he asked me he was

165
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,360
like uh how come you ain't

166
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,519
started trying to grow yet it's the time

167
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,199
it's like it's that season nah

168
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,120
and i was like you know what i do still

169
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,478
got those seeds and so i'm like i'm

170
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,519
gonna go ahead and i'm gonna go ahead

171
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,758
and drop him

172
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,198
and he had he was growing outside so i

173
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,479
tried to grow outside that time that

174
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,720
particular time

175
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,839
and if you uh watch my whole season you

176
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,919
can actually follow everything i'm

177
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,239
saying because i started it outside

178
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,000
and uh and then i got like a super crazy

179
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,639
rain and it just like i came home one

180
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,478
day and

181
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,840
all the plants was tilted over and it

182
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,199
was all laying down and

183
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,359
the dirt was falling out the cups and

184
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,720
stuff so i moved it all inside

185
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,879
and i just started going from there and

186
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,479
then one day my the he

187
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,918
the same guy told me he was like how

188
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,439
come you don't record

189
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,038
everything and then make videos for

190
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,439
youtube for it because i've been doing

191
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,120
it

192
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,038
and i'm like i've been recording it for

193
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,840
myself and i'm like you know what i

194
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:45,759
should do that

195
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,198
literally in my first video i took every

196
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,720
clip i recorded

197
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,240
not making it for youtube but i just

198
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,000
took the clips i recorded for myself and

199
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,600
made my first video out of it

200
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,120
and i just been doing it ever since then

201
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,840
so it's been a pretty cool journey since

202
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,360
then

203
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,599
that's awesome that's really cool so you

204
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,199
just had that one outdoor season or

205
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,560
one outdoor period and then you brought

206
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,680
indoors and you've been indoor is

207
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,079
everything yes sir

208
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,360
yeah it was like a week outside and then

209
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,478
i didn't make it i'm trying to do

210
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,199
outdoor grow right now

211
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:13,038
but yeah i was like a week outside it

212
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,560
scared me too much and i just brought it

213
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,439
inside and

214
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,639
got a tent started from there gotcha are

215
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,839
you mostly growing

216
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,639
autoflowers or photo periods or what

217
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,839
um at first i was growing both it took

218
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,720
me a while to figure out what i really

219
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,279
liked the most

220
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,840
and at this point i could say for sure

221
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,719
that i like i prefer photo periods

222
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,638
but i do grow autoflowers and i had a

223
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,120
lot of recommendations for autoflowers

224
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,720
that people

225
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,639
like and i've had i've grown a lot of

226
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,600
great autoflowers too

227
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,519
so i do i do like them both but for me

228
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,560
personally in the amount of space that i

229
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,240
have

230
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,478
i prefer doing photo periods so i've

231
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,038
been sticking to that mostly

232
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,079
um but if i had more more space i would

233
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,000
grow everything i like

234
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,439
the photo periods i want to get into

235
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,038
breeding and stuff too and

236
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,959
i want to start making some feminized

237
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,680
seeds so yeah

238
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,598
nice nice yeah i know that um you know

239
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,759
i've seen some of your your indoor grows

240
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,038
on youtube and one thing i know what you

241
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,639
really like to do is you like to keep

242
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,560
things simple you like to make things

243
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,240
easy uh you have kind of a more

244
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,598
laid-back hands-off approach that's

245
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,800
really what i want to get into

246
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,759
here in this podcast is ways to make

247
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,919
things easy

248
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,520
simple techniques that you do so on and

249
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:24,399
so forth so we're going to get into the

250
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,519
questions that

251
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:29,918
i sent you several weeks ago

252
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,079
we first tried to plan this out and

253
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,680
we'll go through your gross style and

254
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,598
we'll talk about some of the things you

255
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,439
do so for indoors

256
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:41,680
what size growth space are you in oh so

257
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,598
i have three tents i work in a two four

258
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,800
by fours and a three by three

259
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,878
um i like the i like the 4x4 the most

260
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,879
um for my photo period plants it's

261
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,199
perfect for what i like to do

262
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,919
i like to keep four or seven gallon pots

263
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,319
flowering

264
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,159
like towards the end one of my 10's is

265
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,598
just the veg 10 which is well i don't

266
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,280
know if you can see this is the

267
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,598
flower temple right next to it is the

268
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,198
vegetation and so i various plants out

269
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,560
in there and then flipping the flower

270
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,000
right away

271
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,598
and i've been doing that with my other

272
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,519
tent too but my other tent was mainly

273
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,199
the autoflower tent

274
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,598
mostly but um yep 4x4

275
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,439
mainly is my favorite space so far but

276
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,719
again i'm in a very tight space as well

277
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,839
so

278
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,520
i like to get in bigger bigger spaces i

279
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,439
hear you i'm similar to you i've got

280
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,120
a small area to work with myself i've

281
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,560
just got right now i just got one four

282
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,399
by four and one two by four

283
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,599
so i'm actually running smaller than

284
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,360
what you got there

285
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,759
um no what are you using for for

286
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,479
lighting for the three tenths

287
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,000
oh so i got all mars harder lighting i

288
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,519
got a um

289
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,759
right now i got in the three by three i

290
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,000
have an fc 4800

291
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,958
uh i don't run it at full power i rented

292
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,839
about i ran at about 400 watts

293
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,278
during the peak of flower um it's pretty

294
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,560
it's pretty uh

295
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:00,240
it's built for a 4x4 but i like to go by

296
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,399
i got this i got this from mr canucks

297
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,839
too that you that you go off for 35

298
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,080
watts per uh

299
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,080
per square foot and i've had great

300
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,519
success with it since i started so i've

301
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,639
been sticking with that ever since i

302
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,519
started

303
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:16,480
so i go strictly off of that and in the

304
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,799
other 4x4 i have a ts3000

305
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,519
uh man i like to have like around 600

306
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,399
watts per

307
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,278
uh 600 watts uh true watch from the wall

308
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,919
in there

309
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,278
uh and then i also have a uh the other

310
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,838
4x4 i have two sp

311
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,838
3000s currently right now and they're

312
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,600
all running at 300 watts

313
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,519
so 600 watts so i like to keep them

314
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,959
around the same thing at 35 watts per

315
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,799
square foot

316
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,319
the science behind it i'm not completely

317
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,958
sure about but i've had

318
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,959
wonderful success with it and i've done

319
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,199
less than that and i've had i've had

320
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,399
less success so i'm thinking that's the

321
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,240
sweet spot for

322
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,519
what we're trying to go for here i've

323
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,919
had my hands on the

324
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,600
sp 3000 two of them in a fallback before

325
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,559
i did a part test on it and it looks

326
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,680
like it rocks

327
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,359
so um yeah that's cool to see

328
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,359
you running that because when i was

329
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,839
doing the part test i'm like man

330
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,519
who's running two of those it's gonna be

331
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,120
working real good for them so

332
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,799
that's cool to see i had my hands on the

333
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,399
ts 3002

334
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,958
i thought that was pretty good and then

335
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,159
the fc 4800 that's one of the newer ones

336
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,679
right that they released

337
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:19,679
is that the bar style one how do you

338
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,399
like that the fc 4800

339
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,799
is awesome actually with the with the

340
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,000
bar

341
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,679
the bar style lights that it has i had

342
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,200
really good light penetration and the

343
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,759
first time i used it

344
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,720
was with some very small clones that

345
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:36,159
turned out

346
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,480
really really great um the buzz

347
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,719
the i grew og kush a lot of times

348
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,480
already and the one time i grew it

349
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,160
was starting with very small clone

350
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,800
underneath the 4800

351
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,919
i had a really nice size buzz really

352
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,879
dense buzz and

353
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,639
it was really good so i'm thinking i'm i

354
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,679
actually really like that that i like

355
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,120
like that like um for that first run

356
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,120
so i'm going to be using it i'm going to

357
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,519
stick with it for a while i have the uh

358
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,360
the detachable ones too uh so i'm

359
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,278
actually gonna be putting the 6500 in

360
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,039
the other 4x4

361
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,639
i'm liking the i'm liking the bar style

362
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,039
lights i'm thinking that that allows a

363
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,360
greater penetration so i'm going to

364
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,519
experiment more with it to see how the

365
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,800
results we get from

366
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,959
yeah it definitely helps with like the

367
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,559
light spread across the footprint right

368
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,000
having that even light spread that's one

369
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,399
thing i personally like about those

370
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,519
bar style lights i like with the bar

371
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,480
style light six when you can dim them um

372
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,000
you know when you're not running co2 you

373
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,360
don't need to have these things at full

374
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,078
power right unless you're frying with

375
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,519
plants

376
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:39,838
are you running co2 or now no i don't i

377
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,440
actually have

378
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,320
i'm sorry about that i actually have a

379
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,680
million kids so

380
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,079
that's one of my things about trying to

381
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,159
keep everything simple because they

382
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,759
keep me really busy and my i got a wife

383
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,360
and like they keep me really busy you

384
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:54,240
know there's a lot of stuff that goes on

385
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,399
so

386
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,399
like i live in a world where i want to

387
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,958
grow but i'm going to make mistakes

388
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,559
and so like i try to like i try to keep

389
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,638
things as simple as possible so that i

390
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,719
can maintain and get a

391
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,759
get good results while still being

392
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,320
distracted by

393
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,000
everything else in the world and because

394
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,519
of that i don't use co2 because i have

395
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,519
so many people in the house

396
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,200
that there's plenty of carbon dioxide

397
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,240
flowing around here so

398
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,560
the kid is always up here this is

399
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,079
and then i got millions of nephews and i

400
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,000
got cats and

401
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,159
so i got plenty of carbon dioxide in the

402
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,240
house i actually don't supplement it

403
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,679
um i tried it once and i didn't notice

404
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,360
anything different

405
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,439
and i'm thinking now it's because i'm

406
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,720
already i already got a decent amount of

407
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,800
co2

408
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,320
in the house already yeah that's a good

409
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,679
point uh if you have people living in

410
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,200
the same house we're growing in i mean

411
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,838
that is gonna be enough co2 for the

412
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,519
plant

413
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,680
uh but i assume you do some sort of like

414
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,759
um like air exchange

415
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,519
in the tent do you have like inline fans

416
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,000
that you're kind of exhausting out of

417
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,399
there how

418
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,600
is that set up yeah that's all i have is

419
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,879
just the exhaust fan

420
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,399
uh i run an exhaust fan in each tent um

421
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,320
i haven't been uh

422
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,519
i don't use the carbon filters i don't

423
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,120
have to worry about the smell as much

424
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,799
actually i just realized that i probably

425
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,879
should because the

426
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,719
dry nutrients smell really bad when you

427
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,919
water so i just realized

428
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,399
recently that i should use carbon

429
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,078
filters but i only got three uh exhaust

430
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,759
fan each one i don't have any intake

431
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,239
fans i allow

432
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:24,399
my vents to stay open and i leave like a

433
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,879
vent or two on the side the bigger tents

434
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,559
i leave

435
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,078
two vents open and then my three by

436
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,039
three i just leave one open

437
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,958
and i take care of the intake of the air

438
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:33,919
and the exhaust says the air has to be

439
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,518
replaced as the

440
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,360
air is being exhausted out of the tent

441
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,078
so it works pretty good

442
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,680
and i exhausted air right into my room

443
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,919
i've been doing that ever since i know a

444
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,759
lot of people like to

445
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,958
like to exhaust it out of the room

446
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,039
completely

447
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,719
uh i wasn't able to do that in the

448
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,000
situation that i'm in

449
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,480
uh because my room is in the attic and

450
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,759
it's a weird room um so i just exhaust

451
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,839
everything right into the room and i

452
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,958
haven't had no problems with it so

453
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,440
that's all i do one exhaust fan then one

454
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,078
uh

455
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,199
air to circulate the air inside the tent

456
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,239
and that's it

457
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:11,439
must smell amazing in there oh man

458
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,560
when the plants are flowering this

459
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,680
is wonderful i love to leave the house

460
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:19,439
and then come home

461
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:21,679
and they'd be like oh my god oh i smell

462
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,760
the water

463
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,120
they get used to it right here all day

464
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,120
right right

465
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,360
yeah i actually don't i haven't been

466
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,198
running carbon filters either

467
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,879
and that's a good thing to bring up

468
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,399
right is that's an optional piece of

469
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:35,120
equipment if you don't need to smell you

470
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,799
don't need that

471
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,839
piece of equipment so yeah another way

472
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,879
to kind of keep it simple if you don't

473
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,760
need that smell don't even buy the

474
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,320
equipment exactly

475
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,399
there you know exactly but yeah i think

476
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,399
my neighbor is probably

477
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,839
can smell it like late flowering you

478
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,799
know how it is like even when you're

479
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,040
like drying

480
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,679
like it they can even smell it you know

481
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:55,278
it's dry and be something different too

482
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,239
that's when they transform and they get

483
00:14:55,278 --> 00:15:00,480
a lot more a lot a lot a little

484
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,560
danger i've had so many like fedex

485
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,240
drivers and ups drivers like

486
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,239
just like smells good in there

487
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,560
that's funny let's uh let's continue to

488
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,519
talk about environment a little bit

489
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,799
temperature

490
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,799
what do you usually aim for when it

491
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:17,599
comes to attempts

492
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,879
um so this is a this is another thing

493
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,759
when it comes to keeping everything

494
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,439
simple

495
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:25,120
uh ideally ideally like when i get into

496
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,240
a facility i would like to keep

497
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,399
everything

498
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,278
i would like to have different temps and

499
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,278
ranges for

500
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:35,838
vegetative and flower plants

501
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,519
um but being all in one room and not

502
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,120
being able to do that

503
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,039
and having to have everything up here to

504
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,720
keep it safe for my family

505
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,240
everything pretty much runs at the same

506
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,440
temperature and the same humidity all

507
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,278
the time so

508
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,959
the only thing i can control and i can

509
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:52,000
keep a difference in is the

510
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:55,599
drying tent which i like to keep is 65

511
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,440
rh but inside the room i'm pretty much

512
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,079
at the mercy of whatever the season is

513
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,639
so

514
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,719
if it's winter time outside then the

515
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,879
humidity in here is nothing

516
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,000
like there is no humidity in the air in

517
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,360
here because it gets

518
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,320
extremely dry in the winter time and uh

519
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,839
and there's no way i can it's i've tried

520
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,278
i've tried

521
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,600
um i've tried raising the humidity in my

522
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,600
veg tents and stuff and

523
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,440
it just it's just impossible in this

524
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,159
room in this room this room is

525
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,959
horribly insulated and it's just it's

526
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,799
just a

527
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:32,078
pain and then vice versa in the

528
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,359
summertime the humidity is super high so

529
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:34,879
it's kind of different in the summer

530
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,039
because the air conditioner helps lower

531
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:40,399
the humidity so i keep the humidity

532
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,399
around 40 50 ish

533
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,480
and that's about as low as i can get it

534
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,959
but it doesn't bother the plants and

535
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,399
flower

536
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:51,919
and i've had really any problem um

537
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,320
at first at first my best

538
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,639
plans that were used because i did use

539
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,800
the runner i had a humidifier that i ran

540
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,639
into veg 10 for a while

541
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,639
but i was literally refilling it every

542
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,078
few hours which drove me crazy and i

543
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,439
just was like you know what

544
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,438
i'm like y'all just not gonna have no

545
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,360
humidity because i can't do this

546
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,880
i can't keep up with it and they ended

547
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,479
up they had during that growth of that

548
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,839
particular growth they adjusted to it

549
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,640
which i learned and the plants will

550
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:16,558
adjust

551
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,079
and they'll go for they'll do fine even

552
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:19,519
my clones

553
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,798
i don't have a dome over my clones

554
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,160
either and they don't have a problem

555
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,639
with that either so

556
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,240
they're pretty uh relentless relentless

557
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,840
guys there so they

558
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,120
they they adjust and i pre ended oh i

559
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,038
didn't answer the temperature

560
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,199
the temperature i do have great control

561
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:37,440
over

562
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,720
i always keep the temperature around 75

563
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,160
in the room period

564
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,000
with the air conditioning during the

565
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,360
summer and the winter i'm

566
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,038
able to keep it around 75 70 i had a few

567
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,759
times that has gotten super

568
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,200
super high being in the attic um it is a

569
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,440
fight to keep it there that's why i

570
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,038
asked the lowest i could ever get it

571
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,038
but yeah humidity though either

572
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,640
i can't control humidity at all you

573
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,640
bring up a great point is

574
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,720
you don't really have to have the

575
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,000
optimal humidity right that

576
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,759
that is widely said online is

577
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,079
you need to be in this range for veg

578
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,480
this range for flowers so on and so

579
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:14,798
forth

580
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,079
you can get away with lower than that

581
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:16,400
you can get a little higher than that

582
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,759
right

583
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,519
it's not going to be growth but the

584
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,599
plant will still grow the planter is

585
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,879
resilient like you said so

586
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,719
if you are trying to keep it simple if

587
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,919
you're on a budget or whatever you can

588
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,519
probably get away with not

589
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,080
having some of this equipment and not

590
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:32,319
regulating humidity and stuff like that

591
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,678
so now people could probably argue about

592
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,839
the overall final

593
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,440
quality of the product i mean i think

594
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,359
that's a fair use on that but

595
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,798
you can still the plant will still grow

596
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,558
still usable

597
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:44,079
it's not going to be detrimental to you

598
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,558
grow until you have nothing

599
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,839
to harvest you know man i think with

600
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,678
people i think

601
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:51,038
people get hung up on a lot and which is

602
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,559
something for me

603
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,798
starting off is getting into learning

604
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:58,879
about growing

605
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,918
everybody makes it like an extremely big

606
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,480
deal like

607
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,400
like everything has to be perfect um

608
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,120
this has to be there this has to be that

609
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,880
way

610
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,879
if you're not doing this then your stuff

611
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,640
is trash and a lot of people get

612
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,160
discouraged by that

613
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,038
but we we we growing we're running for

614
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,798
ourselves

615
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,279
and like that's why i tell myself and

616
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,038
like like when i when i was done

617
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,720
i was happy with like even though i

618
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,558
wasn't the greatest like my first time

619
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,160
when i got done with my first growth

620
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:27,678
like it wasn't the greatest i ever had

621
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,400
but i was happy

622
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,759
and it was satisfying to me and that's

623
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,519
why i did realize like man i

624
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,679
just like it may not be the best of the

625
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,000
best but i'm not trying to like

626
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,798
sell this stuff like i'm just trying to

627
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,240
appease my

628
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:44,079
own my own pastimes and and

629
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,640
and i think that i think that people

630
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:49,678
need to think about what's good for them

631
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,759
and and and just do it and see

632
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,600
how you like it like don't get hung up

633
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:54,960
on it being the best ever or you know

634
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:55,279
it's just somebody tell you like this

635
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,360
but

636
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,879
that's not the biggest or it doesn't

637
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,240
smell like just do it and see how you

638
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,200
like it for yourself man you're gonna be

639
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,279
satisfied

640
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,720
for yourself and you're gonna you're

641
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,119
gonna go you're gonna

642
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,480
do as much or work as hard as you need

643
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,678
to work so that you can get what you

644
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,038
want

645
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,159
well i think that's really important

646
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:13,200
that people remember that they're doing

647
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,919
it for themselves

648
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,720
absolutely for sure i mean you even had

649
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,120
a

650
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,200
grow i saw on your youtube channel where

651
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:24,399
10th went up to 106.

652
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,600
and uh that would you still got a final

653
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,880
product out of it right you want to talk

654
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,759
a little bit about that

655
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,200
i did that that was amazing too and i

656
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:33,038
was that was another thing that showed

657
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,558
me like

658
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:36,158
just listening for everybody else when

659
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:37,200
things like that happen i started

660
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,679
panicking

661
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,279
i panicked like i came home i opened the

662
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,880
door let me tell you how hot it was i

663
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:46,399
opened the door to my room

664
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,720
and it was like a sauna like and like i

665
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,759
italy started sweating i'm like

666
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,798
what the heck like and not only that

667
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:56,158
the aroma from the room was so strong it

668
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,079
was like it cooked them like

669
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,559
it was like they got cooked in the heat

670
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,519
and i literally panicked like i lost my

671
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,918
mind and

672
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,558
i went through here opened the window

673
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,440
fan and

674
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,879
i opened the tents all the way all took

675
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,200
them all the bars and

676
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,919
left them open all night and like the

677
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,480
plants was all

678
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,240
droopy and they were hurt from it but

679
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,720
and i panicked and i i really thought

680
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,319
that that

681
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,000
that harvest was gonna be for nothing

682
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,359
man it wasn't

683
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,359
it was wonderful like you would have

684
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,038
never knew you never knew that that

685
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,319
happened to it

686
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,000
that's awesome that's funny good

687
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,678
recovery i'm glad you were able to to

688
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,480
get stuff out of that that's it yeah

689
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,440
that's good

690
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,120
that's one of my scariest scariest uh

691
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,200
time since i've been doing it

692
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,558
let's switch it up let's talk about what

693
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,279
medium you grow in so

694
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:44,319
are you in soil coco i know you don't do

695
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,918
like dwc or anything like that i use

696
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,879
roots organic soil

697
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,799
which is which is mostly cocoa and peat

698
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,960
moss so it's not actually soil

699
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,240
peat moss parsley soil but it's mostly

700
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,720
cocoa and pima

701
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,839
and perlite it's a lot of perlite too

702
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,720
but it's been

703
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:02,959
i use it i use it once and i had great

704
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,679
results with it and the plants

705
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,558
all love it and so i've been using it

706
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,640
ever since

707
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,759
i don't really know much about dirt

708
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,080
either so

709
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:15,519
i recently went to the store was was uh

710
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,439
there was a lot of guys walking down

711
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:19,918
with bells of um

712
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,038
pro mix and i was asking the guy about

713
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,559
the pro mix and

714
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,480
he confused the crap out of me like

715
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,000
that'd be the kid like if you complicate

716
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,679
stuff so much i was like

717
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,759
he said like you got to do this and then

718
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,240
mix this down and then put some of this

719
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,279
in and i'm like oh my god oh like never

720
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,519
mind

721
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,798
like i just i just gotta get through

722
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,759
this again because

723
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:39,759
i'm not about to do that

724
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,759
is basically making his own amendments

725
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:44,798
which i know a lot of people do but it

726
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,200
was just like

727
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:48,960
i just bought uh i'll just get the rules

728
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,038
organized i didn't even know

729
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,440
i thought y'all were just growing in the

730
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:55,279
pro mix

731
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,960
are you uh does the roots organic i've

732
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,879
heard of it i'm not i haven't grown it

733
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,600
before does it have nutrients already in

734
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,960
it

735
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,959
yes yeah it's real uh real heavy and

736
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,319
vegetative nutrients

737
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,798
and it's not it's not too bad too that

738
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,839
it'll burn the plants because when

739
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:13,679
sometimes when i

740
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,399
go right in the flour and i use that

741
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:19,120
i'll mix flour nutrients directly in it

742
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,759
and it has no issues with that either so

743
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:21,918
this is

744
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,279
it's like the perfect mix and i've had i

745
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,919
have used uh

746
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,960
fox farm soil the very very first time i

747
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,360
tried to grow

748
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,159
and it actually was burning my plants my

749
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:34,639
uh all of the plants all my uh

750
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,760
all my seedlings they all they all came

751
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,759
all kind of burnt

752
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,359
they were fine they were still growing

753
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,759
but they came out looking kind of weird

754
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:41,759
and

755
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,759
i didn't know why then but now i'm

756
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:44,319
thinking it was because the soil was too

757
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,000
hot

758
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:49,038
oh interesting yeah interesting yeah i

759
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,359
primarily use the fox farm soil i think

760
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,119
out of the you know sometimes you know

761
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,599
you leave the soil up

762
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,439
yeah yeah yeah that could be more

763
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:59,199
breakdown and stuff like that but uh

764
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,440
yeah i've had i've had a few problems

765
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,960
but very very few problems very rare

766
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,320
to have problems with the fox that's

767
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,880
just maybe i have heard of people not

768
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,278
having

769
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,799
good experiences with that soil but no

770
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:10,159
the fact that the roots organic has

771
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:11,759
nutrients in it so you're probably not

772
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,480
doing any sort of feeding for

773
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:16,158
what the first 30 40 days depending on

774
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,880
how much you're transplanting and stuff

775
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,400
or

776
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,000
yeah that's pretty good keeps it kind of

777
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,200
easy huh so do you start off in like a

778
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,640
small container and then work your way

779
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,440
up to that seven gallon that you spoke

780
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,600
about

781
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,038
yeah exactly so especially with the

782
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,719
photos i i

783
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:30,640
always start off in like a solo cup

784
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,319
coming from out the cloner

785
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,840
going to a solo cup and they literally

786
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:36,000
stay in the solar car forever

787
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,359
like i got plants that'd be like three

788
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,200
feet tall and it's low

789
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,119
like and i literally put nutrients in

790
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,319
the solo cup and just put it right on

791
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,558
top of this water

792
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,480
because i'd be so busy but yeah i put in

793
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:49,278
the solo cup and uh

794
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,839
i try to keep it i try to uh go into one

795
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:51,759
gallon

796
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,918
i like to go in between a one gallon

797
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:56,640
before i go into the seven

798
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,240
so i go from like the solo to one gallon

799
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,159
uh after it just

800
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,919
looks like it's dying off then i keep it

801
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,760
in one gallon to death

802
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,000
like you said i just i just really meant

803
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:07,200
every 30 days but if i'm not

804
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,599
if i'm not flipping the flower or

805
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,360
anything like that i'll just i'll remain

806
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:12,079
with some dry nutrients but every 30

807
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:14,959
days

808
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:16,079
with the with the soil um they i don't

809
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,960
i'm not feeding at all

810
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,639
just i try to keep the water around 6.5

811
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,600
to 6.8

812
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,880
uh and i just plant ph water the first

813
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,199
30 days

814
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,520
after that 30 days if they're going into

815
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,798
flower or they're going into another pot

816
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,038
if they're getting transplanted they

817
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,079
don't get fed so that's what i love too

818
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,000
that's why i try to

819
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,519
try to keep everything around those same

820
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,038
time periods too so

821
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,960
like if it's around that time ready to

822
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,240
transplant then i'll

823
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,960
i'll wait it all the way out and then

824
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,159
when i transplant they can go another

825
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,759
they can go another 30 days and

826
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,240
and then i try and keep it right around

827
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,679
so if i had to go in the flower which i

828
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,919
still have the

829
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,679
i said i'd defeat them but if they're

830
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,278
going to flower i still try to keep it

831
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,720
right at that 30 day limit so i know

832
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:01,839
that they ate all those vegetative

833
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,360
nutrients

834
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,519
and they was ready for new nutrients and

835
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:06,639
stuff like that i really ever only have

836
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,440
to feed

837
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,720
mostly flour nutrients i barely ever use

838
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,200
my

839
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,360
my vegetative dry nutrients so which

840
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,480
nutrients are you using

841
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,759
i use down to earth dry nutrients so i

842
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,038
only use a few of

843
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:25,278
the four four four the four

844
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:26,640
eight rosen flower that's why i use the

845
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:29,119
flower

846
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,679
i use boneville as a halfway through

847
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:35,359
flower

848
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,360
flower boost um it has 3 and 15

849
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:42,879
phosphorus and zero potassium

850
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:45,599
and then i use i use their dolomite lime

851
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,799
every once in a while too so just those

852
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:50,079
just those four

853
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:52,079
so you're fully organic then right yes

854
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:54,558
now that's something i'm really big on i

855
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:58,399
don't i i don't agree with chemicals

856
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:59,918
um and mainly because my hair too

857
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,240
like and like the things i do with my

858
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,919
body i a lot of things i do in my body i

859
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,640
don't use any type of chemicals in my

860
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,720
hair

861
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,080
i don't eat chemicals i don't use things

862
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,480
with petroleum

863
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:11,599
uh things like that so i i carry that

864
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,319
over into

865
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,639
it to growing the plants as well i i

866
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,158
like to stay away from chemicals

867
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,919
and just try and keep it completely

868
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,799
organic things that you can get from the

869
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,278
ground

870
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:24,000
because i believe i like i'm a real

871
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:25,759
heavy on

872
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,079
i'm gonna also have you in like

873
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,240
apocalyptic situations too

874
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,240
and i know i want to still be able to do

875
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,240
this like i have to like have their

876
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,399
apocalypses so you want to be able to

877
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,640
i like to look up a lot of ways to like

878
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:40,719
get natural nitrogen natural phosphorus

879
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,120
and potassium and stuff like that

880
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,240
and just keep everything organic gotcha

881
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,239
i know a lot of people

882
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,278
down to earth is very very popular and

883
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,000
actually not a lot of people that are

884
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:50,319
kind of looking

885
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,839
for instructions on how to use it they

886
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,439
don't give very good clear instructions

887
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,278
on how to use it can you just

888
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,038
mention one a little bit more like how

889
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:59,759
you apply that

890
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:01,119
down to it when you apply it so yeah

891
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:04,240
like i said with the dirt

892
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,519
every 30 days now if i do need to

893
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,519
if they're going to get the vegetative

894
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,639
nutrients then i'll do two tablespoons

895
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,558
per gallon

896
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,240
of the vegetable nutrients per gallon

897
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:13,839
pot that they're in so if they're in the

898
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,038
5 gallon pot then they'll get 10

899
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,879
tablespoons

900
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:18,640
mean they had to be every 30 days if

901
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,159
they're going to stay in that pot

902
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,640
uh when they get flip when they get

903
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,440
switched to flour the day of flour no

904
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,960
matter

905
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,960
when they got switched no matter how

906
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,798
long ago they got vegetative nutrients i

907
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,919
give them two tablespoons

908
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:35,119
per gallon of 484 period

909
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,799
and and then halfway through flower like

910
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:39,839
maybe late week for

911
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:43,839
early week five i'll give them

912
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:46,639
75 484 and then i'll give them 25

913
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:48,639
bone meal and so basically they're still

914
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,919
getting the two tablespoons per gallon

915
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,000
no matter what

916
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,000
but i'll add that up and then i'll break

917
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,359
it down 75 percent

918
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,038
of the 484 and then 25 bone meal so like

919
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,719
if it was a five gallon pot

920
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,200
and i was doing two tablespoons per

921
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,600
gallon they would get seven and a half

922
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,759
uh tablespoons of the 484 and then they

923
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:09,519
would get two and a half tablespoons

924
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,440
of the bone meal so they still got the

925
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,200
exact same well

926
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,278
i just like to give him a little boost

927
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,399
at the end of the second half of the

928
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:18,159
flower period

929
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:19,759
that makes sense and i know you also do

930
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,559
microbes too right you inoculate with

931
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:25,359
microbes yeah you're using a recharge

932
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,879
yes anything other than recharge or just

933
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:28,240
recharge and what's your what how do you

934
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,720
apply the recharge

935
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,038
i started off using ruth's organic

936
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,720
organism xl

937
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:36,640
and then i started to recharge the only

938
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,679
reason i they both exactly the same for

939
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,000
me

940
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,360
they both recharged didn't do any better

941
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,679
than organism exhale

942
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:45,839
the only difference was that was very

943
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,759
important is that that organism exhale

944
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,319
clumps and it gets really hard

945
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,200
and it like turns into like these like

946
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:52,798
rocks

947
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,480
and then it's like basically it takes

948
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:55,839
you half the time trying to break it

949
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,480
down so that you can feed it to the

950
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,918
plant

951
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,519
and the recharge doesn't do that it

952
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,240
stays in that powdery farm the whole

953
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,879
time

954
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,640
but the the microbes are extremely

955
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,440
important i found that

956
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:11,600
having having a good micro micro uh

957
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,798
life in the soil however you put it

958
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:14,798
microbiology

959
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:16,798
living with the soil living with those

960
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:18,398
microbes in it is very important for

961
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:20,960
breaking down the

962
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:22,319
the um organic having the organic

963
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,759
nutrients that i use

964
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,519
it works hand in hand with the dry

965
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:28,640
nutrients though

966
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:30,158
that those are that's that's my uh

967
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,320
that's the only thing i do those dry

968
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,600
nutrients and

969
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:36,000
the recharge micros once a week a pa is

970
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:38,319
water

971
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,440
and that's it nothing that's probably

972
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,359
more than enough

973
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,120
yeah not too bad and talking about

974
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:44,000
microbes it's

975
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:45,599
you know we're talking about making

976
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,480
things easy maybe saving some money

977
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,079
things like that

978
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,839
microbes you know when you're growing

979
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,439
the organic side like you mentioned

980
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:52,879
they're so important so that might not

981
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,480
be something that you kind of want to

982
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,000
skimp out on right so

983
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,519
yeah you're going to get a lot better

984
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,558
results if you do have those microbes

985
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,038
breaking down right

986
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:02,240
so yeah that's a good call out so

987
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:04,240
recharge using

988
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,519
just in flowering or using throughout

989
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,839
the whole group

990
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,278
i use the whole time it's most important

991
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:11,599
for me in flower

992
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:13,359
i make sure i never miss a feeding of

993
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:14,959
recharging flower but i do use it the

994
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:17,199
whole time

995
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,120
but sometimes i'm a little more relaxed

996
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,840
about using it in vids

997
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,359
just because it's not the best plans

998
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,918
kind of growth like

999
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,199
veggies that advance time is time for

1000
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,159
them to heal they're able to heal

1001
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,278
themselves

1002
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,919
they're able to recover and like like

1003
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:34,398
it's it's

1004
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,960
more of a much more relaxing time like

1005
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:36,558
there's

1006
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,038
it's like once you get into flowers like

1007
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:39,599
a race so like like then during that

1008
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:41,359
time

1009
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,678
they i make sure they get recharged

1010
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:45,278
every week on on the dot like there's no

1011
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,600
missing no recharges

1012
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,359
and it's crazy because i like it works

1013
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:51,359
really well because you can see

1014
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:52,558
it says it on the back like noticeably

1015
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:53,839
you'll notice the difference in your

1016
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:55,519
plants you do

1017
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:57,038
you do they'd be really happy like the

1018
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,880
next day

1019
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,480
yeah absolutely and not having the

1020
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,600
microbes and veg i mean

1021
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,558
if you're working with a quality bag of

1022
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,558
soil

1023
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:07,759
right it already has those microbes in

1024
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,558
there to start it's gonna be enough for

1025
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,038
the first

1026
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:12,879
30 40 days or whatever so yeah keeping

1027
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,919
it easy just just inoculating the flour

1028
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,760
i like it how about plant

1029
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,120
training let's switch it up to that

1030
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:19,759
let's talk about what do you typically

1031
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:22,639
do for

1032
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:24,000
plant training throughout the grow plant

1033
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,120
training so

1034
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,079
yeah um with the plants plant training

1035
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,479
depending on what i'm doing

1036
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,199
so i found that with the photo periods

1037
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,240
well this is all in keeping it easy so

1038
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,240
for me topping and low stress training i

1039
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,759
get very equal results from topping the

1040
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,480
low search training

1041
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:44,480
the difference is is that low stress is

1042
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,798
less stressful and i've noticed that

1043
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,480
eating topping the plant can stress it

1044
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,759
out and it can be droopy

1045
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,519
especially if you got more than one

1046
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:54,000
topping you type in all the tops

1047
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,798
it can't stress plan on getting droopy

1048
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,319
and so i

1049
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,960
i don't i don't like to um i don't like

1050
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:01,200
to top

1051
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,480
autoflowers a lot of people say

1052
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,519
autoflowers they don't want to stress

1053
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,360
them out too much

1054
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,880
so i strictly train them and this is

1055
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:10,240
because i've noticed

1056
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,320
stress from from top of the plant at the

1057
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,599
same time i've broken the entire top off

1058
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:14,960
of an autoflower

1059
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:16,639
and it still is my second highest

1060
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,519
yielding plant from that growth

1061
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,120
so i don't always know but i i try to

1062
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,720
stay away from

1063
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,639
from stretching out the all the flowers

1064
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,720
as much as possible um

1065
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,320
but topping is way easier it's really

1066
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,919
easy just the top of a plant

1067
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,839
then having to pull out all these plant

1068
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,038
ties and bending the plant over trying

1069
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,519
not to break it

1070
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:37,200
tying it down like that that could be a

1071
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,640
lot more work than just pinching off the

1072
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,880
top and being done with it

1073
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,399
so with the photos i i just strictly top

1074
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,960
the photos

1075
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:47,599
i don't really do too much anything else

1076
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,600
unless one of them starts to grow

1077
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:50,959
too much farther too much taller than

1078
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:52,000
the rest then i'll do some super

1079
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,840
cropping

1080
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,519
just to bend it down and bring it back

1081
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:57,759
down to the same level

1082
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,278
but i strictly just top my photo period

1083
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:00,398
plans i top them like three or four

1084
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:02,558
times too like

1085
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:04,558
i top it once at the top once it gets

1086
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,398
the two tops i top both of those

1087
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:08,079
and then i let it grow all the four

1088
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:08,960
times and i top off four of those times

1089
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,200
and that's it

1090
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,358
after that it bushes out that i usually

1091
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,199
get it it's usually about time to get it

1092
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:17,440
under the scrog net

1093
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,279
for the photo period plan so that's

1094
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,800
about all i do for the photo periods and

1095
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,440
once they get big enough

1096
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,359
in the 4x4 i do use a scrog now i will

1097
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,440
utilize this crossnet

1098
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,918
because it does help with light

1099
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,599
penetration and maximizing the yield

1100
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,239
i found that when you spread those

1101
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,720
plants out

1102
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,479
they will replace tops like if you've

1103
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,918
been in top now it will replace it with

1104
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,039
two more tiles even if you're not

1105
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,279
pinching them

1106
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:45,440
like if you remove the top out the way

1107
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,519
it'll allow another top to get to grow

1108
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,280
to where that is so i love to put the

1109
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,800
i love to take that strong then and bend

1110
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,159
on all those main tops

1111
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,839
and then you and then there's always a

1112
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,919
bunch of small leaves

1113
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,279
like small tops that's right at the top

1114
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,759
of the straw

1115
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,680
and and in a couple of weeks when those

1116
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,320
other tops are bent over as those grow

1117
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:06,159
back up those small tops grew up as well

1118
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,320
and then now you got a whole bunch more

1119
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:10,879
tops and i like to use the three inch

1120
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,760
the three inch uh scrog net for that and

1121
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,599
then after that

1122
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,000
once i fill that up and i try to

1123
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,240
strategically sometimes though i have

1124
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,239
gotten away i have uh

1125
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,078
recently gotten away from trying to fill

1126
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:24,159
up every single square

1127
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,599
that was a big deal for me at first but

1128
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:26,480
i found that's another thing it's not

1129
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,720
that serious

1130
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,599
i don't filling up every single square

1131
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,480
versus not

1132
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,760
every square but getting most of them

1133
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,800
and i haven't really

1134
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,880
suffered my yield too much so all right

1135
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,119
let's just try to keep the work easy uh

1136
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,440
after that i put a six inch uh

1137
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,039
square scroggin on just to hold them up

1138
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,320
that's it

1139
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:48,320
you know all the last thing i love

1140
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,119
stretch training all those but that is

1141
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,320
so

1142
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:55,599
low stress training is is so

1143
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,280
is so much work because they they grow

1144
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,359
out of it so fast

1145
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,880
and like you load stairs training and

1146
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:02,000
then come back the next day and they've

1147
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,000
all grown up

1148
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,199
and i've even had plans like rip out of

1149
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,880
the tires and

1150
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:08,559
like you literally have to keep tying

1151
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,760
them down every single day and they just

1152
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,239
keep growing and

1153
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,160
it's an everyday thing so i tried to

1154
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:15,439
stay away from those frustrating

1155
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:17,199
this is why i tried to stay away from

1156
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,480
all the fire i got my autoflowers kind

1157
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:20,159
of hard

1158
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,519
like this just in those things just

1159
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:23,679
talking like that like

1160
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:24,880
it makes it a little bit harder right i

1161
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:27,679
totally get what you mean

1162
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,838
i do a similar technique for topping you

1163
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:31,598
know i'll do the main top then i'll top

1164
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:33,440
those tops and then i'll top again so

1165
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,800
eight main colors or 16

1166
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,800
colas depending on how many times you

1167
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,240
top but you know one thing i've

1168
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,599
challenged myself to do when it comes to

1169
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,719
low stress training because i like to do

1170
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,160
the topping

1171
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,239
and then do low stress training along

1172
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:46,879
with it to try to keep the canopy even

1173
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,879
at that point

1174
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:51,119
you gotta fly after going after you

1175
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,119
right now

1176
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,000
but uh you know as i'm bending them down

1177
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,760
doing low stress training i'm

1178
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,358
challenging myself more and more to just

1179
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,720
bend with my hands and then use no ties

1180
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,279
and i've actually been getting away with

1181
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:07,039
it and just bending it now

1182
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,960
yes it's gonna be beneficial to get in

1183
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:09,599
there twice a day and do the hand

1184
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,960
bending

1185
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,079
you can get away with once a day you

1186
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,559
might not have as much good of a

1187
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,240
canopy just doing it once a day but it's

1188
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:20,078
definitely possible to get away with low

1189
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:21,759
straight chaining without ties

1190
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,400
for sure yeah definitely it definitely

1191
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,560
is i did i've done that a few times

1192
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,680
and then i know you do some defoliation

1193
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:29,358
too right so

1194
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,358
uh you [ __ ] up some of these every now

1195
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:34,400
and then when you usually do that

1196
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:36,078
oh now defoliation the foliage is very

1197
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,000
important too uh

1198
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,920
i forgot about that so like well all

1199
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,519
those with all of the info up here i

1200
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,000
defoliate all of them

1201
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:47,358
in the beginning i used to i used to not

1202
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,400
defoliate the autoflowers barely at all

1203
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:52,719
but one of my girls i particularly

1204
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,920
did it on purpose and i i did it in my

1205
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:55,598
normal defoliation

1206
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,280
because i don't do too much defoliation

1207
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,200
period like i'm still

1208
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,440
always with photos or auto i'm still

1209
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:04,559
very selective about it just to keep the

1210
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,559
the top sides uncovered but one of my

1211
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,078
all those girls i actually particularly

1212
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:08,719
just went ahead and just was like i'm

1213
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,039
just gonna

1214
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,879
defoliate like i normally would and i

1215
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,880
had no issues out of it oh so i

1216
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,838
defoliate all my plans

1217
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,440
i try to keep the big families all the

1218
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:22,480
families get really big

1219
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,920
i take them off um i like the uh

1220
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,838
you know like when they they start

1221
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,599
getting the granddaddy families like

1222
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:29,440
like those huge families that's been

1223
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,838
there for those families i take those

1224
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,800
offers

1225
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:32,559
the ones i've been there from the

1226
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,839
beginning and i just try to keep the

1227
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:36,400
huge ones going

1228
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:37,440
and like the the regular sized families

1229
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,358
that they grow

1230
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,559
like they like they grow new families

1231
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,719
and stuff like as they grow

1232
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,480
tops then they grow new families and

1233
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,239
like i like the new tops to keep those

1234
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,400
they families and so like

1235
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:50,078
as the plan gets older i take the old

1236
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,000
families and i just let it

1237
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,440
develop new families and as it gets

1238
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,519
bigger and bushes out

1239
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,440
as those older families that's super

1240
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:00,159
huge and those times got really long

1241
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,880
i'll take all of those families again

1242
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:03,519
and just keep

1243
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,200
i just keep doing that same routine and

1244
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:06,800
i do that to the autoflowers too and i

1245
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:09,199
have no issues out of

1246
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,200
yeah that makes sense uh i do it's

1247
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,399
similar you know i am defoliating

1248
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:14,239
particularly within the first three

1249
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,440
weeks of flowers when i'll pluck off the

1250
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:16,719
leaves and then

1251
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,800
after the stretching period once they're

1252
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:19,118
done stretching you know the buds fatten

1253
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,359
up

1254
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,559
i don't like to pluck off leaves during

1255
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:24,078
that time period that's just me

1256
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:26,159
i know people do it all the time they

1257
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,519
get away with it so on and so forth but

1258
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,279
that's just me and then sometimes like

1259
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:31,599
towards the very end of flowering like

1260
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,920
day 45 of flowering right like a week

1261
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,440
before two weeks before harvest

1262
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,119
i'll get in there and i'll do

1263
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,079
defoliation kind of on the middle of the

1264
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,680
canopy

1265
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,359
um so like you get down in and that

1266
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:42,239
helps with the finishing in my opinion

1267
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:45,199
so

1268
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:46,799
that's kind of what i do there how about

1269
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:49,199
let's switch it up and talk about

1270
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,160
pests what do you do do you do anything

1271
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:52,000
at all to prevent

1272
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,920
pests from i know you get a house fly

1273
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,960
running around there

1274
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,838
and you've got your grow tent right

1275
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,000
behind you

1276
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:00,960
what do you do to uh prevent pests if

1277
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,400
anything

1278
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,679
well the uh now i try to i like the

1279
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,519
nematodes

1280
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:09,598
oh i went through a lot of different

1281
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:12,639
things with the pests i tried uh

1282
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,519
neem neem oil and the neem oil works

1283
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:16,159
really great

1284
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:18,159
but it smells horrible and it just then

1285
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:20,559
it has a really strong smell

1286
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,239
and so like it works really good but it

1287
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:24,078
filled your entire house your whole

1288
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:25,919
house would smell like nemo and you

1289
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,079
can't use the door flower

1290
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,680
so then i got away from nemo i started

1291
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,720
using mosquito bits

1292
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:35,199
mosquito bits work pretty well um

1293
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:37,679
but not great for spider mites i've

1294
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:40,799
tried i've had fungus a million times

1295
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:41,919
and i've had i've only had spider mites

1296
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,000
once

1297
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:49,280
so the neem oil spray worked okay

1298
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,679
um it worked great for the spider mites

1299
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,760
and the they weren't great for in the

1300
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:55,358
[ __ ] snacks while i was in veg

1301
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,839
but it wasn't really much i could do for

1302
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:59,279
them uh once it was in flower and they

1303
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:02,000
still came back

1304
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,680
um so after i got away from doing that

1305
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,239
then i said i started using the mosquito

1306
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:05,919
ducts

1307
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:07,919
the skilled dogs didn't do anything at

1308
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,240
all obviously for spider mites but they

1309
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,440
were

1310
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:13,279
good for a little bit for uh fungus nuts

1311
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,480
um but they still kept coming back from

1312
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,960
that's all relentless

1313
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,719
um so then i started getting into uh

1314
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,280
using nematodes

1315
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:22,559
and nematodes work really well too um

1316
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,119
but you have to be

1317
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:26,559
uh diligent with them as well and keep

1318
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,920
dosing them because they still come back

1319
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:30,480
and fungus that's

1320
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,119
that fungus knives come back so easily

1321
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,880
and

1322
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,160
and then these then flies too i like to

1323
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,559
keep uh

1324
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,920
i like to keep fly traps up in an easy

1325
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:40,400
grow tent too

1326
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,838
uh i don't know i don't know where all

1327
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,760
these flies just came from

1328
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:46,318
just today because they all came today

1329
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,319
to bother me

1330
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:50,639
so i actually went and got some more uh

1331
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:52,639
sticky chops i love to keep the sticky

1332
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:54,960
chops up too just a little just so that

1333
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,639
it alerts you to what you got going on

1334
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,559
uh because you don't really you don't

1335
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,078
really notice the fungus that's real

1336
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:01,358
unless until you come to water the

1337
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,359
plants and you water them and then the

1338
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:05,199
fungus gets flying around

1339
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:06,799
um but i love to come in every day and

1340
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:08,000
just take a look at the sticky chops and

1341
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,680
see what's on them

1342
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,920
and then you'll know that you got other

1343
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:14,960
things i haven't had spiderman

1344
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,200
spider mites again since then though

1345
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,720
um so i've been pretty good i haven't

1346
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:23,439
i've been pretty

1347
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:25,598
pretty blessed with the um with the uh

1348
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,880
pests except for the fungus i haven't

1349
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,240
had anything else

1350
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,440
yeah i was gonna mention the yellow

1351
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:30,159
stickies because i've seen those in your

1352
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,318
videos

1353
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:34,719
and you know trying to keep things

1354
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,239
simple sticky put just sticky traps up

1355
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,679
is kind of an easy thing that you can do

1356
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:40,000
in order to

1357
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,358
help catch the fungus gnats so you can

1358
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
kind of see and then take action from

1359
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:43,358
there

1360
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,440
now you're growing organically the

1361
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:47,920
medium needs to be moist at all times

1362
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,960
it's no surprise that fungus gnats will

1363
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,639
will come at you

1364
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,199
a lot right they thrive in that wet

1365
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,480
medium on that top layer there so having

1366
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:57,118
those sticky traps there

1367
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,000
they're so key and like you said i mean

1368
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,680
they could just invade

1369
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,358
so quickly and then before you know it

1370
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:02,960
you get the fungus damage on

1371
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:04,880
the leaves like the yellowing and the

1372
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,880
leaves and like those circle

1373
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,079
uh spots the rust spots just all the

1374
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,960
leaves and you know you have fungus

1375
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,800
gnats and

1376
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,240
it gets really bad really out of control

1377
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,920
and those yellow sticky traps are an

1378
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:17,598
easy way to at least catch to identify

1379
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,880
and also helps remove some of them right

1380
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,800
because they're getting trapped into

1381
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,640
dying there so

1382
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,640
cool yeah that's awesome i know what

1383
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:25,920
kind of flipping things around here kind

1384
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:27,679
of getting all over the place one other

1385
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,680
thing i wanted to talk about was

1386
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,039
i think that i saw in your video it's

1387
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:32,480
not on the list of questions that i gave

1388
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:33,358
you but i figured it would be good to

1389
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,240
bring up here

1390
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:36,960
because i thought it was pretty

1391
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:38,239
interesting was the after you harvest

1392
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,920
right

1393
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:42,239
you do your trimming or whatever and

1394
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,119
you're putting it into actually a vacuum

1395
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:44,479
seal

1396
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,480
can you talk to me a little bit about

1397
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,519
that you said you had a lot of success

1398
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,039
doing that right

1399
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:50,800
so that's something that that's

1400
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:53,679
something that i discovered

1401
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,000
recently it wasn't funny i can't explain

1402
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:59,039
exactly how i discovered it

1403
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,358
but basically basically i needed to

1404
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:04,079
figure out

1405
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:06,838
how the product was going to be after

1406
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:10,000
being vacuumed still for like a week

1407
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:12,000
so it's all i don't normally do i just

1408
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,519
i just happened to just do it this one

1409
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,760
time and uh

1410
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:17,119
and so before i did what i did i just

1411
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,640
wanted to make sure

1412
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:21,200
that it wasn't gonna be destroyed

1413
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:22,400
afterwards so i just wanted to check so

1414
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:24,960
i uh

1415
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,039
so as i did what i did i took some more

1416
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,559
implants and i put them i vacuum sealed

1417
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:31,838
them

1418
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:33,279
and then i left it in there until

1419
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:34,960
the other thing that i was doing was

1420
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,040
ready and

1421
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,880
and then i came back to check to see how

1422
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:40,639
i was see how it turned out

1423
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,920
i actually took i actually experimented

1424
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:45,759
with two ways i took them

1425
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,559
i took a bud and put it inside of like a

1426
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,800
regular mylar bag and sealed it and then

1427
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:50,639
i

1428
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,318
actually vacuum sealed some of it in

1429
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:53,118
inside of a vacuum seal and sucked all

1430
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:55,838
the air out

1431
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,800
and then sealed it that way now in

1432
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:59,599
detroit

1433
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,880
in detroit we got this stuff that we got

1434
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,400
this stuff that a lot of people like to

1435
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,920
call his eyes

1436
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,079
or exotics and basically

1437
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,559
basically the way that they do it is

1438
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:14,640
more so

1439
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:17,358
it's more so chemicals and stuff

1440
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:18,559
that they uh they give it this really

1441
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:21,679
tight look

1442
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:24,799
and it's really this really strong smell

1443
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:26,239
so after after this week was up and i

1444
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,480
opened this pack

1445
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:30,719
i was completely blown away because like

1446
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,079
i was like oh my god like i like it turn

1447
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:34,959
to exactly

1448
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,599
like like it literally like got really

1449
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,000
tight

1450
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:40,400
and then it smells like extremely strong

1451
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,358
and i opened it up and i was just like

1452
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,680
why what did i what did i just do like

1453
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:46,239
and

1454
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:48,239
i did it again then i harvested another

1455
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:51,118
plant i did it again

1456
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:52,318
and so are you letting them dry you're

1457
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,440
harvesting and then letting them dry

1458
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:55,519
then trimming or are you just

1459
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,119
trimming and then going well i actually

1460
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,880
uh so i trim it

1461
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,480
and then i put it in a jar i leave it in

1462
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,640
the jar for a week i'll let it cure

1463
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,719
normally before a week uh just cause

1464
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:06,078
it'll still be kind of soft still

1465
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:07,598
and like i feel like i'll be scared to

1466
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,000
do it right in there like i feel like

1467
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,160
it's gonna

1468
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,280
let's crush it completely so i'll let it

1469
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:13,519
i let it cure like

1470
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,800
regularly for a week and then i go to

1471
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:16,800
the vacuum seal and

1472
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,480
and i just squish to make sure it's and

1473
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,079
you got to have it you got to start like

1474
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,800
a good material so your material need to

1475
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,839
be

1476
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,920
a decently dense material already uh

1477
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:27,358
like and like because i've had i've

1478
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,039
tried to do it with

1479
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:30,960
like i've had like an auto that didn't

1480
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:31,679
grow as great and it was it was kind of

1481
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,838
fluffy

1482
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,960
and i tried that and it did not work it

1483
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:36,639
just crushed it and

1484
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,559
even after letting it cure for a week

1485
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:41,118
it's still crushed so

1486
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,559
like it still has to be decent a decent

1487
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,760
uh plant

1488
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:47,519
that's a that's a decent decent distance

1489
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,720
that can withstand the strength

1490
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:53,039
of it being squashed like that but yeah

1491
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:54,799
after a week regular cure in the jar put

1492
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:56,960
in a vacuum seal and i only do it for

1493
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,039
one week literally only one week

1494
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,639
and it's just it's just to compact it

1495
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:03,358
like that and then it just

1496
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:04,318
it does something to the smell like like

1497
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:06,559
i it's

1498
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:08,000
it's almost like it just like it's

1499
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:10,960
almost like it traps

1500
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,960
everything inside and like once you open

1501
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,800
it up it never loses it like

1502
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,119
like and i and i take it out after that

1503
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,280
week i break it all down like i was and

1504
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:21,838
then i put it back in the jar and i just

1505
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,200
i continue curing just like normal and

1506
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:24,318
just like normal and it continues to

1507
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:27,118
carry normally

1508
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:29,440
but it just i just do it for the look

1509
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,400
and and that smell it just boosts the

1510
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,240
smell

1511
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,440
like i can't t i can't i'm not gonna lie

1512
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:34,719
i sit here and say that it makes it

1513
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,920
smoke any better

1514
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:39,838
uh because it doesn't and like like it

1515
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,599
smells this is great either way

1516
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:45,199
but like but for the appeal

1517
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,000
it definitely does it definitely does

1518
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:49,919
something for the appeal especially with

1519
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
in my city a lot of people are looking

1520
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,680
for and like it does that

1521
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,079
i'm not even sure if that's how they do

1522
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:57,679
it or not because it seems like that's

1523
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,599
how they've been doing it

1524
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:01,279
because it literally did that it was

1525
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,519
pretty cool so i've been doing that

1526
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,319
ever since just one week vacuum still a

1527
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:07,679
week and then back to the jar man

1528
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:10,000
i've been doing that with everything is

1529
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:11,440
it the recipe i like it

1530
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,559
yeah i can imagine the video that you

1531
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,599
showed it looked like it was tightening

1532
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,599
up those buds

1533
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,280
quite a bit so yeah as far as peggy i

1534
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,800
mean it makes total sense so i thought

1535
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,000
that was interesting fair bring that up

1536
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,240
on here in case anybody

1537
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,920
either wanted to know that as a tip or

1538
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:24,239
if maybe some people were already doing

1539
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,920
that

1540
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:27,358
and they know about that but it's not

1541
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,599
something we normally see

1542
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:31,279
yeah and i couldn't find no information

1543
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,838
on it myself either

1544
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,280
it was one of those things that i had to

1545
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:37,440
like i had to come up with that little

1546
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,160
routine myself because i researched it

1547
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,760
hard

1548
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:41,519
like i thought i did that that one time

1549
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,359
i did a lot of research like

1550
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:45,280
how should i do it should i go straight

1551
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:47,440
from the plant should i trim

1552
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,319
like how long should i dry how long

1553
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,079
should i leave it

1554
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:51,199
i couldn't find no information on it so

1555
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,559
it was something i just had to

1556
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,399
experiment with

1557
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,760
and so like you said if anybody wants to

1558
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,599
do what i did

1559
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:01,680
uh i explained one more time i trimmed

1560
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,519
cured regularly in the jar for a week

1561
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:04,318
vacuum still leave it back yourself for

1562
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:06,400
a week

1563
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:08,318
and go back to a jar for the remainder

1564
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,200
of the curious cycle huh that's it

1565
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:12,880
all right well i know that most you're

1566
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:14,639
following those a lot of followers of

1567
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,240
yours that are beginners and they're

1568
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:17,440
following you do a great job with kind

1569
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:19,358
of explaining things

1570
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,358
you know step by step on your channel by

1571
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:23,598
the way

1572
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,960
that being said you probably get a ton

1573
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,359
of questions from beginners

1574
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,159
so on and so forth what advice do you

1575
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:30,400
have

1576
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:31,759
for people who are just starting out

1577
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,200
advice i have for people that just

1578
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,800
starting out

1579
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:38,639
is go for it uh jump into it and get

1580
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:42,160
your first girl started

1581
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:45,279
i spent a lot of time a lot of time

1582
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:48,078
confusing myself and harping over

1583
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,599
how i should do it what should i do am i

1584
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:53,039
doing it right

1585
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:55,359
like which sees like p like

1586
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:57,039
getting into growing is so frustrating

1587
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:59,838
like like it is so

1588
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:01,039
hard and so frustrating to get the

1589
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:03,440
information to get

1590
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:04,639
some type of solid information that you

1591
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,639
need

1592
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:08,239
to make you comfortable enough to pull

1593
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:10,558
the trigger on what you want to do

1594
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:11,919
it's so hard like like you'll never be

1595
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,040
comfortable enough with the information

1596
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,800
that you get

1597
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:16,239
and what i learned from that is just to

1598
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,680
do it and

1599
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:23,118
and learn from doing it and

1600
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:25,759
and that's the best way i've learned and

1601
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:28,400
it and a lot of a lot of stuff about the

1602
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,079
way that my channel is is because

1603
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,760
it was it's because a lot of that stuff

1604
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,359
was hard for me

1605
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,680
to come across like a lot of information

1606
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:38,719
that was hard to come across from me

1607
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:41,358
and and a lot about like

1608
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:41,919
me being simple and so mine a lot about

1609
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:44,960
that too

1610
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:47,119
is is uh is

1611
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,800
it was really hard for me like like when

1612
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,079
i first started i was trying to build an

1613
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,760
ebb and flow table

1614
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,280
they had me trying to build an ebb and

1615
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,839
flow table for flower

1616
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,400
they had me trying to build a a draining

1617
00:50:55,838 --> 00:51:00,719
field

1618
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,838
uh um it was crazy it was like one of

1619
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:03,838
them was going to be at ebbing flow

1620
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:05,440
where they flood the whole table

1621
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:07,679
and then drain and the other one was

1622
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,800
like a dripper the veg system was like a

1623
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:11,039
dripper system

1624
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,640
and like it had all these leaves it is

1625
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:14,159
water pumping all this stuff that the

1626
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:14,960
guy was making good otherwise all these

1627
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:16,639
videos

1628
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,000
this dude told me it was the best way

1629
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:18,960
like everybody say their weight is the

1630
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,480
best way too

1631
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,159
the only way you gonna know is just to

1632
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,280
go ahead and do it and

1633
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:25,440
figure out what's comfortable for

1634
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,359
yourself there's nobody that's going to

1635
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,960
be able to tell you

1636
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:30,239
what's comfortable and what's the best

1637
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,720
way they're going to say it's the best

1638
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:37,519
way but it may not be the best for you

1639
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:40,000
and so don't don't don't get too uh

1640
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:42,159
too caught up on everything just do it i

1641
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,159
i live my life that way i just jump into

1642
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:45,759
it and do it and i learn from there

1643
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:47,838
that's really good advice yeah there are

1644
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,000
so many different ways to grow

1645
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:51,279
and it can become so overwhelming it's

1646
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,400
like just do it try it

1647
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,559
do what you think best adjust every part

1648
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,079
every single part of growing there's a

1649
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,400
different million different ways to do

1650
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,119
