1
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:07,759
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,839
know me my name is chris

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,599
aka mr growit and i'm back with another

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,000
video in this video i want to talk about

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,759
security cameras in your grow space

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,559
specifically the light that security

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,760
cameras admit

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,919
so i had a grower reach out to me

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,240
recently and he had mentioned that

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,600
he has security cameras in his grow tent

11
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,079
and he swears that

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,080
his plants won't hermie because of the

13
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,518
security camera the light that it emits

14
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,799
i personally do not come across this and

15
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:31,358
i don't really have the knowledge to

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,439
know

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,559
whether or not this type of light from

18
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,320
security cameras

19
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,919
will impact plant growth or not so i

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,480
figured i'd reach out to a lighting

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,160
expert

22
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,000
and get their opinion on it so i hit up

23
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,319
dan from the green sunshine company

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,480
and got him on to a zoom call and here's

25
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,558
what he had to say

26
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,839
okay dan how's it going thanks for

27
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,839
joining me tonight

28
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,280
hey chris how you doing pretty good

29
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,120
pretty good thanks for uh thanks for

30
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,640
coming on um i got a good

31
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,079
lighting question for you something that

32
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,558
might actually stump you love landing

33
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,640
questions

34
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,759
so i i've had somebody reach out to me

35
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,239
quite recently

36
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,759
and his plants uh turned out to be a

37
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,799
hermaphrodite plant

38
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,680
and what his theory is

39
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,159
is um he recently found out that his

40
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,000
security cameras that he has in his grow

41
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,080
emit light so a lot of people don't know

42
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,159
that security cameras they emit light

43
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,438
ir light infrared light is what they

44
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,240
admit he

45
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,719
is uh confident that that turned his

46
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,719
plants

47
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,560
to be a hermaphrodite i want to reach

48
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,640
out to you because

49
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,000
you in particular because you own the

50
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,560
green sunshine company

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,400
you have a couple different grow lights

52
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,759
and one thing that you're real known for

53
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,159
and it's on your website

54
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,759
is the emerson effect and the emerson

55
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,118
effect for those that don't know

56
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,118
is basically it's a combination of ir

57
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,399
light as well as other lights on the

58
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,759
spectrum

59
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,879
results in faster growth photosynthesis

60
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,159
but i are alone i'm not sure if that

61
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,078
would actually trigger

62
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,359
the plant to do anything so i want to

63
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:00,158
kind of reach out to you today and get

64
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,280
your

65
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,079
uh thoughts on that one sure yeah that's

66
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,118
a really

67
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,399
great question because it's gonna help

68
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:12,239
you understand

69
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,000
how plants respond to light and

70
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,680
what i think is important to understand

71
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,560
is the plant has several

72
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
systems inside of it that may get

73
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,759
triggered by light

74
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,640
so you might think hey we're giving the

75
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,719
plant light

76
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,639
and like it is going to respond the

77
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,239
plant actually has several systems

78
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,759
inside of it that will

79
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,280
you know respond to light like whether

80
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,120
it knows it's going to sleep uh

81
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,199
using it as energy to grow it will

82
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,000
respond to it like a signal and also use

83
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,679
it as energy

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,280
so there's a few different things that

85
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,280
are going on here so

86
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,560
so so let's start with photosynthesis so

87
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,640
photosynthesis

88
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,479
um pretty much if you have a broad range

89
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,439
of light you know from

90
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,119
blue from uv to infrared if it's joined

91
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,239
with other colors it will

92
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,680
create growth um on its own only the

93
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,039
colors in the par range

94
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,239
will create growth if it's a single

95
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,840
color so if i was looking at a security

96
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,319
camera

97
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,439
if it would affect growth or not it

98
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,238
probably would not

99
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,400
just in terms of an intensity standpoint

100
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,920
so it may not be significant for any

101
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,760
sort of growth it's because it's not

102
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,318
significant

103
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,799
the other thing that touches on your

104
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,598
viewers question was the hermaphroditing

105
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,560
and uh there we're getting into the day

106
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,479
night system

107
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,959
okay so and that's the phytochrome

108
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:30,079
system so that is sensitive to

109
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,319
mostly blue light and red light

110
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,840
so that's exactly why you can go into

111
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:37,518
your grow room with the green

112
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,000
light and your plants don't wake up

113
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,080
because that green light is is not

114
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,919
picked up by that system so that system

115
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,239
doesn't even see it and it doesn't even

116
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,719
know

117
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,878
there's any light it may use that green

118
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,840
light for photosynthesis but it may not

119
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,158
wake up

120
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,400
so green light's interesting like that

121
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:57,039
same goes for infrared light it does not

122
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,799
wake up the phytochrome system so and

123
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,878
it's actually used infrared light is

124
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,560
used to put plants to sleep faster

125
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,798
so if you you can you can buy like

126
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,239
infrared pucks and turn them on

127
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,400
right after your lights turn off it'll

128
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,959
actually help your plants go to sleep

129
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,599
faster we won't get into the specifics

130
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,759
so

131
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,919
infrared at night is actually a good

132
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,839
thing like if you ever have like a light

133
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,238
flash in your room you want to dose your

134
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,159
plants

135
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,279
infrared so it'll make them go to sleep

136
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,759
even faster

137
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,119
so i took a uh you asked me this

138
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,879
question ahead of time and i

139
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,120
you give me a heads up and i actually

140
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,478
went back here into our office and i

141
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,600
took a spectro

142
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,519
uh uh i have a little apogee instrument

143
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,120
and i took a reading here and you can

144
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:41,039
see it's in the like 780 range

145
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,120
in grow lights normally uh what's

146
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,479
effective for growth is like

147
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,079
you know 700 720 740 and then after that

148
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,879
it really drops off

149
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,839
so this wouldn't really affect um growth

150
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,240
so much

151
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,638
um it i'm actually not sure if this

152
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,478
would affect the phytochrome system so

153
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,000
if this alone was in your grow room it

154
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:03,680
wouldn't be a bad thing

155
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,279
now if your light had like actually you

156
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,519
when you were viewing it if you had any

157
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,038
visible light that would be bad

158
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,120
especially if it was blue light because

159
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,879
generally blue leds are

160
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,720
very intense and that is the that is the

161
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,159
signal that your plant actually looks

162
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,280
for like that's the truest signal your

163
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,160
plant looks for for

164
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,198
the presence of light so blue light is

165
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,680
very bad

166
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,319
for any sort of day night thing so in

167
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,840
short

168
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,680
if you look at your security camera and

169
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,799
you can't visibly see any light

170
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,360
you're probably okay and if you see

171
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,840
light

172
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,439
definitely cover it up and then know

173
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,239
that your infrared sensor might be

174
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,839
somewhere else

175
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,280
so there's two two sources of light like

176
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,638
the indicator of the saying it's on or

177
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,038
the infrared sensor that

178
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,400
lets you have night vision so hopefully

179
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,519
that answers the question

180
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,198
uh did i miss anything chris do you have

181
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,120
any questions that i might have

182
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,560
missed no but i do have a follow-up

183
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,918
question that brings up a good point so

184
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,600
you said any other light

185
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,198
on top of that right so if there's a

186
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,039
status light

187
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,400
on the actual piece of equipment and

188
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:03,839
that's one thing that i've run into

189
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,198
before is i actually had a status light

190
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,918
for my humidifier

191
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,400
and my heater i have to cover them up so

192
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,560
those

193
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,679
just to confirm those will actually

194
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,160
cause your plants to

195
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,879
hurt me out if the those were to go

196
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,960
towards

197
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,038
um you know during the dark period yeah

198
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,758
you you never know so basically

199
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,279
always cover cover those up because like

200
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,879
even if it doesn't like why take the

201
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,119
chance so yeah cover those

202
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,000
uh status indicators up especially if

203
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,000
it's blue

204
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,038
