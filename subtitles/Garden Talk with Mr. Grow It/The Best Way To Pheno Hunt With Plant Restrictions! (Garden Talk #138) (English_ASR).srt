right man I'm doing all right just kind

70
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:42,039
of vibing going through the process uh

71
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:44,039
been looking forward to redoing this uh

72
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:46,840
but overall overall good everything's

73
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,239
fine redoing keywords we uh actually

74
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,360
went through and filmed this entire

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,080
episode already and then come to find

76
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,239
out there was an audio issue so this is

77
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,760
uh this is take two yeah hopefully we

78
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:58,640
can make it better though uh there were

79
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,239
a few things that I uh remembered

80
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,399
actually the day after that I was like

81
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,480
man I could have touched on that

82
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,360
expanded on this yeah let's make it

83
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,798
better this time around so we're going

84
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,640
to get into feno hunting today you are a

85
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,280
homeg grower and you have restrictions

86
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,598
you have a Max plant count so when you

87
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,280
feno hunt you have to do it with

88
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:19,639
limitations now many many people are in

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,360
the same boat as you for me my Max plant

90
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:24,919
count is 12 all right not bad I can deal

91
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,120
with that right that's pretty good yeah

92
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,958
but there are many states that have a a

93
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,438
six as Max plant count You' got most of

94
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,680
Canada four I say most because I believe

95
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:39,560
Manitoba is still fighting for hom grow

96
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,560
mhm you've got Montana two plants is

97
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,438
their Max so it can be really difficult

98
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,158
to fenal hunt with this particular

99
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,759
restriction but it's possible so let's

100
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,919
get into it we'll talk about fenal

101
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,639
hunting how you go about doing it and

102
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:54,078
doing it with a small plant count but

103
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,238
first can you tell us a little bit about

104
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:59,040
yourself and how you got into gardening

105
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,239
yeah so I got into growing um pretty

106
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,000
early on I was super interested in

107
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:07,519
Plants I got to watch my dad grow and I

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,479
got to uh get my clause in in an early

109
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,920
understanding of this plant and its

110
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,679
medicinal benefits um that are still

111
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,959
being researched on today and I even

112
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,439
wrote a research paper in Middle School

113
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,399
one of the few A's I got in school thank

114
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:25,800
you very much um of why it should be

115
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,638
legalized and it was a uh persuasive

116
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,038
essay that I feel like I did really well

117
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,000
on and the teacher must have concurred

118
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:34,800
and then all that snowballed through my

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,240
teenage years through an interest and

120
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,840
and a passion and a fire and because of

121
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,478
my stubborn personality and just my

122
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:46,000
grasp on this plant it it doesn't look

123
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:49,599
like I'm going to let it go anytime soon

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,319
and it's just expanding into a an Ever

125
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,400
wondrous uh kind of passion and interest

126
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:58,159
and drive to do better not only in this

127
00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:00,159
aspect but also branching into gardening

128
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,000
other things and in different ways being

129
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,039
able to feed my family and the community

130
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,800
so it's just been a beautiful Journey um

131
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,759
all along and I'm trying to uh spread

132
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,639
the message as much as I can that anyone

133
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,400
can do um these things no matter what

134
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,038
you have going on so I I think this is

135
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,879
going to be something very important to

136
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,560
tackle uh when you're dealing with

137
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,759
something that's super limited and you

138
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,360
can't grow as much as you might want to

139
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,038
um how to find what you might need

140
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,479
awesome and I know now you're at the

141
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:31,759
point where you

142
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,478
well actually been doing it for several

143
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,280
years which is YouTube so you have a

144
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,879
YouTube channel believe you have some

145
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:41,559
other social media as well what kind of

146
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,439
got you into YouTube in this uh

147
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,240
Community okay so I I've been into

148
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:49,000
YouTube for a long time I've been into

149
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,478
content creation for a long time um a

150
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,478
YouTuber uh that I took very early

151
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:56,478
inspiration on actually is Joe sanado

152
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,279
and he is a YouTuber from New York who

153
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:59,639
made super entertaining content that I

154
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:03,239
found really appealing as a team

155
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,639
teenager and um I got into the content

156
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,478
creation route very early on in my late

157
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:12,598
teen years and made a bunch of videos on

158
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:15,159
a channel and um I I have since deleted

159
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:17,199
everything on there but I I went from

160
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,360
content creation and then I got the

161
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,280
passion for gardening and I was like if

162
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,038
I just did content creation if I did

163
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:28,918
documentation around this plan I think I

164
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:30,439
might have something there and um I I

165
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:31,799
since

166
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:36,199
like listen to a lot of guys like

167
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:39,199
pigeons 420 uh a guy Mr Grow um who you

168
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:41,360
guys know and uh I I got into a lot of

169
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,800
these guys and even Mr Canuck grow but a

170
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,639
lot of them were a little bit deeper

171
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,919
into the science and I had to back off a

172
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,478
little bit learn the

173
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,000
nomenclature uh get the layman's terms

174
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,719
down and then I was like all right this

175
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,959
seems like something that isn't the most

176
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,919
complicated thing in the world because

177
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,079
getting early on in the growing I I

178
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:00,439
thought it was going to be like this

179
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,560
super specific scientific process I mean

180
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:05,199
watching my dad do synthetic nutrients I

181
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,839
was like he's putting these potions

182
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,319
together mixing everything into water he

183
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:12,478
knows everything to do and um I was very

184
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,879
early on in that process and then

185
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,800
basically since I popped my first beans

186
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,520
it's been history and I've just been

187
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,120
realizing it's a process that I was

188
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:26,279
going to be uh dialing in over decades

189
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,439
and it's not a easy thing to do by any

190
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,918
means well I I got to say your channel

191
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:33,360
is probably the mo one of the most

192
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:35,478
underrated channels in this community uh

193
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,120
and I know how much of a struggle can be

194
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:39,240
on YouTube in particular there's so much

195
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,759
suppression suppression going on jez I

196
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,519
can't can't speak today so I'll

197
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,919
definitely have links to his channel

198
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,399
down in the description section below

199
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,478
and I usually do a pinned comment as

200
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:50,038
well so click on his channel check out

201
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:52,120
his content and sub up to him yeah I

202
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:54,560
really appreciated the shout out on the

203
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,240
from the sash podcast uh and that you've

204
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,519
been calling my channel underrated it's

205
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,840
been um very flattering I know how hard

206
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,000
it is so the least I can do is kind of

207
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:04,918
mention some smaller channels and send

208
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,158
some traffic your way so all right so

209
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,799
let's get into your growth style first

210
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:10,279
then we'll get into fenal hunting so

211
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,560
what would you say your grow style is

212
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:15,918
are you indoor grower Outdoors are you

213
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,199
in soil Coco Hydro synthetic organic

214
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,240
what's your style yeah so I've I've

215
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:23,879
grown in many styles but I'll just go

216
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,639
over my primary style um it's indoor

217
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,599
synthetic growing in peep Moss is the

218
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,399
way I normally like to go it's how I

219
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:35,399
started it's what I know the best and

220
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,839
it's what I've gotten great results

221
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,559
repeatedly over time with which is

222
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:44,159
something that I'm really looking for

223
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,239
and I plan on experimenting with every

224
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,720
single grow style um just trying to get

225
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,519
it under my belt seeing if I can do it

226
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,278
seeing if I like it more than what I'm

227
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:57,399
doing now but um with the grow I have

228
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:59,399
right at this moment I have Happy Frog

229
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,639
soil which has been completely depleted

230
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:05,559
completed of its nutrients I then

231
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:07,799
have reused from the outdoor season put

232
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:10,239
into indoor pots and they are currently

233
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:14,199
in 5 gallon pots flowering out and I

234
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,799
have them in week six um I don't know if

235
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,079
the stash blend technically makes my

236
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,639
grow Sanic uh because I know the from

237
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:25,958
the stash blend can be used with living

238
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:28,639
soil and organic mixes uh but right now

239
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:31,639
I'm using base flour nutrients from Remo

240
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,838
nutrients and I am using uh the stash

241
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:36,439
blend for all the additives and

242
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,959
everything nice nice yeah stash blend

243
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,760
whether or not it's organic is a common

244
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:43,719
question and you know we decided not to

245
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:45,120
go the omry certified route it's just

246
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,519
and a lot of companies these days aren't

247
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,679
going that route because there's so many

248
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,720
fees there are many many fees you got to

249
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:53,199
register in each state and all that goes

250
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,839
above my head but from what I was told

251
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,200
by higher ups and people know that's

252
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,200
what's going on they said it's just

253
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,440
simply not worth it to go for that omry

254
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,079
certification but the formulation chem

255
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:07,720
says in his eyes it's organic so we're

256
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:10,679
just gonna go by that I I don't really

257
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,278
uh respect certifications personally um

258
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:15,000
as much as I respect the process and if

259
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,078
we can get down there and find the

260
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,200
scientist word on it I'll I'll just take

261
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:21,759
that that's perfectly fine all right

262
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,079
cool so pheno hunting we've got a lot of

263
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,759
new Growers that don't even know what

264
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:28,519
that is can you break it down for us

265
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:30,879
what is feno hunting 100% so for anyone

266
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,560
who has no idea there's actually two

267
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:36,159
steps you're going to be taking to

268
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,559
actually get to get to feno hunting um

269
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,719
and what you're going to want to do is

270
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:42,278
you're going to want to find a Geno uh

271
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,600
that fits what you are looking for in a

272
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:49,120
plant and a genino is basically just the

273
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,079
the specific cultivar you're looking for

274
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,959
and then when you get down to pheno

275
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:56,120
hunting you're going to get a few seeds

276
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,919
of that you're going to pop them all and

277
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,879
then you're going to find the different

278
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,879
Expressions uh from that specific

279
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:07,360
cultivar and that is going to be your

280
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:09,759
pheno hunting whether you're popping uh

281
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,278
five seeds 12 seeds or 100 seeds which

282
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,759
we'll get into later um it technically

283
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:17,720
is pheno hunting if you are actively and

284
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:20,639
consciously looking for the different

285
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,320
characteristics within a cultivar and

286
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,879
that's a very important distinction when

287
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,360
you're looking for uh turpine ratios

288
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:30,159
cannaboid looking for that ratio and

289
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,120
then looking for if you're looking for

290
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:36,799
colors sents tastes grow structure uh to

291
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,440
fit your environment um those are all

292
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,838
things that are going to fit into the

293
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:44,399
pheno hunting category so do you pheno

294
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:47,440
hunt male plants female plants or both

295
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,919
so up to this point I have been only

296
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,399
pheno hunting female plants and looking

297
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,399
for the best characteristics I can find

298
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,440
from the packs of seeds I buy and

299
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:00,958
normally I'll buy uh packs of seeds from

300
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,680
3 to 10 seeds and I normally can get a

301
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,919
pretty good diversity of phenos within

302
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:08,319
that but coming up in the future I'm

303
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,360
actually going to be making my own

304
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,079
strain which is going to be exciting and

305
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,759
then I also think I'm going to be feno

306
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:17,278
hunting chill out OG which uh comes to

307
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:19,759
me from Mr Grow again thank you for your

308
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,679
generosity um I appreciate that a lot

309
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,198
and also I I'm don't know if this is

310
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,078
going to be a side note or edit it out

311
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:27,359
but I did want to ask you if it's okay

312
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,919
if I breed with that seed uh either to

313
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,039
make more chill out OG as long as I

314
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:34,479
don't take credit or try to sell it or

315
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:37,719
anything like that um or make crosses of

316
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,120
it potentially absolutely yeah any I

317
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,959
feel like anything that's kind of

318
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,519
released to the public as open source I

319
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,479
guess at that point right where anybody

320
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,159
can really do anything with it at least

321
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,720
that's kind of the way I see it I know

322
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:51,000
that people are kind of more protective

323
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,680
over it but uh but yeah go ahead and do

324
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,399
what you want with it yeah I wanted your

325
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,599
perspective because I I've been doing a

326
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,039
little bit of homework on it and

327
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,240
apparently some people are really

328
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,240
picking on what genetics or if you can

329
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,360
use their genetics so I figured I'd ask

330
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,039
you um I also asked P about permission

331
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,759
of reacting to a video and he has pretty

332
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:09,278
much the same perspective on that kind

333
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,399
of stuff that you do so I I really

334
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,078
appreciate that and I feel like it

335
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,198
supports the community a lot especially

336
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:18,519
if you're in a position where you can't

337
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:21,278
spend $50 to $100 on seeds every single

338
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,759
time you grow it it can be a bit much

339
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,879
yeah absolutely so I don't think you

340
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:30,559
mentioned what your plant Max count is

341
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:33,480
so growing recreationally in Michigan uh

342
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,479
my plant count as 12 uh so I have quite

343
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,399
a bit of a blessing uh when it comes to

344
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,560
the flexibility of being able to Du a

345
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:43,679
feno hunt um and it can get really

346
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,958
complicated when you get lower uh but if

347
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:49,159
I were to go the caregiver route which I

348
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:51,638
feel I think I would technically be

349
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:54,480
qualified to go into that route um I

350
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:58,120
would be able to have I believe it's up

351
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,440
to six or seven patients and the total

352
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,639
plant count I could get up to is like 75

353
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,120
I think so it can go pretty high because

354
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,720
you can get 12 plants per patient um but

355
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,320
simply working under the plant count of

356
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,199
12 there are ways I can work around that

357
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:17,839
and uh easily easily get more than

358
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:19,278
enough herb to last me a long time okay

359
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,320
yeah so that's pretty cool that's a lot

360
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:24,439
better than many of the states out there

361
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:27,079
so definitely consider yourself lucky oh

362
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,880
I do it's a blessing every single day so

363
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:30,719
getting back into fenal hunting you kind

364
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,120
of touch upon characteristics so there

365
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,639
are so many different characteristics

366
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,759
that you can look for when pheno hunting

367
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,639
what characteristics do you look

368
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:43,240
for uh so personally I look for a a very

369
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,680
pungent tpine profile I want to look for

370
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,560
the the smells the flavors and I also

371
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:52,479
want to look for a medicinal aspect uh

372
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:54,198
since I do have uh really high anxiety

373
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,079
um I've been teetering off the

374
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:58,278
depression a little bit but my my

375
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,638
chronic pain is where I feel like I I

376
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:02,240
get the most

377
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,519
uh grief uh so those things are

378
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,680
specifically what I'm going to be

379
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,679
targeting um to grow outdoors I would

380
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:11,799
have to feno hunt for something that

381
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:13,679
could deal with high heat and humidity

382
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:16,679
during the summer months and then be

383
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:19,638
able to chill out uh really hard during

384
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,879
the fall uh but that is becoming less

385
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:25,120
and less true within recent years it's

386
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:27,439
actually been super warm um for the fall

387
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,240
but that's kind of getting off to a

388
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,360
different direction a little bit but

389
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,240
basically finding something to either

390
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,079
fit my grow style uh indoors if I have

391
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,919
an environment that's already set up

392
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:41,078
which I don't um and just finding

393
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,278
something that's going to be able to

394
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:47,359
help me uh whether it's with my chronic

395
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:50,198
pain or being able to sleep at night um

396
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,360
but yeah I I look for basically

397
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:55,879
something that tastes good to me and and

398
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,560
is effective I don't look for anything

399
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:59,919
super specific when it comes to the grow

400
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:03,039
structure because personally I can grow

401
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:06,039
around anything and I can adjust uh what

402
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:08,240
I'm doing pretty well I feel like to fit

403
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:10,719
the plants needs and then find out if

404
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,680
it's something I want later got it yeah

405
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,040
there are a long list of things that you

406
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:17,078
can look for when it comes to the

407
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:19,439
characteristics right I actually have a

408
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:22,758
a short list here that I'll mention just

409
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,240
for FYI for the audience here so growth

410
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:27,639
structure plant height weight build

411
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,959
density and root structure hardiness you

412
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:32,000
can look to see the plants reaction to

413
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:34,000
temperatures dependence on water

414
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,600
resistance to molden pests overall

415
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,278
strength tarpine profile so what's the

416
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,480
aroma coming from each flower appearance

417
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:44,838
the buds color and structure tric Combs

418
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,278
either lanky with small heads or short

419
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:49,560
stock with fat heads and Peak maturity

420
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:52,159
how early the plant is ready for Harvest

421
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:53,559
so there are a list of characteristics

422
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:55,639
that you can potentially look for when

423
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:57,799
fenal hunting so fig I mentioned that

424
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,560
additional uh additional list there yeah

425
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:01,679
definitely that's actually one of my

426
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:04,240
least favorite questioning questions

427
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,879
just because I find it so threatening

428
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,720
that there are so many things that you

429
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,000
can go into that it's hard to give a

430
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,160
comprehensive talk on the different

431
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,838
characteristics you can look for but

432
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,079
basically find something that's

433
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:17,639
tolerable for your grow style uh will

434
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,399
grow well with your other plants if you

435
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,600
have them going or something you can

436
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,038
work around or is predictable stable

437
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:26,719
genetics are really going to help you

438
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:29,279
out here in that aspect and it's totally

439
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,960
personal preference right you as the

440
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,960
grower are the one actually determining

441
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,960
what you're looking for right so I know

442
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,640
a lot of people these days really focus

443
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,120
on bag appeal they want to see what the

444
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,480
plant looks like they don't really care

445
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:43,119
about the flavor and stuff you know what

446
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,000
I mean whether they be in the uh the

447
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,719
black or the the gray Market the free

448
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,839
market whatever you want to call it

449
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,558
right yeah and I mean plants that I've

450
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:54,798
grown have really great turfing profiles

451
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:57,158
and really great flavor and smell but in

452
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:59,400
my opinion also have really great uh bag

453
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,520
appeal I don't know what it it is these

454
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,360
people are doing where they have a

455
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:06,918
really beautiful plant and it's super

456
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:10,479
tromey looks like a um a holographic

457
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:14,480
image if you will and then you end up

458
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,640
using it and it's not super

459
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,240
great don't know what they're doing I

460
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,000
have a hunch it's dry and storage it

461
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,558
could be yeah I mean that's normally

462
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
what it comes down to a lot of people

463
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,119
aren't really going after those lower

464
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,759
temps when it comes to drying and and

465
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:32,359
storing really I mean a lot of people

466
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,279
are now going in wine fridges or even in

467
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:35,759
their regular refrigerator just above

468
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,279
freezing temperature in order to

469
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,919
preserve it for longer while other

470
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:42,079
people they're just letting it go in

471
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,360
their room temperature or even higher

472
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,359
than room temperature and unfortunately

473
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:48,519
tpin are just volatized off at that

474
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,879
point so I have a hunch a lot of this

475
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:52,400
stuff where people like oh this doesn't

476
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,919
have any flavor on it it's like well how

477
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,038
was it stored you know how long have you

478
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,880
actually had it for because you all the

479
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:00,200
flavor could be gone by now yeah 100% I

480
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,799
mean it doesn't really help my

481
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:06,360
perspective that when I harvest a plant

482
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:08,400
it'll go through like a 2 we uh curing

483
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:10,399
stage by the end of all of it and then

484
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,200
it'll be gone within 5 months so it

485
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,600
won't even get to uh the the optimal uh

486
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,720
curing range it doesn't get to that so I

487
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:21,879
could have some bias there and but at

488
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,038
the same time you see these things with

489
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,120
uh dispos where they're like oh it got

490
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:29,119
chopped like a week ago it's like well

491
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:31,000
then why is it in a package right now

492
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,399
how did it get through all this

493
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,038
testing but that's that's completely

494
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,320
different too it's just crazy processes

495
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:41,720
that I don't know the ins and outs of

496
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:45,038
yeah same so when you're planting seeds

497
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:47,038
how many do you plant for a pheno hunt

498
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:51,519
so if I'm going to go for a feno hunt

499
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:53,798
and I'm looking to specifically get a uh

500
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:58,759
keeper from the hunt I'm normally going

501
00:19:53,798 --> 00:20:02,599
to go five to 10 seeds and the reason I

502
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:04,960
do that is because I want at least three

503
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:06,279
uh to five different Expressions that

504
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,480
the plant is going to go through and

505
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:11,319
I've grown cultivars where I plant three

506
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,319
seeds every single one of them are

507
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:16,839
drastically different I and I've gone

508
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:19,079
and I've grown cultivars throughout the

509
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:21,079
years where I popped like seven seeds

510
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:24,480
but all of them are very close to the

511
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:25,918
same thing um so you're going to want to

512
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,640
uh when it comes to your own number

513
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,520
you're going to want to look at the

514
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,000
stability of the Gen and also the

515
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,798
reputability of the breeder uh and find

516
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,759
out what you're really getting and do as

517
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:39,960
much homework as you possibly can um but

518
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,599
yeah I'll go normally the 5 to 10 range

519
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,558
I I feel like that gives you a pretty

520
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,839
good web and I feel like um when I go

521
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:50,399
into breeding I'm definitely going to

522
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:52,279
have to pop like seven at the minimum uh

523
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,400
because then there's that 50/50 chance

524
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:56,158
that you're going to get male to female

525
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,600
uh so I'm going to want to almost

526
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,760
guarantee that I'm going to have

527
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,839
something that I want to read with and

528
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:06,319
if not cancel those ones out and I still

529
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:09,399
have to look into how to feno hunt for

530
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:12,319
an optimal mail plant and how I'm going

531
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,640
to integrate those and which way I'm

532
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,119
going to go with the crosses and that's

533
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,520
going to take a whole lot of homework on

534
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:19,719
its own but that's going to be later

535
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,319
down the road too yeah popping a 10 pack

536
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,880
I feel like is pretty common for hom

537
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:24,480
Growers a lot of people just start with

538
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,840
the 10 pack you know that's what they

539
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,159
get from the breeder and then just plant

540
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:31,599
them all now unfortunately a few cut the

541
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:34,679
regular ones I actually planted a 10

542
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:37,000
pack before and seven were male so I was

543
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:40,480
like well there goes that feno hunt I

544
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,720
guess man I mean I mean you could breed

545
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,278
around that and be like well I'm going

546
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,159
to breed these seeds and I'll just have

547
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:46,679
infinite things I can pheno hunt from

548
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:48,559
these genetics and find out what it can

549
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,960
really do but then that plant limit

550
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:52,399
comes back into play and you're like

551
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,278
well I can't plant all these 150 seeds I

552
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,480
got so I don't know if you play Elden

553
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:59,839
ring or not but I feel like popping 100

554
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,798
to 150 seeds that's basically playing

555
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,359
feno hunting on easy mode I mean you can

556
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:06,079
just pick out something and then be like

557
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:08,558
yeah this is it this is the one I wish I

558
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:09,798
wish I was' be so good F hunt with

559
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,158
hundreds of them that would be

560
00:22:09,798 --> 00:22:15,000
incredible but uh unfortunately that's

561
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,799
not legal for me right yeah me too man

562
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,720
me too okay so you've planted your seeds

563
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:22,359
what are you using for a medium

564
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:25,640
typically and then container size and

565
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:28,519
type yeah so I'll go into uh I I'll go

566
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,278
right from planting in a Solo Cup

567
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:32,599
letting that plant Sprout and then once

568
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:35,359
its roots get too big for that um and I

569
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:38,480
do that to avoid overwatering primarily

570
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:42,240
but also not to waste too much space on

571
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,720
a individual plant or too much material

572
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,000
um so it'll go from the Solo Cup right

573
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,600
into a 1gallon fabric pot and I'll use

574
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,119
fabric pots throughout the entire grow

575
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:54,278
uh as for the medium it'll normally be

576
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:57,959
Peete Moss unless I go with an organic

577
00:22:54,278 --> 00:23:01,558
mix but if I go with an organic mix it

578
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:04,400
normally was amended with Pete Moss so

579
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:06,158
Pete Moss primarily and that's just how

580
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,840
I've been doing it I feel like it has

581
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:13,200
good drainage um good ation and it's

582
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:16,038
just a solid uh grow medium overall and

583
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,960
then when I actually get into the flower

584
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:23,519
I'll normally increase my pot size

585
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:26,159
Whatever It Is by at least 3 to five

586
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:28,879
gallons because I want to give those

587
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,039
roots time to expand and if I'm really

588
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,039
worried about the growth rate it it will

589
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:36,319
be more but that's Pho specific that is

590
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:38,000
cultivar specific and you just kind of

591
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,119
got to know your plants and how often

592
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,319
you're transplanting at that point uh

593
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:43,918
because once you get into flower you're

594
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:46,038
going to have to stop that got it yeah

595
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,840
the larger container the easier it can

596
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:52,079
be generally speaking now I learned a

597
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:54,119
little tip from a breeder way back well

598
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:56,960
actually not too far back but Canadian

599
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:58,959
Leaf genetics shout out to him he was on

600
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,720
the podcast before he had mentioned that

601
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,480
he does it in 2 gallon containers and I

602
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,839
was like that's pretty interesting you

603
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,480
know two gallons that's kind of small

604
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:08,038
but he's keeping the plant small you

605
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,720
know cuz he's really just pheno hunting

606
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:12,400
and he's not really growing these plants

607
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,679
massive so he's uh basically putting

608
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,559
them in two gown containers and when I

609
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,120
tried it it actually worked out pretty

610
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:18,798
good for me you know I had them all

611
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,759
hooked up to Auto watering systems CU

612
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:22,639
that it becomes difficult because the

613
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,879
medium can dry out so quickly in two

614
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,720
gallons so adding an auto watering

615
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,360
system like blue mats for example it

616
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,399
makes things so much easier so I've had

617
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:34,398
a lot of success doing two gal you know

618
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:35,918
and I can fit more plants in a in that

619
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:38,199
grow space whatever grow space I'm using

620
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,240
whether it be a 4x4 4x8 or whatever now

621
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,480
I've done pheno hunts in three gallons 5

622
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,720
gallons and uh like I said just makes it

623
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,960
a little bit easier when it comes to

624
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:51,759
like watering and stuff and yeah um I

625
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,240
did a a lowkey um content creator night

626
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,720
and I was actually looking through all

627
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,640
these different channels and trying to

628
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,600
find smaller ones that maybe don't have

629
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,120
the appreciation or ones that are doing

630
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:04,119
something unique and there was this guy

631
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,000
who only grew like super small plants

632
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:07,119
and he

633
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,398
had I can't remember if he had them in

634
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,558
like a solo cup or like different small

635
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:13,759
containers but they were all basically

636
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:16,440
like directly into flower he was like

637
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:20,038
this is enough flower for me um I don't

638
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:23,240
grow I don't use that much and I only

639
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:25,000
need four plants that yield like a half

640
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,640
oun to an ounce and I'm like that's

641
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,960
really cool for you man and there's

642
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,320
another YouTuber that grow

643
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,480
exclusively in Pringle cans from what I

644
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:35,759
can tell uh so I don't know if you've

645
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,038
seen that or heard of him uh but then

646
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,798
there's also the Solo Cup challenge

647
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,319
that's going on right

648
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:44,558
now so there's some crazy stuff you can

649
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:46,439
do with smaller containers that's just

650
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:48,519
not something I do a lot and I wouldn't

651
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,960
necessarily be comfortable unless I

652
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:53,798
dialed in a um Auto watering system

653
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,360
around that oh absolutely you can

654
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:57,278
definitely do stuff with smaller

655
00:25:55,359 --> 00:26:00,000
containers really well shout out to Mr

656
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:02,079
bman I think he r a one gal you know I'm

657
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,839
trying to get him on the podcast here

658
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:05,918
but uh he does some he gets some amazing

659
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,398
results with those small containers I'm

660
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,240
just like how do you do it and he's got

661
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:11,678
these real tall plans too so I'm trying

662
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,679
to get him on the podcast eventually and

663
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,720
talk about that because you can do so

664
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,559
much in small containers and I think

665
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,679
it's generally frowned upon it's like oh

666
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:21,240
what is this guy doing real small scale

667
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,120
and stuff but it's like Different

668
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,919
Strokes for different folks like that

669
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:27,519
gentleman said that you had went to his

670
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:30,480
channel he's only growing for himself so

671
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,759
he only needs a half ound per container

672
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,519
good let him do his thing you know what

673
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,558
I mean if he's able to to do it and uh

674
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:38,480
that works for him you know hats off to

675
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:40,519
him but yeah there there's so many

676
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,720
different styles to grow this plant so

677
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:44,440
many different size of containers you

678
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,919
can use and ways to go about it so

679
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,399
that's what makes it so fun in my

680
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,399
opinion yeah and one more thing too that

681
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,479
uh actually goes along with that is that

682
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:54,479
there's

683
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,000
um actual limits to how much you can

684
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,880
have within your household and and some

685
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,398
states they limit it at 10 10 o and

686
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:06,640
you're like well if I can only have 10

687
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:08,599
oz I can't grow a plant that's 1 2 3 lb

688
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,840
like I'm I'm literally not allowed to do

689
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:11,519
that so that's something else that

690
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:14,038
people need to take into consideration

691
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,359
too especially when they're uh frowning

692
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:18,158
upon uh different Growers grow Styles

693
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:19,240
it's like not only are you wrong but

694
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,000
you're you're

695
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,000
wrong how about uh nutrients what do you

696
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,398
typically use for a

697
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,319
fertilizer uh so going into nutrients

698
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:34,918
I've basically grown from beginning to

699
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:39,359
end uh with Remo nutrients and uh I've

700
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:42,038
done Garden like uh the kitchen scraps

701
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:44,839
organic material just kind of amended

702
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:46,319
into our Pete Moss mix into a giant Pile

703
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:48,199
in the backyard and that would serve for

704
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:51,639
an outdoor soil and those are the two

705
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:54,038
routes that I've gone down so far and uh

706
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,799
I've only been doing this for four years

707
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:57,679
working on my fifth year so I haven't

708
00:27:55,798 --> 00:28:00,240
had a lot of time to experiment or

709
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,278
experiment well uh so I'm looking

710
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,839
forward to branching off again but it's

711
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:07,440
been synthetic indoor organic outdoor

712
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:09,278
and that's just kind of How It's been up

713
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,880
to this point all right and then

714
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:12,599
environment conditions what do you

715
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,760
typically aim for when it comes to like

716
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:19,119
temperature humidity CO2 are you into

717
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:22,640
that at all or what yeah so this time

718
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:24,879
this this grow cycle in my 6X two closet

719
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,278
I've actually been experimenting with a

720
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,440
exhale CO2 bag which I picked up and I I

721
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:32,558
actually noticed a higher growth rate

722
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,640
since putting it in there so that's been

723
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:37,200
good um but I haven't actually been able

724
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,720
to measure the levels on that at all um

725
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,240
as for temperature humidity I'm going

726
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,839
lower on the temperature since we're

727
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,440
hitting the late flow um but it's still

728
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,759
so hot in that room right now I think

729
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,480
I'm going to have to um take a seal off

730
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,278
keep it dark in this room because it's

731
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,720
getting like into the mid 70s when I

732
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:58,319
want it to be in the high to Mid 60s and

733
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,798
then humidity I kind of go middle the

734
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:05,079
road I had it at

735
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:06,798
75 um 70 to 75 in the veg stage and um I

736
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:10,480
haven't actually been able to measure it

737
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:11,839
because my my um my meter broke that

738
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,919
actually measures that I don't know if

739
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:16,398
the battery died or something like that

740
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,000
but I haven't noticed anything unhealthy

741
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,319
going on with the plants I just kind of

742
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,519
go middle of the road vanilla see how

743
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:25,720
the plants actually um react to the

744
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:28,759
environment uh that's textbook uh for

745
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,919
these plants and I'm actually dealing

746
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:32,919
with a little bit of toxicity when it

747
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:34,320
comes to the nutrient aspect of things

748
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:36,720
so I'm going to have to flush those

749
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:39,359
plants out a little bit and see how they

750
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,319
recover from that this lat and flower it

751
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:44,519
might be a little complex but

752
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:48,519
environment not experimenting too crazy

753
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:50,798
um I have two spider farmer SF 2000s

754
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:52,759
which that style I don't know if they

755
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:54,679
make anymore but that's a very solid

756
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:56,640
light for a small grow space and I've

757
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:58,759
got two of them dimmed all the way to

758
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,120
100% really cranking that light down on

759
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:02,038
them and they seem to be responding

760
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:04,278
really well yeah I was going to make my

761
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:06,119
next question is are there certain

762
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:07,960
lighting levels that you aim for when

763
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:09,239
fenal hunting some people will kind of

764
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,319
adjust the light they'll play with the

765
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,278
light whether they give increased amount

766
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:15,639
of power than normal or less than normal

767
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:16,960
just to kind of see how the plant reacts

768
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,240
are you messing with the light levels at

769
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,600
all or just kind of keeping consistent

770
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,960
yeah no I've been keeping it pretty

771
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:25,000
consistent um I'm trying to just stay in

772
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,960
the middle of the road between

773
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,599
stretching for light and then also

774
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,200
burning from too much light and I don't

775
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:33,918
have a par meter but that's something I

776
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,640
do want to experiment with in the future

777
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,120
when I have the budget to get something

778
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,679
like that because it can be kind of

779
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,239
pricey especially when you go for the

780
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:43,038
higher end ones that are going to give

781
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,599
you like the exact number uh really

782
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:47,558
quickly and just uh be able to do that

783
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:49,678
but I haven't been experimenting too

784
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:51,678
much with light I haven't been doing

785
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,080
anything super crazy to the plants I

786
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,320
just want to uh find an expression that

787
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:59,599
these plants are going to give me in a

788
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:01,558
decent enir and then from there if I

789
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:04,199
want to do a run where I'm like well it

790
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:06,000
could get maybe a little bit more of

791
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,679
this if I just change this about my

792
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,359
plants and one of those things I want to

793
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:13,320
uh experiment with in the future is

794
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:15,839
actually integrating extra ultraviolet

795
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:18,720
light to uh give the plants the

796
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:21,119
incentive to put on the Extra Protection

797
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,240
in the form of Tricom and see if I can

798
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:26,719
make a little bit more Tricom density

799
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:29,919
out of a genetic um and get more tpin

800
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,679
and more cannaboids and more just more

801
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:36,360
of everything and then go through an air

802
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:38,519
cure um and see what it comes out with

803
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:40,359
okay now how about plant training now

804
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:41,839
this is one thing that when you're fenal

805
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:43,278
hunting you got some people who just

806
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,918
want to let the plant grow naturally and

807
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:47,398
see how the plant reacts naturally and

808
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,559
then kind of make their selections from

809
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:50,918
there other people train the plant they

810
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:52,798
want to see how the plant reacts when

811
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:55,000
you're training it what way do you go

812
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:57,200
about it yeah so I actually have two

813
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,359
answers for this question um I will

814
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,919
train

815
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:04,158
uh a plant if I'm looking to get like a

816
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,240
lot of clones off of it and I want to

817
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,440
maximize the tops I'm looking to get the

818
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:13,399
best candidates I can possible um so for

819
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:16,320
a normal like looking for a feno doing

820
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:19,119
the popping I just want this cultivar

821
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:20,398
this feno right here um I will go

822
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:22,479
through the training because I want to

823
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,719
see how it's going to react to my grow

824
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,079
style and put up with the stresses that

825
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,639
I want to put forth because if it

826
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:30,759
doesn't put up with that and it's not

827
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:33,199
going to put out what I need it to uh

828
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:35,798
when push comes to shove I'm not going

829
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,278
to stress myself out with dealing with

830
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:39,319
the genetic that's not going to deal

831
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:42,000
with me uh because I feel like you need

832
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:45,278
a symbiotic relationship in every single

833
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,638
aspect of the grow um but when I'm going

834
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:49,759
into breeding and making my own genetic

835
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:53,798
I'm actually going to take the opposite

836
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:56,319
step in seeing how the plant interacts

837
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:59,200
with the environment and how it grows

838
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:02,519
naturally to get a general idea of what

839
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,558
I could do with that plant and I feel

840
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:06,519
like that's going to give me a deeper

841
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:09,558
layer of understanding once I get to

842
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:11,240
that point okay I like that and then as

843
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:13,200
far as stress there are so many

844
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,480
different ways you can stress the plants

845
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,240
out Precision stress is kind of what I'm

846
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:22,000
referring to whether it be the

847
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,240
temperature humidity drought stress um

848
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,759
nutrient stress are you doing any type

849
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,720
of stresses for the plant while you're

850
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:30,839
fenal hunting

851
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,278
so I'm not really doing anything special

852
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:35,000
um I did put a second light in there

853
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:36,679
doubling up the light giving it

854
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,398
something that it's not necessarily used

855
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:43,320
to um but when it comes to Precision

856
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:46,119
stress um I might experiment with with

857
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:48,960
drought stress or something like that or

858
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:50,599
I do a lot of low stress training um

859
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,159
that's something I like my plants to be

860
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:54,599
able to deal with at the very lease

861
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,559
being able to get your stems weak and

862
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:58,558
bent over so we can maximize your tops

863
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:00,599
um

864
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:02,720
as for high stress training I try to

865
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:05,038
avoid it as much as I possibly can but

866
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,240
stems break so sometimes it does get

867
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:10,559
integrated whether it's on accident um

868
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:13,239
but I don't do anything super special

869
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:15,480
when it comes to the stresses of the

870
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:17,598
plants other than it's going to have

871
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,719
light stress it's going to have wind

872
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,960
stress I mean these things just help the

873
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:24,239
plant out and they're already things

874
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,639
that you have going on in your garden so

875
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,358
as far as anything super special no but

876
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,480
there are those precision stresses I

877
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:32,799
feel like everyone kind of participates

878
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,159
in uh that do help the plant whether we

879
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,839
notice it or not got it you mentioned

880
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:40,440
the stems reminds me of the stem rub

881
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:42,078
technique where people you know

882
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,878
basically take the stem rub it and then

883
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,679
smell their fingers and try to get the

884
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:46,799
hint of the aroma see whether they like

885
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,280
it or not and they want to kind of

886
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,280
continue with that plant or not do you

887
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,839
do the stem rub technique at all if so

888
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,280
how do you typically go about it like

889
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:57,119
when are you doing it and such yeah so I

890
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,880
do do the stem rub technique and this

891
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:03,880
will nor nor um be most effective before

892
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,200
the flower stage after your SE your

893
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,880
plants have sexually matured uh so

894
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:10,519
they're showing those pre flowers you

895
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,079
got the hairs on them um they're getting

896
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:14,280
ready to put out what they're going to

897
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,160
put out genetically with their finishing

898
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,480
up um that's when you're going to get

899
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:21,960
the best picture from the stem rub in my

900
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,358
opinion um but I wouldn't take that to

901
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,440
heart um if it is something you like

902
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:27,960
obviously push it through uh but if

903
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,320
you're just getting a little little bit

904
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,639
of hint of something plus that

905
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,920
stereotypical uh you know a veg plant

906
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:37,639
smell that that um blanket smell that

907
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,320
you get from the plants you walk in and

908
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:41,960
you're like oh well someone's growing

909
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,160
here uh you know that's mostly what

910
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,079
you're going to get so I wouldn't take

911
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:47,960
that to heart too much but to get a

912
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,200
general idea of what you might be

913
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:54,039
dealing with um I would uh but just keep

914
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:56,118
in mind that the intensity is going to

915
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:57,719
change for every single profile so if

916
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:59,519
it's like oh it's nutty and there's like

917
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:01,799
a little bit of vanilla there the

918
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:04,280
vanilla might come out um just in the

919
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,480
flowers way more but at the end of the

920
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,519
day uh your plants produce tricomes from

921
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,240
the beginning all the way to the end of

922
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:15,079
their growth cycle um and there are

923
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:17,279
Turpin and flavonoids in those tricomes

924
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:19,599
no matter the density so you will get

925
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,079
something and it will represent your

926
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:26,440
plant's genetics but don't take that to

927
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:30,079
heart um because it can change or it

928
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,720
could be uh not as good as you think or

929
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,160
it could be way better than you think

930
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:36,559
but just use it as a general guide as to

931
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:38,358
what you're going to be looking for when

932
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:40,559
it comes to the flower stage that's a

933
00:36:38,358 --> 00:36:42,279
good call out there yeah I agree with

934
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:43,759
you on that one I've done the stem route

935
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,359
technique for as long as I've been

936
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,720
growing actually for 14 years really I

937
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:50,239
learned about it right off the bat and

938
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:51,559
uh I totally agree with you I've had

939
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:54,799
plants where I did the stem rough

940
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:56,920
technique smell my fingers got one set

941
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,160
of Aromas right flipped over a flower

942
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,960
and then things have changed so I

943
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:03,559
completely agree with you like I

944
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,240
wouldn't suggest wiping out plants

945
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:08,078
because of a stem rub and then seeing

946
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:09,559
like hey I'm not really getting what I'm

947
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,960
looking for off the stem rub all the

948
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:13,119
plants and veg so I'm going to kill it

949
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,199
off potentially it might be better to

950
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,200
let that plant get into flowering really

951
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,358
start to develop and then kind of

952
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:21,838
getting the smells directly from the

953
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:23,639
flowers itself yeah and I mean if you

954
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:26,279
really feel like you need to know

955
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:28,279
exactly what that plant's going to be um

956
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,359
I would say take clones and super early

957
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,000
veg just chop off a portion of that

958
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:34,960
plant um take a couple clones put them

959
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,440
through flower um obviously if you have

960
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,519
the slots to do so and then you will

961
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,838
actually get a real picture of what

962
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:43,960
you're looking for and then by that

963
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:46,719
point uh you'll be able to just

964
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:49,358
eliminate plants if you really want to

965
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,838
um but that's one route to go down make

966
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:53,400
sure you have the slots for it again

967
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:56,239
we're talking about plant limits um so

968
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,760
you can't ignore that but yeah that's

969
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:00,159
another tool you can use other than the

970
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,160
stem rub technique you can flower out a

971
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:04,279
clone and that'll tell you exactly

972
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:05,799
what's going on with that plan yeah

973
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,640
absolutely that's a good way to go about

974
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,079
it so I kind of mentioned killing off

975
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:11,639
plants I want to know when do you start

976
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,720
to kill off plants are you the type of

977
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:15,199
person that kind of kills off plants

978
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:16,719
throughout the vet stage you know some

979
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:17,960
people will see a stunned seedling and

980
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:19,480
they'll get rid of it other people will

981
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,199
let that plant continue to grow and

982
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,000
they'll let it grow all the way till the

983
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:24,519
end how do you go about it when do you

984
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,159
start to kill off

985
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:30,119
plants uh yeah so basically my process

986
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:32,199
for killing off plants is I will get all

987
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:33,599
the way to the end um to give you the

988
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:35,759
end picture and then we'll go into the

989
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,039
like little nitty-gritty I get all the

990
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:44,040
way to the end um when I take my first

991
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:47,039
hit from cured herb I know exactly what

992
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:50,279
plants I'm going to be keeping and from

993
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:52,279
the veg stage I take clones of every

994
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:56,160
single plant make sure that I have

995
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:58,839
enough room um take clones of them uh

996
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:02,838
make sure they're vegging well and then

997
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:05,599
from the point where I know they're done

998
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:08,279
they will be about week four or five of

999
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,119
flow or a veg excuse me and then I will

1000
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,839
be able to eliminate the ones I don't

1001
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:16,000
want and um if you need to narrow down

1002
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:19,679
your plant count to be able to fit your

1003
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,480
pheno hunt then just take the best and

1004
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:25,960
healthiest plants um clone them kill off

1005
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,119
the weak ones is what I would suggest

1006
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,880
and then let them flower

1007
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:33,039
uh but I a very stubborn grower so if I

1008
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,079
see a plant struggling and it's not

1009
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:38,119
doing as well as the others in the veg

1010
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:40,359
stage I assume that if I take care of it

1011
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:42,680
give it a little bit of love and care uh

1012
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:44,279
through my experience those plants are

1013
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:47,399
normally the ones that have put out the

1014
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,240
best herb and whether that's from

1015
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,599
um

1016
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:53,078
Evolution saying that the weaker plants

1017
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,920
need to have the better characteristics

1018
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:58,200
towards the end for whatever reason

1019
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:00,159
maybe to protect them from pests or

1020
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:03,199
um dealing with light stress to protect

1021
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:05,519
them from one variability that they can

1022
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:08,679
um it it is something that I have

1023
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:10,159
noticed um but yeah a lot of people

1024
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:12,639
don't have time for that so I would

1025
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:15,679
suggest just if you need to kill off the

1026
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:17,159
weak ones I personally don't as much um

1027
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,159
I've had to refrain from doing that in

1028
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:22,199
the past I have a buddy that goes that

1029
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:23,879
route he is from Massachusetts and I

1030
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:25,078
think his plan count is six if I

1031
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,519
remember correctly I think it's six per

1032
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:30,359
person and then 12 per household so if

1033
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:31,880
you have more than one adult in there

1034
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:34,199
you can do 12 but I think he's just

1035
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,880
running six and he's got to kill off the

1036
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:38,598
week kill off the week and then clone

1037
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,760
the good ones and then he continues on I

1038
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:42,880
have another buddy who will max out his

1039
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,400
plant count he's he's got 12 so he'll

1040
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,680
grow 12 and then he'll hunt through that

1041
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,200
but what he'll do is he'll let all the

1042
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:50,559
plants grow all the way till the end and

1043
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:52,759
then towards the very end of flowering

1044
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:54,759
and he'll basically cut as many clones

1045
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,880
as he can I think it's right before

1046
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,079
Harvest so the the Clones haven't rooted

1047
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,960
yet so he's still within that plant

1048
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:03,119
count right if if things haven't rooted

1049
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,880
yet but he's monster cropping it so he's

1050
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,720
bringing it back he's cloning the plant

1051
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,400
while it's in flower right at Harvest

1052
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:10,838
he's taken one of those lower branches

1053
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,039
and he leaves the lower branches

1054
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:14,799
actually for this particular reason a

1055
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:16,440
lot of people will cut those off right

1056
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,839
before flipping a flower or the

1057
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,159
beginning weeks of flower they'll cut

1058
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:20,599
off those lower branches not going to

1059
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:22,239
reach the top he leaves it because he

1060
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:23,838
wants to monster crop at the end of his

1061
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:25,279
cycle but thought that was kind of an

1062
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:26,440
interesting way to go about it when you

1063
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,400
have a plant count when you have that

1064
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,880
restriction be able to grow plants all

1065
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,240
the way to the end and then just Monster

1066
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,480
crop at the very end Harvest St with

1067
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:36,919
plants and then you've got your uh your

1068
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,039
clones that you've monster cropped and

1069
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,440
then you can continue on with those JS

1070
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:43,800
if you want yeah so I can definitely see

1071
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,880
that argument um especially when you are

1072
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,920
someone who does their due diligence you

1073
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,480
have a lot of research in the area uh

1074
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,880
you goo hunted really well and you can

1075
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,960
look at the fragrance that your plant is

1076
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:58,079
putting off and say oh it has this this

1077
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,880
that and the other TP and that's going

1078
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,000
to help me with these problems or this

1079
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,358
is going to do that for me um that is

1080
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,159
definitely something you can narrow down

1081
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:07,838
for sure at the end of flower um but I I

1082
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:09,838
do like to see how the plants make me

1083
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:11,719
feel before I make my final decision

1084
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:13,440
firsthand uh because I don't want to

1085
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:15,239
throw away something like I have in the

1086
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,119
past that I didn't think I was going to

1087
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:20,239
like but was actually really good for me

1088
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,880
uh so I just tried to avoid that mistake

1089
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:23,519
Now you kind of touched upon this next

1090
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,800
question I'm going to ask it more direct

1091
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:28,039
which is at what point do you select the

1092
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,559
keeper feno do you select just one or do

1093
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:31,079
you have multiple Keepers now I'm

1094
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:33,480
talking about the very very end you're

1095
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:35,920
ready to select and then get rid of the

1096
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,199
rest just keep this one and continue on

1097
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,680
with it in your garden what point do you

1098
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:43,919
do that yeah so again it's a complicated

1099
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:46,358
question but the the short answer is the

1100
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,039
very end of the Cure I get to two weeks

1101
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:52,239
to a month in I see how it is treating

1102
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:55,440
me I see how um some other people like

1103
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:59,558
that I consume with and decide at that

1104
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:02,440
point um when it comes to selecting

1105
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:04,880
Keepers uh I normally will end up with

1106
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,358
more than one but it's normally not more

1107
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,800
than to uh because again if you're

1108
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:11,119
dealing with a plant limit you can't

1109
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,800
just have this cultivar be like your

1110
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:18,838
whole thing right you need to um get a

1111
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:21,200
get a variation uh variety is King uh

1112
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:23,799
when it comes to that and being able to

1113
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:25,318
grow a large amount of herb that varies

1114
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,599
in different ways and excels in

1115
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:28,318
different areas I feel like that's going

1116
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:30,519
to help a lot of people so if you can

1117
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:33,119
fill up your slots with 12 different

1118
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:36,519
fenos that are fantastic in 12 different

1119
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,440
ways or six or four um it that's going

1120
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:40,960
to be the best scenario for you but then

1121
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,800
getting into um the breeding again which

1122
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,159
I I want to get into it's going to be a

1123
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:49,359
matter of finding which characteristics

1124
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:51,838
I want to see in my own genetic and then

1125
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:53,920
mixing those two together uh so that's

1126
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,119
going to be a lot more of a picky

1127
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,200
process and I'm going to be taking a lot

1128
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:00,119
more notes than just being like yep no I

1129
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:01,639
like that one and I'll deal with

1130
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:05,440
everything that comes with it like there

1131
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:08,519
was a G13 that I grew um and it was just

1132
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,838
the most lanky thing it was throwing

1133
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:14,039
random branches Every Which Way and it

1134
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:16,480
was super St Stout and short but not

1135
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:18,639
because it lacked veg growth it's

1136
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,318
because of where it was going and then

1137
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:25,838
once you got into flower it grew such

1138
00:44:21,318 --> 00:44:29,679
big dense buds uh that were uh Frosty

1139
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:32,558
full of flavor loved it and um it was

1140
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:35,598
just a lot to bear so I could see why

1141
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:38,519
someone would throw that one out um but

1142
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,079
overall it was one of the top 10 plants

1143
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:42,519
I ever grew when it came to final

1144
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,720
product and that's getting rid of

1145
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:45,719
something like that is something I'm

1146
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:49,399
trying to avoid kind of reminds me of my

1147
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:51,639
chill out OG which is naturally slower

1148
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,960
grower but it's you know I don't even

1149
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:55,759
know if I want to say a slower grower

1150
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,519
but it's like shorter structure it

1151
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,160
really it's within his genetic the

1152
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,759
mother is a Pakistan Valley which is

1153
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:05,118
100% indicia shorter structure real

1154
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,920
tight inner nodes and U typically it's

1155
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,720
the plant that is smaller than all the

1156
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,680
rest you know that were planted at the

1157
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:13,480
same time I should say but when flipping

1158
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:16,679
the flower you get that stretch and you

1159
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:18,880
get some really really good dense Frosty

1160
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:20,239
buds under the right grow conditions so

1161
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,800
yeah what you was just explaining it's

1162
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:23,959
like I can see people who there have

1163
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,119
been people that reached out to me like

1164
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,240
what what's wrong with this why is it

1165
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,358
growing so slow and stuff well it's in

1166
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:32,078
genetics just wait until flower and see

1167
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:33,920
how it develops from there because I I

1168
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:37,000
think you'll be happy with it and yeah

1169
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:41,680
100% um I have just a quick note I have

1170
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,719
two white widows in there and one I had

1171
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:45,838
and it it's in the middle which I tried

1172
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:49,039
to keep my my shorter ones in the middle

1173
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:51,078
so this one was really short and going

1174
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:55,159
into flower it was about the same size

1175
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:58,000
as my second one um a couple weeks in

1176
00:45:55,159 --> 00:46:00,358
this plant just shot right up I bent its

1177
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,400
arm down it's its main branch and it

1178
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:04,880
just kept on going up and up and up and

1179
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,800
I actually had to come in at like I

1180
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,880
think it was week four and just tuck it

1181
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,400
back to the side and really try not to

1182
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,280
break it and then the other one didn't

1183
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,960
even touch the second net did did not

1184
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,040
touch the second trellis so it's going

1185
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,960
to uh depend greatly um what your

1186
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:22,960
genetics are how it's going to interact

1187
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,079
in flower is way different than how it

1188
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,400
acts in in veg a lot of the time and

1189
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,480
there is a huge unpredictability there

1190
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,000
but again if you have stable genetics it

1191
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,838
might not be something you have to worry

1192
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,440
about if you can take the Breeders word

1193
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:39,799
on it um but yeah that was really crazy

1194
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,079
to see great points so I'm going to

1195
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:45,720
throw a hypothetical at you if you had a

1196
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:47,200
plant count of four instead of 12 I feel

1197
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:49,558
like a 12 we got a little little bit of

1198
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:52,679
a luxury there having a plant count of

1199
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:53,920
12 but you know Canada for example four

1200
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:56,558
they're they're stuck with a four as a

1201
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:00,318
plant count how would you go about fenal

1202
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:03,920
hunting with a plant count Max of four

1203
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:06,039
yeah so man again this is a nightmare of

1204
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,760
mine and it keeps me up at night uh just

1205
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:10,519
trying to Theory craft around how I'm

1206
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,040
going to work around that issue

1207
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:13,719
especially with the laws changing I

1208
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:17,599
think that's something everyone needs to

1209
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:21,759
be worried about is if the wrong people

1210
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:23,480
get the wrong idea of what we're doing a

1211
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,359
lot more people could be facing this

1212
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:30,039
problem and we could be back to none but

1213
00:47:26,358 --> 00:47:32,119
as for tackling for um what I would do

1214
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:35,239
personally going through the flower

1215
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:37,200
stage I would pick out what I like what

1216
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:40,118
is throwing out characteristics that I

1217
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:42,439
want to keep out of these four plants

1218
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:44,640
and if I'm having an issue with one or

1219
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,400
two of them that is an absolute deal

1220
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:49,000
breaker I'm automatically going to get

1221
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,039
rid of those two um I don't need to deal

1222
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,079
with those problems I only have four

1223
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:56,039
plants and then I'm down to two again

1224
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,760
and what you can do from that point is

1225
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:01,239
you can either super crop and take a

1226
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:03,559
bunch of small clones and uh rev them

1227
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:06,118
throw out the Clones um that aren't

1228
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:10,000
doing as well and keep the two that have

1229
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:13,240
rooted and are doing well or you could

1230
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,039
cut them at the end of their flower

1231
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:18,318
cycle and then go through the whole um

1232
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:20,800
drying process and all that stuff and on

1233
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:23,199
the side you actually kept some bud

1234
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,640
sites on those plants to then go through

1235
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:27,960
a reveg cycle and then you could either

1236
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:30,239
reveg those two plants and grow them out

1237
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:32,318
as their own again or you could take

1238
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:34,838
clones finish off your garden and

1239
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:37,719
basically start from the beginning of

1240
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:39,558
that grow keep those two fenos maybe

1241
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:40,959
finish those ones off get a good yield

1242
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:43,240
that's going to last you a while and

1243
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,079
then you can either move on to the to a

1244
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:48,358
different genotype or you can just keep

1245
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,798
on growing those two fenos whether

1246
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:53,719
they're the same cultivar or not I think

1247
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:55,000
that's a good way to go about it yeah I

1248
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:56,318
think that's the most straightforward

1249
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,679
way you can go about it because there's

1250
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:00,599
so many like different factors that come

1251
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:03,118
into growing and how the plant acts and

1252
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:05,359
what you can do with it um there are

1253
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,480
ways you can tackle this issue and I

1254
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:09,239
feel like that's one of them so as we

1255
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,519
get towards the end of the episode here

1256
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:13,959
was there any other tips that we didn't

1257
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:16,199
talk about in this episode for how to

1258
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,240
conduct a successful and efficient fenal

1259
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:20,199
hunt with a plant count restriction or

1260
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:22,279
do you have any advice for beginners

1261
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:25,000
maybe those folks that are just getting

1262
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:27,160
started fenal hunting yeah so when it

1263
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,838
comes to um that question actually

1264
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:31,639
keyword is efficient um you want to work

1265
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:33,960
as efficiently as possible Branch

1266
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:36,000
yourself out as much as possible and one

1267
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,559
thing we can actually take advantage of

1268
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,280
as Growers um especially if you have a

1269
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,160
healthy growing Community or growing

1270
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:45,400
friends around you is send your friends

1271
00:49:43,159 --> 00:49:48,239
either clones or seeds of what you're

1272
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,039
working with and have them grow them out

1273
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:52,118
and then you guys can actually work

1274
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:56,199
together multiplying your plant count

1275
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:58,920
from 4 to 8 or or 12 to 24 and getting a

1276
00:49:56,199 --> 00:50:02,558
bigger map of what you can actually look

1277
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:05,159
for in these genetics and then switching

1278
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,880
and Crossing accordingly to who likes

1279
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:10,118
what and who wants to keep who and then

1280
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,960
from there you can multiply it even more

1281
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:14,599
if you got eight gr grower buddies you

1282
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:16,798
can multiply that and it just it can be

1283
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:18,680
this big project that a lot of people

1284
00:50:16,798 --> 00:50:20,480
are involved in and there's a lot of

1285
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:22,960
trust and communication in that but it

1286
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,559
can also make really healthy bonds if

1287
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,960
you do it the right way and you have

1288
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:29,920
quality people around you um who aren't

1289
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:32,679
just out for themselves and then

1290
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:35,119
