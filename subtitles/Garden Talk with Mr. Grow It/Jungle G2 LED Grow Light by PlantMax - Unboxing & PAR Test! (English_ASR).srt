1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,809
what's up everybody feel that don't know

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:05,549
me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,279
you'll watch um extra channel here I

4
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,929
have the plant max jungle g2 LED grow

5
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:12,480
light they sent me over this girl light

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,339
specifically to do this unboxing in part

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,528
test video if this is your first time

8
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:18,210
watching one of my part test videos I do

9
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:20,189
these just to give you a general idea of

10
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,230
what the power output is it's not gonna

11
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,480
be exact I take measurements in grow

12
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,920
tents whichever reflective walls this

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,868
could increase the numbers that you see

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,699
on the par meter but knowing these

15
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:31,678
numbers should help determine what the

16
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,929
light distance should be from the grow

17
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,719
light to the top of a plants I use apple

18
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:40,140
gmq 500 par meter this meaning measures

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,420
from 389 nanometers to 692 nanometers

20
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,370
plus or minus 5 nanometers and the

21
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,739
measurements are in ppfd

22
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:49,619
okay after I unbox the unit there is

23
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:52,169
this ziplock bag that includes a power

24
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:55,250
cord these brackets to hang the light

25
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:59,730
this cord here is for daisy chaining a

26
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:01,350
24 volt adapter and the user manual okay

27
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:03,358
so I've been told that the coverage area

28
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,140
for this girl light is at least two foot

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,728
by four foot

30
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,769
however this girl light does not

31
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:09,629
physically fit in a 2 foot by 4 foot

32
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:11,849
grow tent so I placed this girl light in

33
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:13,560
a full foot by 4 foot row 10 which is

34
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:14,879
actually a pretty snug fit and when I

35
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,920
take the measurements I'll try to keep

36
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,539
my apart meter on one side of the tent

37
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,329
I'll be taking measurements at 3

38
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,820
different distances 12 inches away 18

39
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:25,650
inches away and 24 inches away before

40
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:27,508
taking measurements I plugged the scroll

41
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,030
light into my kilowatt meter and it

42
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,599
shows 245 watts being pulled from the

43
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,260
wall and it shows two amps alright let's

44
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:59,009
get into the measurements

45
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:59,010
