continue the conversation about plant

16
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:35,600
breeding in this episode but we narrowed

17
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:38,039
down the focus to creating feminized

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,480
seeds he also tells us several stories

19
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,479

16th 2022 two years ago man time flies

64
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:23,840
and I was sick at that time I was I was

65
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,319
had chest issues and had some breathing

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,519
and yeah so this one's going to be a lot

67
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,639
a bit more active bit more engaging than

68
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,800
the last I was Dam near my dad did the

69
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,958
last oh I remember that yeah listened to

70
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,480
listen back a couple days ago and I

71
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,080
remember that I was like oh man he

72
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,039
wasn't feeling good he still did it

73
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,599
still battle through it I wasn't feeling

74
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:45,239
good either and then we just we got it

75
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:46,799
done what we do man you know the love it

76
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,280
I would hate to go out in life and not

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,200
be able to do interviews and do the

78
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,560
things that you love to do so I if I was

79
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:56,359
a croak over at that second I've been

80
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,400
happy that went out like a soldier you

81
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,159
know but even if we weren't feeling 100%

82
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,800
still the episode did very well well it

83
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,519
got 46,000 views and we talked about a

84
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,519
whole bunch of different things in there

85
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,840
your story some of your breeding

86
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,840
techniques we got into today I want to

87
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,640
get a little bit deeper into things that

88
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,000
you do within breeding specifically

89
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,479
creating feminized seeds which is

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,120
something you do and you have a lot of

91
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,919
experience with so I think it's going to

92
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,319
bring a lot of value to the audience

93
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,639
because a lot of people like f so let's

94
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,679
get into it and and you're trying to be

95
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,479
you being super nosy but it's okay it's

96
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,959
all good I I'll share as much as I can

97
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:33,280
uh you know but it's all good yeah well

98
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:35,319
I know there's a couple different ways

99
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,000
you can do it which we'll get into it

100
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:39,359
first before we get too deep into it can

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,919
you introduce yourself for those that

102
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,080
didn't catch the first episode we did

103
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,399
together yeah for sure man I'm cardiac

104
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,080
crops and I've been growing since 1996

105
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,120
in the soil started outdoor uh went

106
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,879
horribly wrong came to indoor found that

107
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,879
it's a lot better because you can have

108
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:58,679
control but I've been growing you know

109
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:01,878
behind the scenes for many many years

110
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,680
and uh you know come 20 about 2018 is

111
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:06,598
when I went online but prior in 2012 I

112
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,920
had a delivery service I really got into

113
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:12,839
breeding U really heavy and um you know

114
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,878
started Native Sun genetics and was I

115
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,680
did not start the company to help people

116
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:19,599
at the time other than my flower because

117
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,079
I was in the streets you know it was

118
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,759
other than the flower I was really

119
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,680
geared to making genetics that would

120
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,319
work for me and and separate myself from

121
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,439
the crowd but it wasn't until 2018 when

122
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:34,240
I found found out that after I started

123
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,240
helping people online I saw you know I

124
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,879
saw an issue a lot of people had issues

125
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,079
with genetics either they were very

126
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,560
expensive which I can agree because you

127
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,120
know it takes a long time and a lot of

128
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,038
effort to create genetics but two is

129
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,959
that people were getting scammed there

130
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:50,000
was a lot of issues going on so the

131
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:52,519
people I was helping in my network which

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,279
is up to 24,000 people in my private

133
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:56,799
group on Facebook was you know they just

134
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,439
wanted good genetics and they wanted to

135
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,800
talk to the breeder and that was another

136
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:01,279
thing they didn't they didn't have

137
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,800
access to breeders you know you buy

138
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,359
seeds and then you'll never get to talk

139
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,800
to a breeder rarely happens so it was

140
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,038
really cool cuz I was able to offer that

141
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,879
and that's where I started free Hol it

142
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,079
Friday in my group which we do to this

143
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,680
day where I hook up people for with

144
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,399
seeds on Fridays and kind of do the go

145
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,680
along to help them out help people out

146
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,239
play little games and things of that

147
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,319
nature but it wasn't until 2018 and when

148
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,639
covid hit in 2020 that things really

149
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:28,680
took off because again this is what I

150
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:31,240
love to do I love to create and and and

151
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,000
you know breed and whatnot but it wasn't

152
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,639
until that time that I saw people needed

153
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,560
help and that's when I just decided to

154
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,519
offer some of my genetics to help out at

155
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,680
no cost so it wasn't like I came into

156
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:44,680
the game and just put price tags on

157
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,439
everything was like boom boom I mean my

158
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,720
network could tell you I I did it out of

159
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:51,160
love and out of passion and I just

160
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,160
enjoyed doing this um I was already

161
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,560
financially okay in life doing what I

162
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,960
was doing in life so it was just a fun

163
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,360
time for me to to take this on so you

164
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,478
know that's kind of where it started me

165
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,879
and then you know again helping people I

166
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:06,318
found you know when I started helping

167
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:07,918
people online I found the greatest joy

168
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,960
in watching someone struggle with

169
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:13,240
something I love to do and overcome

170
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,198
those struggles and grow their own herb

171
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,598
and

172
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:18,759
generate whether it's profits or whether

173
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:20,879
it's more more in our Network pounds

174
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:22,199
after pounds I have people who grow so

175
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,000
much herb now they don't they give it

176
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,879
away Christmas time they give it away to

177
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,918
their friends and so that that's a great

178
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:30,879
joy not only that they're passing on

179
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:33,399
what I've taught them to people so the

180
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:36,519
genetics keep us tied in the knowledge

181
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:39,038
keeps flowing and U it's it's it's just

182
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:40,839
been a a great thing to experience

183
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,360
because when you're authentic and you

184
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:44,198
know what you're talking about and you

185
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,919
enjoy this

186
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,000
realm hey this is what I this is what I

187
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:51,478
like come here to do this is my purpose

188
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,839
so that's a that's a bit about cardier

189
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:55,439
and ative Sun genetics and uh you know

190
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,679
we're here for the people man that's

191
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,439
awesome man yeah I'm a part of your

192
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,079
email list and geez it seems like you're

193
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,439
always hooking up your audience and you

194
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,719
got some really good prices on genetics

195
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:06,439
as well actually when this episode is

196
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,400
being posted it's a day after Black

197
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,639
Friday do you have any Black Friday

198
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,318
sales going on right now that the

199
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,918
audience should know about yeah

200
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,080
everybody loves our Black Friday sales

201
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:19,038
because again our genetics are already

202
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,800
so low people say how why how why even

203
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,560
some of my friends say you're crazy

204
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,918
because you're kind of jipping yourself

205
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,360
and I say well you know not really

206
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:29,799
because ultimately again I came in with

207
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,840
the notion to help people out so when

208
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,439
you come in like that and you know you

209
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,638
get 100,000 people hitting and talking

210
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:38,199
and this and that you know you could you

211
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,800
you're taking care of a lot of people so

212
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,639
you're not looking at the financial side

213
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,000
of things you're looking more at the

214
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,800
brand and more of the products that are

215
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,759
are moving in the Creations that are

216
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,840
moving so when with Black Friday coming

217
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:54,240
up you know we have something going on

218
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,000
and now that black Friday's here we have

219
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,840
our creation that's going on and I took

220
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,720
your chill out OG and uh I was able to

221
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:03,918
be blessed by you now I don't ever work

222
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,039
with other breeders I don't I've been

223
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,959
asked by many other breeders let's work

224
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:09,598
on projects together but I feel the

225
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:11,158
money is always the first thing that

226
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,240
they see they see large networks and

227
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:16,079
they want to work uh but the chill out

228
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,519
OG I saw something there I see how you

229
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,478
are passionate about the people you help

230
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:22,598
and almost we're on the same wavelength

231
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,598
in terms of the passion and wanting to

232
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:27,478
help folks so you know this year's drop

233
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:29,560
is going to be very special because it

234
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:31,639
has to do with someone that's passionate

235
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,320
like yourself and then someone like like

236
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,918
our team that's passionate about our

237
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,278
work and what we do so we have three of

238
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,439
my biggest hitters that have done very

239
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:42,278
well over the past seven years that's

240
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,080
the cardier cookie which is our our

241
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:46,360
strain that started everything our

242
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,920
Bugatti which was tested over the past

243
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:53,000
five years dropped on Halloween five

244
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:54,838
years ago and uh just took over our

245
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,799
Network and people absolutely love it

246
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,680
and a sour I'll tell you a bit more

247
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,159
about because it took forever it took

248
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:04,479
seven years to get this cut from an OG

249
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:09,439
who comes from La that is based in

250
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,920
Phoenix now um and he's a street legend

251
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,279
right now I'll tell you more about that

252
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,919
but that was so hard to get my hands on

253
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:19,120
because you're talking about OG Kush

254
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:21,479
from 1990 I think in the 80s ' 89 and

255
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,679
then a sour diesel that he worked on

256
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,200
from 92 until now and and and he's been

257
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:29,479
able to cross those to create a s Ro G

258
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,839
so you know I I just felt like yo I'm

259
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,320
going to bring some stuff to the table

260
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,839
to match with what you got going on and

261
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,120
and you know create some magic so that's

262
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,160
the drop that's happening now for Black

263
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,720
Friday and uh really excited about that

264
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,679
really excited I definitely want to get

265
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,480
deeper into those genetics later on in

266
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,159
this episode I'm really honored that you

267
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,639
actually kind of partnered up with me in

268
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:53,600
order to uh to do this and I definitely

269
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:56,000
want to also find out like what you saw

270
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,240
in the chill oo G that really sparked

271
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,559
your interest so we'll get into that

272
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,320
here in a minute the sale runs until

273
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:03,879
Cyber Monday I assume we go until Cyber

274
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,000
Monday but I kind of like to leave it

275
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:08,039
open because a lot of times folks you

276
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,480
know wives or husbands still want to buy

277
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:12,599
those stock stocking stuffers uh up

278
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,680
until Christmas so I leave it normally

279
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,560
what I do is leave everything open until

280
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:18,759
everyone takes everything and kind of

281
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,319
just honor that and then we close that

282
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:23,039
down and and uh that's that's the end of

283
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,360
that but I really try to damn near

284
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,120
giveway it's almost like a giveaway um

285
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,000
just out of saying hey appreciate you

286
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,480
guys for the year so it's worth checking

287
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,639
out it's worth taking advantage of and I

288
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,200
can guarantee that the the end result is

289
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,600
worth every bit of putting into your

290
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,879
garden awesome well if you can give me a

291
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,800
YouTube friendly link I'll definitely

292
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:48,159
toss that in the description section as

293
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:50,879
a pin comment as well yes sir we'll give

294
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,679
you a YouTube friendly link and people

295
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,320
go there oh all day man you know they

296
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,319
like to mess with us for some reason I

297
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,040
don't I really don't know why let's get

298
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,639
into breeding now one thing I remember

299
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,679
about our last conversation was you said

300
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:05,440
you started out pollen chucking and you

301
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,599
had felt well it seemed like you felt

302
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,480
like that was kind of a mistake first of

303
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,159
all what is pollen chucking and can you

304
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,560
kind of compare it to what you do now

305
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:18,759
which is selective breeding yeah so you

306
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:22,078
know uh breeding is very easy but being

307
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:24,200
a great breeder is very difficult so

308
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,679
what I mean by that is pollen chucking

309
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:30,200
is no more than growing you know you

310
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:32,519
grow 20 seeds and they photos and then

311
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,360
you get a male and a female and the male

312
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,560
pops up and the first thing that comes

313
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,720
to people's mind is oh I have pollen I

314
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,958
can pollinate these these ladies and I'm

315
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,120
going to have seeds and you're

316
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:45,679
absolutely correct um

317
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,600
but that's what we consider polu because

318
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,078
you never really got to find out about

319
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,959
the genetic you didn't you don't know

320
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:52,919
anything about the males uh you don't

321
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,879
know about the history of the line or

322
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:56,759
there's just so many unknowns you're

323
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,879
kind of you're kind of shooting an arrow

324
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:02,480
aiming at a Target in the dark and uh

325
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:05,439
when I did that in the beginning uh many

326
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,399
years ago it nothing was coming out

327
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,839
correct at all you know it wasn't coming

328
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:13,519
out right at all um so that leads a

329
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:16,639
breeder to what we call phenol hunting

330
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,679
and so phenol hunting is essential when

331
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,079
it comes to looking for the proper

332
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:23,759
genetics I mean it's it's

333
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:25,759
it's it and it takes skill to actually

334
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,120
pheno hunt when it comes to the rub when

335
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,919
it comes to the smell when it comes to

336
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,480
the end product it's funny CU sometimes

337
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,120
I don't even smoke you I don't have to

338
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,320
smoke the end product people say well

339
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,759
how are you able to because ultimately

340
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,360
when your senses are all there when you

341
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:40,319
smoke you kind of mess your senses up

342
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,120
right but sometimes during throughout of

343
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,720
breathing I did it with the chill out I

344
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,198
don't won't smoke for two or three

345
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,480
months so I can get the full essence of

346
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:50,639
the plant the rubs the smells and all

347
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,639
bring in all of the essence of that my

348
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,120
fingers don't have Bud smell on them and

349
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:59,440
I can really get a full vibe off of that

350
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,360
but what happens is you know when you

351
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,000
Chuck you're just throwing pollen on

352
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,680
there you're taking seeds now you would

353
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,799
literally have to pop 100,000 seeds to

354
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:11,000
find that one whereas if you understand

355
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:13,599
selective breeding you would say hey you

356
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,120
know what I have a a bad female right

357
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,440
here one that is superb and supreme now

358
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,320
I can take another Supreme clone and

359
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,760
another Supreme clone but then when it

360
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,320
comes to the males now that's what you

361
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,000
select and that's what you're going

362
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,560
after I've bought a mail before for

363
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
$1,000 which we'll talk about later but

364
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,000
I've bought a mail for a thousand people

365
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,919
thought I was insane but I understood

366
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,799
that you know breeding is you know is is

367
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:43,078
you know you take Lisa Leslie and and

368
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,879
and Shaquille O'Neal you're you're

369
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:48,399
probably gonna catch a seven-footer in

370
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:50,360
that Jean line seven out of 10 times and

371
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,879
so that's kind of what it is you know

372
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,360
just like dog breing you're not going to

373
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:57,360
take a a stud that is champion from all

374
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,240
across the country and then go around to

375
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,159
Roo's house around the corner who breed

376
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,198
pit bulls and he's got all kind of weird

377
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:05,600
pit bulls and just breed that dog you're

378
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:08,359
G to get a so so pit instead of breeding

379
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,120
with a woman across the country who has

380
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,240
a has has a a another champion that's

381
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,480
been you know labeled a champion in his

382
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,320
own right or her own right so blending

383
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,839
those two together nine times out of 10

384
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,560
you're going to get a very great

385
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,920
Offspring

386
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:27,638
so when you when you pollen Chuck you

387
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:29,439
are not creating the best genetics that

388
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,799
are out there and we see it all over we

389
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,199
see it a lot we see people there's so

390
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:34,879
many since the last time we talked

391
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,159
there's probably 100,000 seed banks that

392
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,519
popped up and how many of those are

393
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:40,879
pollen chucking and how many of those

394
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,320
are truly doing fenal hunts with large

395
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:46,198
facilities

396
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,000
and super rare I I I highly doubt it you

397
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:50,479
know uh

398
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,078
so that's that's my take on PA and

399
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,519
chucking man yeah and our last episode

400
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:56,879
we went into detail and like

401
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,240
characteristics you look for and males

402
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,639
and females we went over so much stuff

403
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,320
so at the end of this episode I'll

404
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,639
definitely link the previous episode we

405
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,519
did together so any viewers or listeners

406
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:11,198
that haven't tuned into that episode can

407
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,360
go to it after this one so femin seeds

408
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:15,159
are becoming more and more popular right

409
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,039
you had mentioned kind of pollen

410
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:18,360
chucking you take a male and a female

411
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,399
and you cross them and then you get

412
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,320
seeds out of that well that's going to

413
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,839
give you regular seeds right so those

414
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,720
seeds when you plant them some are going

415
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,959
to turn out to be males and some of them

416
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,800
going to turn out to be females now you

417
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:32,039
can create feminized seeds instead which

418
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:34,599
is a whole different process couple

419
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,198
common ways to do it are with STS

420
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,560
another way to do it was with collodial

421
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:40,879
silver I know some people use both of

422
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:43,000
those things in order to do it how do

423
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:46,958
you go about creating feminized seeds

424
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,360
you know great question man um you know

425
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,958
I went on when I first started the femin

426
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,039
siege run first I was against it

427
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:57,399
because let's start there because the

428
00:15:54,039 --> 00:16:00,120
truth is femin seeds you're stressing

429
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,879
the out of out of the plant you're

430
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,600
stressing her you're you're constantly

431
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,759
with the sprays and and whatever you do

432
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,839
there's a few ways to do it because you

433
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,639
could use a spray or you could use

434
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,079
stress so you could literally stress the

435
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,440
plant enough to where she her herodes

436
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:17,120
herself uh separate from the other plant

437
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,759
so if you have one female in there that

438
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,639
you want to you want to stress and and

439
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:23,360
flip uh you could do that in a separate

440
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:25,799
tent and just stress the heck out of

441
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,159
that female or you could do the spray

442
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:30,039
now I went

443
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:32,480
online I was so totally against it

444
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:34,759
because again I'm I like the natural

445
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,759
process and the the photos and and doing

446
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:39,079
this natural way but you know everybody

447
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:41,000
was yelling for fims and I wanted to

448
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:43,399
help help our Network out make it easier

449
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,600
for beginners so I go online I buy the

450
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,519
sprays the issues with a lot of the

451
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,519
sprays online which are good some are

452
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,519
good and some are bad some are not so

453
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,159
good is that you don't know how much

454
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,720
of silver nitrates in there you don't

455
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:56,759
know their recipe and they're not going

456
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,079
to they're not going to tell you the

457
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,560
recipe even if they place it on the

458
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,278
bottle they could be

459
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,439
so now you buy these products now you

460
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,359
spray and you follow the directions

461
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,640
sometimes it works and sometimes it

462
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,918
doesn't and so now you're kind of like

463
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,720
you know this spray didn't work I think

464
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,759
I invested a few few hundred dollars

465
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,919
into different sprays and it just didn't

466
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:19,038
work and so I kept studying doing

467
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,559
research and I found out that you could

468
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,519
really make your own spray and so that's

469
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:26,399
kind of where that's where I started so

470
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:30,160
I bought my own silver nitrate crystals

471
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,600
online and then the sodium uh sulfate

472
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,240
online which are the two the A and B so

473
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:39,038
anytime you see sprays out there they're

474
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:41,759
like mix a with mix with b um uh and so

475
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:43,919
I make my own a&amp; B now I've done a lot

476
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,440
of research a lot of experimenting you

477
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,280
can overdo it and stress the plant too

478
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,120
much to where she won't even flour so

479
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:53,279
I've seen people where they had the the

480
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:55,279
plant won't pollinate it'll have flowers

481
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,639
but it won't pollinate and that's

482
00:17:55,279 --> 00:18:00,079
because the spray may be off or that

483
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,720
genetic just doesn't want to work well

484
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:06,038
with with the the a BS and whatever the

485
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,480
case may be um or you could or you could

486
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:11,558
not do enough and she only has a few

487
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,079
flowers that that tend to set and again

488
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:16,519
may drop some pollen but not enough

489
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,960
pollen then the lighting has to be on

490
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:21,599
point and whatever else because that has

491
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,319
an effect on the the pollen and the

492
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:27,639
production as well

493
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:29,558
so when I started to make my own mix and

494
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,840
start to experiment on my own I started

495
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:35,639
to see much more success um then you get

496
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:38,678
into the world of S1 and then you you

497
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,759
would then get into the the uh the

498
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:44,038
crossing of others a lot of people don't

499
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:47,839
know that when you when you take a when

500
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:51,519
you reverse a female and she's reversed

501
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:53,759
and you pollinate another Offspring then

502
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,960
you still have to you don't have to but

503
00:18:53,759 --> 00:19:01,519
fenal hunting that new Offspring now if

504
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:04,440
she sex S1 is basically sexing herself

505
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:06,839
so when that when you when you flip that

506
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,000
when you flip her and you spray and she

507
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:12,158
starts dumping on herself and she sex

508
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,200
herself that's an S1 because she sexed

509
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:17,240
herself so you though that Offspring is

510
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,319
going to carry almost the similar

511
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,480
characteristics of the mom because it's

512
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:26,678
almost like a replica almost like a

513
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,880
clone uh but the problem with S1 is a

514
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:32,159
lot of times they are because it was was

515
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,080
stressed and it's a Herm a lot of times

516
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:37,080
you're going to find some hermh going on

517
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:39,599
uh with The Offspring can you phenol

518
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:42,720
hunt that out you can but again it still

519
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:45,599
carries that that genetic makeup where

520
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,079
it's it's so possible now does it Herm

521
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,000
the entire plant no what you'll see is

522
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:50,879
it'll Herm The Bottom some of the bottom

523
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,679
bottom Buds and you can pluck those off

524
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,200
and just continue to allow it to grow

525
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,200
and sometimes it affects and opens up a

526
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,640
few pollen sacks you get a few seeds or

527
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,480
whatever but for the most

528
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,520
that's why I never really wanted to do

529
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,240
films because I know what we're doing to

530
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:10,918
we're we're playing God and we're

531
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:13,038
creating it's like us trying to create a

532
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,960
you know take my cousin and create

533
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,480
another cousin just like that cousin

534
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,279
like you know say that's kind of what

535
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,279
we're doing so uh but when you go into

536
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:24,480
the another Offspring your chances of

537
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:26,440
hermaphodite kind of are they they go

538
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,880
down because then you're taking it and

539
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:32,038
it's not a self-pollinated it's using

540
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,240
the reverse pollination on another

541
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:37,158
Offspring another female so it gives you

542
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,038
a yray of of some Herms in there some

543
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:41,159
not some that aren't Herm that would

544
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:44,119
Herm and then from there you need to

545
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:48,159
fenal hunt that you need to fenal hunt

546
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:52,079
those Offspring Have to from there you

547
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:54,640
find a female that uh is stable and you

548
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,798
could then work that female to uh you

549
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,080
know to bring her to a a stability but

550
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:02,200
again to to to without cloning if we

551
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:05,839
find a female and you want to use that

552
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,240
female in and let's say uh for feminize

553
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:12,000
that that stable one you would didn't

554
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:14,440
have to S1 You' still have to S1 so uh

555
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,440
but using you know anybody out there

556
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,480
that's looking to do it you know and

557
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,360
really do some research because there's

558
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,759
tons of research online now you know you

559
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:25,599
can go anywhere online and and kind of

560
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:28,158
find uh information about creating your

561
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,199
own type of spray and I would say start

562
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,120
there and experiment and and kind of

563
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,759
come up with your own recipe because

564
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:36,759
ultimately what works for me is working

565
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:39,359
in my room my environment and my setup

566
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:40,640
but um you know are there sprays out

567
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,000
there that'll work yeah there's there's

568
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,320
sprays that'll work as well so to each

569
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,480
is to each his own you know I know some

570
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:49,439
of these sprays I actually got one of

571
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,120
the sprays before and it didn't work

572
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,919
right and one thing to keep in mind is

573
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:56,158
the shelf life so I actually got the

574
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,679
product and waited a year and then tried

575
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,200
to use it and it by then it just it's

576
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:02,440
not good I think if you get light on it

577
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,880
as well it kind of spoils it you got to

578
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,640
keep it in the fridge well I make my and

579
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,840
and I keep it in the fridge and it lasts

580
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,038
about 90 days um that's what well that's

581
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:14,119
what I've come to find out with my

582
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:16,558
sprays I don't let them go any longer

583
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:18,278
than 90 days and I I still think that's

584
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,918
long because I think I do like 60 days

585
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:21,440
and it's out so I I'll run through a

586
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,240
crop and then run through another and

587
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,880
then I'm already making another mix but

588
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,640
yeah like I said like I said you know

589
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,080
people got to understand we're in a

590
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,480
Market that is very hot even though it's

591
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:35,720
about seven years old it's still at it's

592
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,798
still peing so people are out there

593
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,720
trying to get it any way they can

594
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:44,119
they're making all types of crap and you

595
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,679
know making a profit and so if it works

596
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:46,918
or not damned if you do damned if you

597
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,600
don't but they made their profit and

598
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:51,600
they're off they're off getting someone

599
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:53,199
else's money so just got to do as much

600
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,000
research as you can and kind of figure

601
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,600
out your own recipe for sure and the

602
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,200
alternative to buying a product would be

603
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,678
to create your own like you mentioned

604
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,278
you've got the the two different things

605
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,600
that you created especially if you're

606
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:04,839
serious if you're if you're being

607
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,558
serious about this if you're just trying

608
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:07,678
to make money next month or two months

609
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:09,440
or three months and you're just trying

610
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,000
to make some money and trying to

611
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,480
hustle then then then you need to stop

612
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,159
because you're going to run into brick

613
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,079
walls you you end up you're going to end

614
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:20,240
up creating crap you know if you're in

615
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:21,759
it for the long haul then study you know

616
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,679
the more you learn the more you earn

617
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,720
study figure it out through through

618
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,038
knowledge and then experimenting and

619
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,759
trial and error and then then bring

620
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:31,640
something to to the market that the

621
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,319
people and yourself can enjoy because

622
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,759
then your name will you know kind of

623
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:38,960
ring a lot longer and so with the STS CC

624
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:41,839
me from WR so there's differences in how

625
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,360
often you should spray between STS and

626
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,839
then clodo silver the STS cck me from

627
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:49,079
wrong but it's once every four or five

628
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:51,720
days you spray and then the clodo silver

629
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:54,199
I believe is every day too right right

630
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,600
so the clodo silver yeah you you because

631
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,480
of the because of the the amount I

632
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:02,119
believe the STS that's why you would do

633
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,000
every 4 days um and and you know it's

634
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:06,918
it's a much higher uh concentrate you

635
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,919
could thin it out but it's much higher

636
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:13,278
whereas with codal silver um yeah you

637
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,320
can spray you know each day which that's

638
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,558
what I do for 14 days until the bud

639
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:21,038
starts to sit so I'll spray and spray uh

640
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:23,158
um they say spray at night time but you

641
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:25,519
know when you're lighting when you're

642
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:28,679
not rocking with 20,000 watts on one

643
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,558
plant I think you're okay to spray um

644
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,360
with lights on but you know I do

645
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,398
underneath and above and on the bud

646
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:36,959
sites and and after about two weeks

647
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:38,759
you'll start to see the bud set now STS

648
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,798
sprays I never had any I had never had

649
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:43,119
luck with those there wasn't there

650
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,000
wasn't much luck with STS sprays it was

651
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:48,839
like I said more of my silver nitrate

652
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,038
floal silver um and you know I buy the

653
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,839
crystals which you know then you know

654
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:55,919
you move around they they they dissolve

655
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:58,678
you're good to go I know some I have I

656
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,559
know people that take real nickels you

657
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:04,720
know a battery with some distilled water

658
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:07,960
and they kind of do that and that that

659
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,120
you're stripping the silver from that

660
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,200
nickel and that turns in but you don't

661
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:13,558
know the percentages you have to like I

662
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,319
said there's just there's so many ways

663
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:16,278
to skin a cat with when it comes to

664
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:19,079
creating

665
00:25:16,278 --> 00:25:20,960
FS um just got to find your recipe got

666
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:23,199
it and you kind of already answered the

667
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,519
my next question which is if you create

668
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,159
infomed seeds those offsprings are you

669
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,359
going to have more chances of Herm

670
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:31,440
treats in there and you kind of already

671
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:33,719
revealed that yes the answer is yes is

672
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,278
that correct it's a mandatory yes and

673
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,519
when people say oh these plants Herm

674
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:41,720
well no doubt if you really understood

675
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:44,679
how her how fims are made it's made from

676
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,159
her making a plant stress and in

677
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:50,519
hermaphodite itself and that's the

678
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,520
that's the that's the downside to fims

679
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:54,558
that's the only downside yeah we can get

680
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:56,918
into weight we can get into some other

681
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:58,918
things but that that to me that's the

682
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,480
ultimate downside is that if you're

683
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:01,759
going to run fims anybody that's out

684
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,480
there that's just getting involved in

685
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:07,000
this game and and saying hey I just got

686
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,919
away from Autos I'm jumping into fims

687
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,640
you you have to keep in mind that this

688
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,759
is one of the cons of

689
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,840
femin and you know you could blame the

690
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:17,759
breed or are you want to but as long as

691
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,759
you understand and you know the rules of

692
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:23,119
engagement you know you know you should

693
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:26,079
know what you're getting into um most

694
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:28,519
definitely so then should you avoid

695
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,000
breeding with femin seeds because of

696
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:32,480
that you know that's that's a give and

697
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
take because ultimately I've bred with

698
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,440
fims before and what I've seen actually

699
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,079
is my photo that's what this is why I

700
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,120
have the tester program this is why we

701
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:45,038
do so many different test of man I have

702
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:46,599
people in in Jamaica South Africa uh

703
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:48,240
Colombia and we're all testing different

704
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:50,278
environments and all this and that what

705
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,839
I what we found from the thousands of

706
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:55,398
people is

707
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:58,359
that you get a higher return on

708
00:26:55,398 --> 00:26:59,599
females when you use fim in a photo

709
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:02,798
across

710
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:04,599
it I found that I found that like you

711
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:07,639
still get

712
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:10,319
males but your you know you get more

713
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,880
females uh out of the batch so you've

714
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,519
created your mixture whether it be STS a

715
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,960
clodo silver and your spraying the

716
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:18,558
plants the frequency that it needs to

717
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,919
and the plant reverses right it's a

718
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,278
female and it reverses it starts

719
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,600
creating pollen sax and then starts to

720
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:28,519
release pollen shortly after at what

721
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:30,719
point do you pollinate a female plant in

722
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:32,278
order to obviously pollinate that and

723
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,640
then have that female create the seeds

724
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:36,880
if you're not doing the self pollination

725
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,679
okay so that's that's that's a good

726
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,200
question because you want to start

727
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:44,519
spraying a week before you start

728
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,640
breeding so and this is where I messed

729
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,278
up a lot in the past and anyone out

730
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,159
there that's trying to figure this out

731
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:53,440
this is this is a great tip is that you

732
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:55,799
don't want to put your female plant in

733
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,320
that tent and then all of your other

734
00:27:55,798 --> 00:28:00,879
females and start spraying and call that

735
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,359
one of flower you want to start spraying

736
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,399
your female plant a week before you do

737
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:08,918
the flip so you're still in veg what I

738
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:11,079
do is I grab my female and I kind of go

739
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:13,679
outside or you know take it out of the

740
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:16,319
tent or whatever and I'll spray that

741
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:19,919
plant um and then put it back in one

742
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:23,240
week prior to to

743
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,000
flipping so then when it's time to flip

744
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,679
yeah all the plants are in there we're

745
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,159
already going into flip mode and then uh

746
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,360
you know I continue to do my spray and

747
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,760
what this does is it gives the it gives

748
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:38,719
the female plant an opportunity to start

749
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,720
her start the start the confusion if you

750
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,120
will like oh man I got hit with this

751
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,159
spray what's going on you know I'm being

752
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:48,719
stressed out you know time for me to

753
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:52,080
convert and so by the time week one a

754
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,319
flower comes into play she's already

755
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:57,079
she's already you know I would say you

756
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,798
know mentally ready to convert to

757
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:00,678
hermaphodite

758
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,119
it's already there so now when when you

759
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:05,519
get to week one and week two of flower

760
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:08,398
and your buds are starting to set she's

761
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:11,278
now starting to produce the pollen at

762
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:13,038
which if you did it and let's say the

763
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:14,839
plant is in week three or four and the

764
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:17,398
buds already starting to set I noticed

765
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:19,439
that the the take from her to the to the

766
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:22,558
other plants they're not as it's not as

767
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,480
good it's it's just not as not as good

768
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:27,119
I'm I'm not sure why but I've tried it

769
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,759
numerous times and it just doesn't take

770
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:33,439
as well

771
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:35,278
um when you do the week prior to flower

772
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,399
okay yeah usually what I'm doing cuz I

773
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,240
do in breeding I have one cross which

774
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:43,479
you're well aware of you did and I um I

775
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,599
bet you I bet you it's a chill out

776
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,159
OG and I've had best luck around day 20

777
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:50,839
a flower you know that's when there's so

778
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,559
many different pistols uh showing and

779
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:56,319
once I hit that with the pollen man I

780
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:58,720
get a real good yield of seeds now after

781
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,079
it's pollinated you've got a obviously

782
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,880
grow the plant throughout the whole

783
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,960
flowering stage and then harvest the

784
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,519
plant are there any different growing

785
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,079
techniques for growing those pollinated

786
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:10,159
plants versus just regular plants that

787
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:12,158
you're going for a flower run like for

788
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,600
example I had a breeder on here before

789
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,120
he mentioned that for pollinated plants

790
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:18,918
he continues on the veg feeding

791
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,079
according to the nutrient chart for the

792
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:22,600
entire run he says that he swears that

793
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:24,798
he gets a better I don't know if it was

794
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:27,158
yield of seeds or more healthier seeds

795
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:29,319
but he he just stuck to the veg light uh

796
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:31,120
veg nutrient regimen for the whole grow

797
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:33,798
do you do anything like that whether it

798
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:36,678
be nutrients or lighting or environment

799
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:40,558
or anything I I you know what I I do

800
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:42,759
pull back on my nutrient feed um uh be

801
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:44,558
it that when you're trying to grow flour

802
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:46,119
that is supreme you're you're you're

803
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:48,960
adding your microbes you have your

804
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:50,759
enzymes jamming you're really dialed in

805
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,679
and you're tweaking things as you go and

806
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:55,879
you're really focused on uh the the

807
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:59,200
quality of the bud that is being

808
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:01,200
produced the cool part about is once you

809
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,679
once you once the pollen starts to hit

810
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,120
and those pistols you talking about

811
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:07,440
start turning brown then you know it

812
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:10,079
took meaning that you know when she's in

813
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,080
her 28 30 day of flower and you start

814
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,638
seeing those brown tips start to start

815
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:17,278
to do little curl and get brown the

816
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:19,879
sperm hit that ass you know she's

817
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:22,480
knocked up baby you know so like you

818
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,360
know it worked and from that point on I

819
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,200
just make sure she's nourished I don't I

820
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:30,038
don't I follow my same regimen as if I

821
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,720
was flowering but I pull back so I don't

822
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:34,960
need to invest into tons of microbes

823
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,480
tons of enzymes they do I still offer

824
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,240
that to the plant of course but I kind

825
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,240
of pull back and what I also do is I I

826
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,079
stress the plant a little bit now what

827
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,440
I'm not stressed like it's going to hm

828
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:50,319
itself but I stress her in terms of

829
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,360
allowing her to pull nutrient up and

830
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,359
pull the food up because if I just make

831
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:56,359
her lazy then what I notice is those

832
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:59,199
seeds the development of the seeds don't

833
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:01,839
start to form as fast as I want them to

834
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,319
uh meaning they they're they're not uh

835
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:06,558
it's hard to explain they're just not

836
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:09,359
forming but when when I pull back on the

837
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:11,079
nutrient and I make the plant say

838
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,079
where's the food and start searching

839
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:15,839
throughout the media the plant starts

840
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:17,879
uptaking much more nutrient and then I

841
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,879
start seeing the the the the food

842
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,240
actually goes to the seed because

843
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,799
remember you know it's all about the

844
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,079
seeds at this point not the flow and the

845
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:29,119
flower is still budding I mean you still

846
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:31,240
get Bud you know you still get all this

847
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:34,119
and that but it's all about the baby in

848
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,759
the womb now just like a prenatal pill

849
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:38,918
if you know a woman taking a prenatal

850
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:42,319
pill is really targeting specific

851
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:44,200
nutrients within her body so that prenat

852
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:46,319
is specifically going for there so

853
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,240
that's when I still push my phosphorus I

854
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:49,918
still push my magnesium I'm still giving

855
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,200
this plant what it needs but I'm pulling

856
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,639
back because I want the plant to consume

857
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,558
and to pull those nutrients up without

858
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:59,278
being lazy and saying a this stuff is

859
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,918
everywhere I don't want to eat today I'm

860
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:04,558
I'm good on that note so it's it's just

861
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:05,919
my philosophy now when it comes to

862
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:09,558
trying different methods I've never

863
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,880
tried doing a veg all the way through um

864
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:14,240
um you know because the seed is still a

865
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,080
flower it's still flowering and it's

866
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,759
still producing and you know um I I'm

867
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:20,839
not sure there's much research out there

868
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:22,599
that that's you know says hey this is

869
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:24,720
the right way this is the wrong way cuz

870
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:27,359
we still I still produce a lot of seeds

871
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,798
from from uh the way we perform it but

872
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,119
I'm going to have give give it a try on

873
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:34,038
the whole veg you know on the veg run

874
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:37,119
but uh I really don't change much of

875
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:40,038
anything other than pulling back uh and

876
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:42,558
I like to use LED

877
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:45,038
lighting I've noticed that LED lighting

878
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:49,079
works better than HPS and

879
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:50,638
CMH um it's much more softer it's not as

880
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:53,599
harsh on the plant remember they're

881
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:55,959
already being stressed out so and and

882
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:59,519
and I say this in terms of the female we

883
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,639
are we are perming or we are you know

884
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,798
reversing uh I've noticed that there's

885
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:07,759
more pollen with LED lights uh than than

886
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:09,398
using CMH or HPS and only thing I can

887
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,398
think of is that it's you know it's a

888
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:14,759
it's a lot harsher there's much more

889
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:18,679
ppfd being being hit uh from a CMH or

890
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,560
HPS so I don't know seems to work that's

891
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:23,079
interesting and so after you've

892
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:25,279
pollinated it you're not actually just

893
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:27,399
going until the normal Harvest window

894
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,240
right you're kind of pushing it longer

895
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,519
than the normal Harvest window according

896
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:32,039
to the Breeders recommendation right cuz

897
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:34,440
it's not a regular flower run you're

898
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:37,800
actually your goal is the seeds to be

899
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:41,000
developed so I heard roughly 8 weeks

900
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:43,280
after pollinating is the earliest that

901
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,039
she should Harvest how long do you let

902
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,440
the plant go until you're actually

903
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,199
harvesting so that's that's that's cool

904
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,960
it's interesting question because

905
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:54,039
ultimately I've had stuff finished in

906
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,760
six weeks meaning the seeds now the bud

907
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:58,279
wasn't done and that's what I found

908
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,599
interesting was the bud wasn't done you

909
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,359
you Scope it out they're clear as day

910
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:05,880
but the seeds are dark so a lot of the

911
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:09,039
blueberry that the DJ Short that we

912
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:12,800
found and we we hunted and the

913
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:16,279
F6 since they finish in a uh in the

914
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,560
60-day the 75 day time frame we've

915
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,200
noticed that in six weeks these seeds

916
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:24,159
are already damn near developed and and

917
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:26,039
they're they're complete um but the bud

918
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:28,799
wasn't done you know it still needed

919
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:31,358
another week or so but uh you know maybe

920
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,720
even two weeks but that's that's on that

921
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:35,199
note now there are some that you need to

922
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:37,199
push like the cardiac cookie that we

923
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,559
worked on a chill out I actually had to

924
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:42,639
let it go a lot longer because it has a

925
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:45,559
lot of sativa traits in her so the the

926
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:47,239
seeds form where your chill out was done

927
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:49,440
two weeks

928
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:50,959
prior you see what I'm saying and I I

929
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,240
think that has to do with the Pakistani

930
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,960
that's in there because you know the

931
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:55,919
Pakistani is much more of an indicia

932
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,440
driven so you know it's going to finish

933
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,960
a lot sooner where Mas sativas more my

934
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:05,039
cookie is more sativa like 7030 so I

935
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,199
could see that happening uh but yeah it

936
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:08,679
really depends on the genetic and how

937
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:10,598
the genetic is going to perform that's

938
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:13,358
like saying again you go back to humans

939
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:15,720
or or animals that's that's like say you

940
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:17,358
know you take 10 women that are pregnant

941
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:19,000
you know not every single one of them is

942
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:20,358
going to go to that nine Monon marker

943
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,480
there's going to be some ladies that are

944
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:24,480
ready to pop out a month early some that

945
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,240
are you know you know just different

946
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,679
times so then you start factoring

947
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:30,358
nutrients and all this and that and

948
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:32,598
you're finish and there's so many

949
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:36,358
variables that that that take shape but

950
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:38,240
I seem to allow to I I watch the plant I

951
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:40,480
pay attention to what she's telling me

952
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:42,879
and I kind of nurture her until it's

953
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,519
time to give birth and then you you

954
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,599
could tell another thing I do is I kind

955
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:48,920
of um because the top and the bottom top

956
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,760
middle and bottom are all going to give

957
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,680
you a different look a lot of the top

958
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,040
buds are going to be a bit wider or a

959
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:55,799
bit they're not developed yet because

960
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:57,639
it's New Growth the middle is going to

961
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,640
show you exactly what's going on in the

962
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:00,400
bottom you're going to the bottom you're

963
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:02,799
going to get these dark seeds because

964
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,519
they're it's they've been done but so

965
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,880
what I do is I kind of pluck from the

966
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:09,119
top middle and I kind of see where

967
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,318
that's at and if I can take my fingers

968
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,800
and I could start to crush um you know

969
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:16,880
uh and it and it crushes and it's watery

970
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,599
then I know that the top piece still has

971
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,119
some time to go but in the middle if I

972
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:22,240
can push my fingers together like this

973
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:25,358
on the seed and I could feel some some

974
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:28,000
strength I know that we she's on she's

975
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:30,279
right there right the other trick is or

976
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,119
the tricky part is that sometimes the

977
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,400
seeds aren't

978
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:38,200
dark a lot of people don't talk about

979
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:40,639
the gray seeds I love gray seeds to me

980
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:42,559
gray seeds are they're the truth to me

981
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:45,480
and I've let them go 12 weeks and they

982
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:48,719
don't get dark they're a breed of their

983
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,719
own they're they're

984
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,559
aliens they don't get dark they're Grays

985
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:55,720
and but what I've come to find out is

986
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:57,679
that you're a lot more sativas and a lot

987
00:37:55,719 --> 00:38:00,078
more of the the silvers the silver for

988
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:02,480
hazes or the silvers you know they they

989
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:06,240
like my cardiac cookie you're going to

990
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,199
they're gray seeds and they're hard like

991
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,039
rock hard like you got to put a slit in

992
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:12,519
them and soak them in water for four

993
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:14,440
days to get them to even pop and they're

994
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:17,719
just extremely hard then you get some

995
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:21,000
that are just soft and and dark and real

996
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:22,719
easy to pop so um again to answer the

997
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,639
question you want to pay attention to

998
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:28,439
the plant and what the plant is saying

999
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:30,838
and kind of you know you'll be nosy in

1000
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,280
week eight seven eight nine and maybe

1001
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:34,920
even 10 to really determine and you'll

1002
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,359
pluck a seat out and you'll know it's

1003
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,920
finished you'll know you'll know okay we

1004
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:41,318
can hang got it yeah I think that's a

1005
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,838
misconception about the gray seed

1006
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:44,800
something that's not viable or it's

1007
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:46,159
unhealthy came from an unhealthy plant I

1008
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,119
mean that's just definitely a

1009
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:50,078
misconception there the best I've ever

1010
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:53,358
grown the best I've ever grown come from

1011
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,720
Gracie yeah and just to clarify on the

1012
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:56,920
uh talking about Pakistan Valley the

1013
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,959
flowering time for that is 45 to 55 days

1014
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,159
so it's a a faster one which is one of

1015
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,199
the things that really sparked my

1016
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:04,318
interest uh and one of the reasons why I

1017
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:06,199
like to use it for my breeding project

1018
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:07,719
was that it had that fast flowering

1019
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:09,838
that's something I tried to bring out in

1020
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:11,959
further Generations here now you made

1021
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:15,000
several crosses with the chilo G I have

1022
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:18,599
to ask why the chillo what did you see

1023
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,358
in it that you liked Okay cool so the

1024
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:23,160
Pakistani I wasn't too worried about

1025
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:25,159
because I I I I did like the fact that

1026
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:26,759
it flowered early I knew that okay

1027
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:28,440
whatever we we do with this it's going

1028
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,920
to bring the the flowering time down on

1029
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:34,119
my that cardier cookie um and I knew it

1030
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,079
would add a bit more size and a bit more

1031
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:40,880
indicia to that uh that's that's one

1032
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:43,359
thing I like but that wasn't why I chose

1033
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,400
inside you have your Tahoe OG which is

1034
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:49,480
one of my favorites one of my favorite

1035
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,440
Stingers you know out there from all the

1036
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,679
cultivars I've ever run uh another

1037
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,920
classic is you know peanut butter breath

1038
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:57,759
you know you start digging into the

1039
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,200
peanut butter breath and those are those

1040
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,760
are two Classics to me so when I was

1041
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:04,559
looking at the background of it I was

1042
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,800
like this is this is pretty cool that it

1043
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:10,078
has two of two flavors and two

1044
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,079
offsprings that I really enjoy and I

1045
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,200
already knew exactly what I could do

1046
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,359
with those considering I have a cookie

1047
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:20,358
already I have an OG already right

1048
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:22,279
that's that's our OG Supreme the Bugatti

1049
00:40:20,358 --> 00:40:24,318
is bananas because you know the

1050
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,680
Bugatti's got the the gorilla runs in

1051
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:28,559
there so it's got Gorilla Glue runs and

1052
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:30,279
then it's kid off off with biscotti so

1053
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,078
now we're talking gelato and all these

1054
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,359
different flavors it's already new that

1055
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:38,359
we would be able to bring what you have

1056
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:41,559
into play and I knew you were working on

1057
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:43,759
it and since it is an F3 that I captured

1058
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:45,239
I I I I knew that I would be able to

1059
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,920
find something out of that mix it would

1060
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:50,838
be easier to Target what I needed to

1061
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:53,280
find out of the C2 Cent so really I'm I

1062
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:55,880
I was in search for the Tahoe OG I would

1063
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,839
have to probably pop 10,000 seeds to

1064
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:01,400
find that one one that is truly Taho

1065
00:40:58,838 --> 00:41:03,880
gleaning uh I didn't get lucky on that

1066
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,920
but I was able to pull out the the

1067
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:09,800
Pakistani which is dominant in in in The

1068
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,639
Offspring but then also some of the

1069
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,760
Tahoe is in there but the the peanut

1070
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:16,719
butter really showed more with the fenos

1071
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,920
that I grabbed and that's fine because

1072
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:20,959
again uh you know it's going to it's

1073
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,240
going to blend well with the the cardier

1074
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,280
cookie going to complement that really

1075
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:27,479
well I was really looking to because I'm

1076
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,200
working on my OG line right now so have

1077
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,240
a lot of cookie work and so uh I want to

1078
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:35,000
take it back to the OG side so that's

1079
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:37,519
what I was really like geared up to to

1080
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,039
look for but you know I add some more

1081
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:43,199
cookie to to the line and because these

1082
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:47,159
will be f1s in the Sour OG we're going

1083
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:49,039
to find a lot of OG powerful genetics

1084
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:52,358
within that Sour OG I don't think we

1085
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:53,960
find it in the run the the the Bugatti

1086
00:41:52,358 --> 00:41:56,440
and I don't think we find it with the

1087
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,079
cookie side so that's what makes this

1088
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:01,318
project kind of cool cool is that we

1089
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,800
have three different uh varieties and

1090
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:04,960
they're really going to have three

1091
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,920
different flavors but be some of the

1092
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,119
best of the best sitting up there with

1093
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,159
with some of the best cultiv bars and

1094
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,800
I'll say it right now

1095
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:15,239
guaranteed guaranteed yeah I always like

1096
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,440
to hear about people have grown the

1097
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:19,000
chillo G or bread with the chillo G like

1098
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,720
what they like about it so it's really

1099
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,199
interesting to hear your uh your aspect

1100
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:25,279
on that one I want to get deeper in some

1101
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:26,879
of the cultivars that you created let's

1102
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,559
narrow it down to kind of the ones that

1103
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,440
youve work with and use the chill OG to

1104
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:34,599
cross with cardiac cookie the Bugatti

1105
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:37,358
and the Sour OG those are the three main

1106
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:39,119
ones let's start with cardier cookie

1107
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:42,598
tell us a story about it you know what's

1108
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:45,200
the taste smell effects how does it grow

1109
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:47,119
so on and so forth everybody brags about

1110
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,838
their children their children are the

1111
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,039
best right

1112
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:56,159
so I'm going to brag about my baby and

1113
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:57,960
for good reason because number one in

1114
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:00,159
the creation of the cardier cookie it

1115
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,639
put me on the couch because of financial

1116
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:05,759
with my wife and the what I did to get

1117
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:08,719
her to create it uh number two my

1118
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,559
friends and people thought I was crazy

1119
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,759
uh so how it all started was I had a

1120
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:14,400
delivery service and the delivery

1121
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,640
service was going well that's where Big

1122
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,838
Mike comes in with the sour because I

1123
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:21,440
was buying flower off my guy you know

1124
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:23,119
that was part of my my system you know I

1125
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,559
was growing my own seeds I had

1126
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,519
everything that you thought of on the

1127
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:29,240
market we kept things rolling our

1128
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:30,679
delivery service was doing very well but

1129
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,639
I was just like every other delivery

1130
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:33,679
service the only thing that was

1131
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:35,759
different was my personality character

1132
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:38,440
in our in our delivery people were just

1133
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,640
we were top-notch in that field so I

1134
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,119
knew that the only way for us to be

1135
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:44,719
separate and to be different from

1136
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,119
anybody was to create our own genetic

1137
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:48,279
and I knew it would take a while and I

1138
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:51,000
knew it would take money this was the

1139
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,000
time in the era of the cookie era 2012

1140
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,358
and you know you had burner out there

1141
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,559
and you had all these you know the

1142
00:43:54,358 --> 00:43:57,598
cookies really started to take flight

1143
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,359
well

1144
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:03,039
um fast forward to

1145
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:06,440
2015 during this time I'm still

1146
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:10,400
experimenting um I came across a guy

1147
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,480
online who won the 2015 C High Times cup

1148
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,559
for his

1149
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:16,760
concentrate and I'm not going to bring

1150
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:19,040
his name up and I'm not because the dude

1151
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:23,520
the dude is is something else you know

1152
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:25,079
he's not too liked in the community uh

1153
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,079
but what I enjoyed the most was that I

1154
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,400
knew what he had so it's almost again

1155
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:30,800
it's almost like breeding dogs and you

1156
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,639
know somebody that won this won a won a

1157
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,440
you know a champion has champion dogs

1158
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:37,318
and you're not trying to buy the dog

1159
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,039
from about their character you're trying

1160
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:40,400
to buy an offspring so you could do

1161
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,279
something with it and that's how I

1162
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,680
looked at this guy he was really jamming

1163
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,599
on the East Coast I'm sure a lot of

1164
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:46,799
people have heard of him but I said hey

1165
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,200
man I reached out to him and I was like

1166
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,599
hey man I I like what you got going on

1167
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:53,439
you know at this time I'm buying cuts

1168
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:54,680
for like $100 $150 and I asked him I

1169
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,720
said hey man would you be willing to

1170
00:44:54,679 --> 00:45:00,719
sell me a cut and you know he said said

1171
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:02,799
yeah one cut $2,000 I'm like man this

1172
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:05,480
dude is this dude smoking CRA I was like

1173
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,400
this dude smok I'll never give somebody

1174
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,960
you know that this was my mindset and so

1175
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,838
I kept talking to him and he's like bro

1176
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,838
you just don't know what he was like

1177
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:16,400
really pushing the fact that you know

1178
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:18,960
you don't know what you have once you

1179
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,480
get it and I'm like whatever man and I

1180
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,240
we talked about the background so he

1181
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,800
used the animal Cookie and then he used

1182
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:27,279
another Girl Scout cookie but again he

1183
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,880
had proof that he won a 2015 cut it's

1184
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,440
concentrate if there's proof in the

1185
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:34,480
pudding and it was ringing in at 31 to

1186
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:38,440
33% so I knew I had to have that and

1187
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:40,920
start with with that creation so we

1188
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:45,280
continued to talk he finally sold me a

1189
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:47,720
cut man Chris one cut for $1,000 he

1190
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,040
decided he said okay bro I'll give you

1191
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:52,598
three Cuts now now let me let me explain

1192
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:53,639
this he gave me three Cuts unrooted for

1193
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:57,318
a

1194
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:59,400
th000 and sent them to me unrooted for a

1195
00:45:57,318 --> 00:46:01,838
thousand you talking about shake them up

1196
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,440
roll them you know cuz if they want to

1197
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:06,519
root it he's not giving me a refund and

1198
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,679
if he didn't send them I would have you

1199
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:10,000
know so my friends were like man are you

1200
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:11,399
crazy bro you could have just went to

1201
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,800
Cali and all this and that and I was

1202
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,880
like no man I'm Gonna Roll the Dice on

1203
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,880
this roet

1204
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:22,280
so he ends up sending them so I go to

1205
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:24,440
Western Yun I send him the money uh and

1206
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,720
lo and behold they show up I immediately

1207
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,800
put them in and I start to grow them out

1208
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:30,838
now now I get a hold of a guy in Cali I

1209
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,839
had some connections in the Bay Area in

1210
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:34,440
Southern Cali you know I've been had

1211
00:46:32,838 --> 00:46:36,279
connects there so I reached out to my

1212
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,400
connect I said yo man I'm looking to to

1213
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:41,000
get some clones but some some top-notch

1214
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,760
clones uh my search guided me to a guy

1215
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,880
named cookie Dave he was known in the

1216
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:48,000
Bay Area a lot of people know new cookie

1217
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,000
Dave from the 2012 era and uh you know

1218
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,358
but cookie Dave he wasn't trying to give

1219
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,039
his females off and I thought this was a

1220
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:59,078
perfect time because like I'm down to

1221
00:46:56,039 --> 00:47:01,318
buy a male cut now who buys male male

1222
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:04,318
cuts but then I get hit with another

1223
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:06,558
thousand long story short and at this

1224
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:08,318
point my wife is like what are you doing

1225
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:10,200
what are you thinking of oh my goodness

1226
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:11,400
all this dead your delivery service is

1227
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:13,199
going great you don't need to make

1228
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,079
anything better and she just didn't

1229
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:17,519
understand that I was like because I

1230
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:19,440
used to breed dogs and we had champion

1231
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:22,119
dogs so I knew that the only way for us

1232
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,559
to become champions in this world and

1233
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:28,240
separate ourselves was to do this so I

1234
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:29,480
bought it man we argued bro I slept on

1235
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:32,598
the couch a few nights cuz I wasn't

1236
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:35,280
trying to hear it and uh the male plant

1237
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:38,519
came I grew the females out from what

1238
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:40,400
was sent to me from the female side uh

1239
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:42,719
things worked out really well I crossed

1240
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,358
those two I started to work on that line

1241
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:48,919
and I couldn't find anything for a while

1242
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:51,880
finally um we had a I think it was 2016

1243
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:53,838
or 17 we had the I I entered the Earl

1244
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,838
cup here in Phoenix and I don't ever

1245
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:57,719
enter cups I only entered the Earl cup

1246
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:59,639
because I didn't want want to send my

1247
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:01,199
stuff off to the labs to get tested and

1248
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:03,759
if you enter in the Earl cup you can go

1249
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:05,039
under an alias and put your stuff in

1250
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,559
there and they were going to run test

1251
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:08,960
for you so I think it's like 2016 17

1252
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:12,280
right around that area so that's the

1253
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:16,039
reason why I entered So I entered

1254
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:19,200
it and uh my offspring that I created

1255
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:23,119
came back at 31 317 or something like

1256
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:24,519
that with a 4% CBD and I was ecstatic

1257
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,039
because I didn't care about winning the

1258
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:27,639
cup I didn't care about any of that I

1259
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:29,880
just knew I was working on something and

1260
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:31,480
I carried the female line and I had the

1261
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,920
cookie from the male so I knew I had

1262
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:37,440
something very powerful very good and

1263
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:40,358
that's basically was the base and the

1264
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,800
starting point of my of my genetic line

1265
00:48:40,358 --> 00:48:45,960
I said I have some to this day it's what

1266
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:49,119
eight years later and I still have it's

1267
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:51,599
not the original but I still

1268
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:54,200
have the cut from the cut from the cut

1269
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:57,240
from the cut from the cut of the very

1270
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:58,719
first one that I that I produced um I

1271
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:00,679
even done some back Crossing where I

1272
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:02,838
kept the original went down the line and

1273
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:06,000
came back to keep her strong and it's

1274
00:49:02,838 --> 00:49:09,358
the reason why people say how did you

1275
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,280
get 79 cultivars well it's not truly 79

1276
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:15,558
cultivars what I'm doing is I'm working

1277
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:18,200
my line into other cultivars to keep

1278
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:21,160
that genetic I created strong because

1279
00:49:18,199 --> 00:49:23,318
then I go down and come back to some

1280
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:24,879
Originals so it's keeping that's why

1281
00:49:23,318 --> 00:49:27,480
when you grow the blue faces when you

1282
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:30,519
grow a lot of my work the antidote cook

1283
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,519
you see the original in there and it

1284
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:34,159
still holds the power because my goal in

1285
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:36,599
the beginning was to get power and

1286
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:38,000
flavor those are two difficult things to

1287
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,599
do when you're trying to create a

1288
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,079
genetic and I don't care who you are

1289
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,599
where you're at I've seen some top Elite

1290
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:49,720
flow and I'm like o o and then you're

1291
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:53,160
like o oh flavors there but man this is

1292
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:55,959
like smoking on a flavored cigarette

1293
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:58,118
electric cigarette or something so

1294
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,798
getting those two match is very

1295
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:02,280
difficult and that's what we were able

1296
00:49:59,798 --> 00:50:05,880
to do with the cardia cookie is is bring

1297
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:07,798
that now to now to to add to that so

1298
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,559
when it was done not only did we get it

1299
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:12,599
tested it did really well I was looking

1300
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,359
for the Earl Cup results the other day

1301
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:17,559
to so I could you know put more proof on

1302
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:19,639
it but when we did uh when we did the

1303
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:21,280
research on everybody that entered there

1304
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:23,318
was nobody even close the closest was

1305
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,760
like 25

1306
00:50:23,318 --> 00:50:28,440
26% right and I told Jim Morris who was

1307
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,160
the owner of the C I called him up I

1308
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,240
said man Jim there needs to be award for

1309
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:34,719
the highest THC content bro this is bu

1310
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:36,358
this is BS bro least you know D and he

1311
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:37,598
was like ah but the judges they go off

1312
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:40,078
flavor and all this and that I'm like

1313
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:43,119
it's cool y'all can have that but you

1314
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:45,798
know so I just I knew what I had so now

1315
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:49,599
now we now it's time to go take it from

1316
00:50:45,798 --> 00:50:52,280
the garden to the people

1317
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:55,440
bro I kid you

1318
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:58,599
not the the bud is so

1319
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:01,960
fire that when we ran out people would

1320
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:04,440
put down 250300 for before I even

1321
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:07,280
started the next crop for their for

1322
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:09,440
their Oz they were doing

1323
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:13,280
pre-orders for this

1324
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:16,639
flower no BS pre-orders I it was blowing

1325
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,920
us away because like you're already

1326
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:23,078
giving me money for a product that isn't

1327
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:25,480
even in the soil yet that's magic man so

1328
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:27,519
when I started the line I knew I had to

1329
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,760
to to come up with you know I had to

1330
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:33,639
start with that as my

1331
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:35,359
base now that created so many offsprings

1332
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:36,920
if you look at my website there anything

1333
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:39,358
that says cardier cookie we got the

1334
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:43,039
cardier cookie BX which is back cross to

1335
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:45,639
the original we got the bxf uh 33 which

1336
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:47,558
is the 33 offspring that with that's a

1337
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:49,039
bit bigger so but no matter what

1338
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:53,160
anything with the original card cookie

1339
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:56,599
in it Supreme hands down if you're a

1340
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:58,798
connoisseur you know what time it is so

1341
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:01,240
we got into the Bugatti the

1342
00:51:58,798 --> 00:52:03,920
Bugatti there's a cool story about that

1343
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:05,959
because um I really wasn't focused on

1344
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,559
the Bugatti like I'm not again I'm big

1345
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,079
in the flavor but you know I what I do

1346
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,519
like about the Bugatti is the gorilla

1347
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,318
glue and the runs that's in there the

1348
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:16,679
gorilla runs that I I created those two

1349
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:18,039
and you know made my own blend and then

1350
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:19,598
I brought it to the biscotti because

1351
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:21,440
everybody was talking about runs and

1352
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,640
biscotti at this time you know everybody

1353
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,679
the names sell and this and that so when

1354
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:28,639
I made that mix I I I I knew it was fire

1355
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:30,519
it's it's it's a great strain to have in

1356
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:32,960
your garden I knew it was fire I knew it

1357
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:36,480
was on point but there was a guy in my

1358
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:38,559
group his name was Cliff Hall and I

1359
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,960
helped Cliff out so much and he was part

1360
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:45,240
of my tester organ in tester club and he

1361
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,720
got the a pack of Bugatti he was some of

1362
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:50,078
the f one of the first people to run the

1363
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:51,318
Bugatti and he he ran the Bugatti and

1364
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,599
and before I go to there it's named

1365
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:56,558
Bugatti because it dropped on Halloween

1366
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:59,519
so Bo batti

1367
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:01,519
and so he's running the Bugatti and he

1368
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:04,119
finds some some some magic inside of now

1369
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:06,679
he didn't pop all 12 I gave 12 beans he

1370
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:08,720
popped six um he had some magic come out

1371
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:12,759
of there at this time he's training a

1372
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:14,239
guy in Colorado named Carlos J menz and

1373
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:16,640
he's trying to teach Carlos what I'm

1374
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:19,039
teaching him and he's relaying this

1375
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:20,400
information in this whole nine well long

1376
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:23,920
story

1377
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,680
short I didn't know Cliff had cancer and

1378
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,639
I didn't know yeah I knew he was a burn

1379
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:31,759
victim that that gave him a lot of

1380
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:33,679
issues with his health um but I didn't

1381
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,079
know he had cancer

1382
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:39,838
and Cliff passed

1383
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:42,839
away and you know that was touching

1384
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:44,960
because when I would talk to

1385
00:53:42,838 --> 00:53:47,279
Cliff I didn't know this man from a hole

1386
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:50,280
in the wall but he would tell me things

1387
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,760
like your grow hand is dope I've ran a

1388
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:55,040
lot of seeds in my past 45 years of

1389
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:58,000
growing and you produce some really

1390
00:53:55,039 --> 00:54:00,679
great flour and keep going young man and

1391
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,639
he just kept offering me these wise

1392
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:04,679
words and these great compliments and

1393
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,639
and I was not being humble at the time

1394
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:08,598
because I'm thinking oh you know you

1395
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:10,759
know I'm I know I'm making moves I know

1396
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:13,280
I'm doing good things but you know the

1397
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:15,799
words he was telling me didn't impact me

1398
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:18,040
until I knew that he was no longer here

1399
00:54:15,798 --> 00:54:19,759
and what he was basically saying is you

1400
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:22,000
know when you have a gift or when you

1401
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,119
enjoy something in passion in life you

1402
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,920
know rock with it and run with it and

1403
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:29,200
and make that part of Who You Are and

1404
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,480
that's all he was trying to relay to me

1405
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:33,598
and so the cool the story doesn't end

1406
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,400
there now he passes and remember he's

1407
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:38,000
teaching Carlos how to

1408
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:41,880
grow I find out through Carlos he

1409
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,599
reaches out to me because he says hey my

1410
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:47,358
friend Cliff who was in your network

1411
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:50,359
passed away I was like oh no I was like

1412
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:51,639
oh man he goes but before he passed he

1413
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:53,838
sent me some

1414
00:54:51,639 --> 00:54:55,960

1415
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:57,880

1416
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,199
stuff that I was working on and he goes

1417
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:03,000
he was he wanted me to take over his his

1418
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:04,118
seeds and grow them he goes I tried

1419
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,760

1420
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:08,920
Bugatti and I

1421
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:11,680
failed and I was like well what' you do

1422
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:13,400
wrong we went into the what went wrong

1423
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:14,759
he goes I'm not sure but I got three

1424
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,559
seeds

1425
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:19,160
left and I want to run these for Cliff

1426
00:55:17,559 --> 00:55:22,359
and I was like you know

1427
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:23,679
bro go ahead and pop those hopefully you

1428
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:26,519
find a female out of those because those

1429
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:28,558
were the original f1s and I said I want

1430
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:31,679
to help you through an entire

1431
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:34,319
crop no money no bro I just want to help

1432
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:35,639
you through an entire crop and he's like

1433
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:38,199
b b

1434
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:40,279
b so he finds a

1435
00:55:38,199 --> 00:55:43,558
female just out of luck finds this

1436
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:46,359
female and she's superb and we document

1437
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:49,480
the entire Journey so he starts to grow

1438
00:55:46,358 --> 00:55:51,960
it out gets his clones he does a tent

1439
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:55,039
and he blows it out the water bro and

1440
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:57,599
that was kind of like full circle

1441
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:59,079
because that was Cliff's home

1442
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,720
the young man wanted to learn how to

1443
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:04,318
grow he washes the herb and you know

1444
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:05,679
does his own washing and stuff like that

1445
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:07,679
but the young dude was able to grow the

1446
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:10,679
Bugatti that was handed to Cliff and

1447
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:12,679
it's just the full circle of of you know

1448
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:14,838
this relationship and Carlos and I are

1449
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:18,679
really great friends to this day he

1450
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:20,679
actually sent me the cut so the Bugatti

1451
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:23,358
that I got now is the cut that came from

1452
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:26,399
Cliff's pack and that's the Bugatti

1453
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:31,318
that's gone into the chill out OG

1454
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:33,400
see what I'm saying so Carlos ran that

1455
00:56:31,318 --> 00:56:35,199
and did one hell of a job with my

1456
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,960
assistance and from this day forward

1457
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:39,919
Carlos is yielding like four or five

1458
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:42,720
bows in a in a 4 by when he was doing

1459
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:46,119

1463
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:56,480
story of the Bugatti man and why it will

1464
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,679
always be part of our and every body in

1465
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,920
my group they know they knew Cliff

1466
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:00,358
because Cliff was loud he was in the

1467
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,880
group and oh yeah cardi ate this and

1468

dope and I don't need all that you know

1472
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,119
what I mean I'm just doing what I come

1473
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,440
here to do but people knew who Cliff was

1474
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:13,039
when he would always brag about me and

1475
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,358
say oh he's the best and all this and

1476
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:18,119

knows that he was running that Bugatti

1480
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:27,719
too so that's a story on the Bugatti man

1481
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:30,318
um when it comes to the sour like I said

1482
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:34,879
it took seven years to get it from Big

1483
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:38,920
Mike uh the Sour OG is sour diesel the

1484

1485
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:45,400
a OG Kush from the late 80s and this

1486
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:50,759
gentleman I'm speaking of is from La

1487
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:54,358
Watts LA and he's 71 years old so he's

1488
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:56,480
an OG he's not he's not your he's he's

1489

1490
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:02,358
to grow last year you know when we talk

1491
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:04,000
about pollen chucking and then so he

1492
00:58:02,358 --> 00:58:07,440
goes by the name of Big

1493
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:10,440
Mike uh many people knew you know 15 20

1494
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:13,480
years ago he was moving bows and you

1495
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:16,240
know there's industry and there's in the

1496
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:18,440
street I've I've majority of my career

1497
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:21,199
was in the street because that's how I

1498
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:23,798
started and that's how where I come from

1499
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:26,679
so when they went IND the street he

1500
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:29,038
didn't want any part of it he's like man

1506
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,239
from they get it from their source and

1507
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,920
that's just the way it's been going and

1508
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:46,598
that's who Big Mike was now he had this

1509
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:49,119
OG that was just just dumb good big

1510
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:50,559

1512
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:58,039

1551
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:27,440
you right now bro in the garden it's so

1552
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:29,000
hard when you show videos of people you

1553
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,119

1554
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,760
videos that's that's connected with the

1555
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:36,119
chill out and you touch it dog if if

1556
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:38,319
you're a true connoisseur and you

1557
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:40,440
remember the 80s and the 90s I didn't

1558
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:43,119
start smoking till 96 but if you

1559
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:46,400
remember in the 90s A lot of that OG

1560
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:49,079
that was moving around from east to west

1561
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:51,440
that's that that's that that's that

1562
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:53,318
original that's all the players all the

1563
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,559
hustlers all the Ballers that that that

1564
01:00:53,318 --> 01:00:57,440
Blaze from St Louis all my connects and

1565
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:59,559
everybody when you talk about an OG

1566
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,960
blowing OG that's him you know what I

1567
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:05,160
mean so that's one of the reasons why I

1568
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:08,079
wanted to bring it to the stage because

1569
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:11,159
number one you have a great stage what

1570
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:14,119
you're doing helping people and like I

1571
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:18,399
said on the same plane we're on in terms

1572
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:20,599
of helping folks knowledge bringing U uh

1573
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,280
great genetics to the table you know I

1574
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:26,119
found that this was a place this was a

1575
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:27,400
time to allow a hidden OG like big Mike

1576
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:28,920
to come out he don't want any

1577
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,960
recognition he don't want he don't want

1578
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:32,760
his face on YouTube he don't want to be

1579
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,838
he you know he just wants it to be known

1580
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:38,319
that yeah you know a Grower's Hand by

1581
01:01:34,838 --> 01:01:41,440
the name of Big Mike from our local area

1582
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:43,599
yeah he's let it be known so I said what

1583
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,838
better place to put it to and connect it

1584
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,160
with a man that's kind of got Network

1585
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:50,639
cracking and knows people all around the

1586
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:52,838
world unlike ourselves in the breeding

1587
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:55,519
area you know we have our Network in our

1588
01:01:52,838 --> 01:01:59,000
breeding Circle and uh that's kind of

1589
01:01:55,519 --> 01:02:00,838
why chose the the sour immediately chose

1590
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,119
the sour I was like this is perfect so

1591

the audience really wants to hear

1622
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:10,519
stories behind genetics because well

1623
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:12,960
often times you go to a website you look

1624
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:15,239
to uh purchase genetics and you see the

1625
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,199
name and you see a picture and that's it

1626
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:19,399
there's no background info so being able

1627
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:22,118
to Showcase that in a podcast episode
