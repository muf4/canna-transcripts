have a very extensive background really

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,200
focusing in on lighting which is what

74
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,280
we're going to get into today a variety

75
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,679
of topics when it comes to lighting but

76
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,640
first before we get too deep into the

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,159
things can you give us an introduction

78
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,399
tell us a little bit about yourself and

79
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:58,399
how you got into garding sure well my

80
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,000
name's Thomas Gibson I'm based out of

81
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,200
Vancouver Island British Columbia I I've

82
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,719
been doing this basically my whole life

83
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:10,039
my first outdoor medicinal crop was when

84
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:13,560
I was 13 um my first indoor was by the

85
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:15,719
time I was 16 um by the time I was 21 I

86
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,239
would have anywhere from 9 to 10 places

87
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,959
going for almost two decades where

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,799
there' be anywhere from 200 to 500

89
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,199
lights so I've really I've done this

90
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:26,640
just my whole life um I got into this

91
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:29,238
originally to make money and I came from

92
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,878
a very very poor background um but you

93
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,120
know develop the passion I love the

94
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,039
plant and I just love growing awesome

95
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,239
and what's your like overall style of

96
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,359
growing are you indoors mostly or

97
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:42,319
Outdoors as well are soil cocoa organic

98
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,439
synthetic what's your style um well for

99
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,919
majority of my commercial career would

100
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:49,438
have been promix with like a I would

101
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:50,759
actually add a lot of perite and um in

102
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:53,560
the beginning I think it would be more

103
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,199
Sanic for the first 10 years like what

104
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,598
with a lot of um I had a partner that

105
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,839
really liked using a lot of organic

106
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:00,598
amendments and then it was more u a

107
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,920
synthetic thing

108
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:05,119
um I've like I've dabbled with almost

109
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,000
everything like going back into 2001 I

110
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,438
can remember having Rockwell um playing

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,598
with that where we would have flood and

112
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:15,039
drain systems drip systems even uh even

113
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:18,358
an aeroponic setup so I've tried a lot

114
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:20,358
of different stuff um I right now these

115
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,319
days I just have a medical and I've been

116
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:25,879
experimenting with cocoa and it was

117
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:28,000
actually kind of a hard transition for

118
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:30,120
me just because like with soil the

119
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,639
dryback is so important in my opinion

120
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,680
and like if you try to water something

121
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,600
when it's oversaturated in soil you can

122
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,120
have a real negative effect versus in

123
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,840
Cocoa where it likes it and it can take

124
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,439
it and so I've been having fun just

125
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,799
playing with it and I like the the

126
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,680
automation side of things where it

127
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,000
doesn't require nearly as much time

128
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,319
there are so many different ways to grow

129
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,319
and I talk about in my content often

130
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:54,000
where it's it just makes it fun being

131
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:55,839
able to do things different ways me for

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,199
me personally you know if I was doing

133
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,159
the same thing over and over again I'd

134
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,280
go crazy so I personally I'm kind of

135
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,439
like you where i' I've experimented with

136
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:07,038
a bunch of different ways to do it and

137
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,839
uh yeah kind of narrow it in on uh well

138
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,719
these days I'm kind of narrowing in on

139
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:13,959
the organic all natural side of things

140
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,120
and soil but yeah I do still uh do have

141
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:18,318
synthetic grow here and there and I did

142
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,840
dwc recently for the first time been

143
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,919
growing for 14 years and grew dwc for

144
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,799
the first time just trying to keep

145
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,198
things fresh and it really just makes

146
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,720
things real fun absolutely well there's

147
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:29,919
like there's a hundred different ways to

148
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,240
get across the Finish Line it's like do

149
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,879
what's best for you I always tell people

150
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,199
it's like if you've got something that's

151
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:37,959
really working that well well then I

152
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,160
wouldn't really change it you know what

153
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:41,000
I mean if you're if you're getting those

154
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,520
results that you need just ignore

155
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,160
everybody else and just keep on going

156
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:46,879
straight forward with it I completely

157
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,600
agree with you all right let's dive into

158
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,918
lighting this is something that you have

159
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,879
a lot of knowledge on for many many

160
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:55,719
years I think we should kind of warp

161
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,478
back in time a little bit to begin and

162
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,240
before we get into the first topic which

163
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,959
is going to be the HPS to LED evolution

164
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,960
I just want to mention to the folks that

165
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:06,638
are tuning in on the podcast platforms

166
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:09,038
that there are visuals for this episode

167
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,280
so if you want to head on over to

168
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:13,719
YouTube just search Garden talk with Mr

169
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,478
Grow that channel will pop up and you'll

170
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,080
be able to tune in to this episode with

171
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:18,800
Grandmaster level and then see the

172
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:21,038
visuals that he's going to present to us

173
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,280
today so I'm going to give you the mic

174
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:23,279
and you know I know there's a couple

175
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:25,719
things that you want to talk about

176
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,359
regards to HPS versus LED so break it

177
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,919
down for us perfect let me just quickly

178
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,160
uh share my screen here so the first

179
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:36,959
thing that I'm showing here is a picture

180
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:39,160
of double-ended HPS spectrum and I would

181
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,359
ask people is or people a lot of people

182
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,720
think this isn't a unique spectrum and I

183
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,720
actually think it is actually very

184
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,039
unique what is unique about it well we

185
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,199
can see that there's

186
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:52,439
3.9 um 96% blue that's in the range

187
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,560
between 400 and 500 nanometer which is

188
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:57,680
very very rare if you're comparing to

189
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,879
any type of LED um the green is actually

190
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,879
pretty standard 33% is a normal number

191
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,759
anywhere between 30 and 40% so there

192
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:09,599
isn't really anything too special about

193
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:13,879
that next is the red and I I like to ask

194
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:16,000
this question is all red really red so

195
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:18,639
in a from a scientific standpoint from

196
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,038
people that are leading the world in R&amp;D

197
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,079
they're going to say yes it is from

198
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,680
someone that's got 20 years of

199
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:28,038
commercial cultivation I'm going to say

200
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,478
no and there is a big difference between

201
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:34,120
600 and 620 animer so you'll see um this

202
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,878
is the like if you look where the red

203
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,199
Peak is and when you think about HPS you

204
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,840
see like an amber color that kind of

205
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,919
comes off that isn't the same as the red

206
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:47,119
that the other type of red that's 660 NM

207
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:49,000
and so I think that that's one big thing

208
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,639
to point out that people have to take

209
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,038
into consideration and what I have seen

210
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,280
and I'm not saying that one is better

211
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,439
than the other that's not what I'm

212
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:58,279
saying I'm saying that it's a different

213
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:00,000
temperature light so to get the same

214
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:01,239
results

215
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
with a different temperature it's going

216
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,079
to be very hard now some do give you

217
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,720
almost some of the same results the next

218
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:11,399
thing about this light that is unique is

219
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,759
the amount of far red there's

220
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:17,000
10.48% most lights have under 2 or 1%

221
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,080
far red and most companies don't

222
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,279
actually even add far red diodes into

223
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,959
the light why uh far red diodes are the

224
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:27,918
most expensive and they hurt your

225
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,598
efficiency so it kind of um you're

226
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,319
you're adding a big cost and it's going

227
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:34,519
to hurt your efficacy number after LEDs

228
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,159
had been on the scenes for a few years

229
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:40,479
this is what it's kind of evolved into

230
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:41,918
and this is like a 38k spectrum and to

231
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,360
make this kind of spectrum there's lots

232
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,600
of different ways to make spectrums

233
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,600
first of all there are no spectrums that

234
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,040
are proprietary so if anybody says that

235
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,360
they've got a proprietary Spectrum

236
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,120
that's incorrect anybody can take any

237
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,639
light and SP uh stick it into an

238
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,879
integrated Spear and get a report and

239
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:01,278
that b shows the balance of blue red far

240
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:02,759
red green and you can match anything so

241
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,480
that's one thing to take into

242
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,278
consideration so this is what everything

243
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,680
kind of evolved into and I think it's a

244
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:12,679
pretty Rock Solid spectrum and it it

245
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,679
probably varied anywhere from 3800k to

246
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:16,359
3500k and people would usually make

247
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:19,679
these type of spectrums with using white

248
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:23,680
diodes usually a 1:1 ratio of like 3,000

249
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:25,799
and 5,000 Kelvin and adding 660 nmet and

250
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:29,359
they they didn't add 730 and there was

251
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:32,639
you know very you know very little um 7

252
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,360
30 in it so then after a few more years

253
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:38,439
went by this is what things have evolved

254
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,519
into and this is what I would consider a

255
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:46,200
heavy deep red 660 NM Spectrum what is

256
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:48,078
the big difference well you can see that

257
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,680
you've got this big massive red Spike

258
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:52,039
that is kind of dominating everything if

259
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,958
we just go back for a second and you can

260
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:57,480
just see about how much fer the other

261
00:09:53,958 --> 00:10:00,278
spectrum is and this is what things have

262
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,079
really evolved into and I think what

263
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:03,679
like what people are I would say

264
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:04,958
majority of the larger companies have

265
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,159
gone in this direction when they're

266
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:11,039
using single Channel lights and why are

267
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,838
they doing that in my opinion it's to

268
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,439
have a higher efficacy to be more

269
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,200
efficient when you add the 660 nmet

270
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,399
diode it's more efficient than any other

271
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,519
diode so it brings your numbers up and

272
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:25,278
it allows you to hit three micromoles

273
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,519
per Jewel um which is it's very easy to

274
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:27,838
hit if you're using a bunch of red

275
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,519
diodes but if you're trying to hit that

276
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,320
number with white diodes it's actually

277
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,120
very hard to hit and you have to use a

278
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:37,440
great number of diodes so basically

279
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,000
that's um what things have evolved into

280
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,600
so when we have people that are coming

281
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,919
from HPS to

282
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,519
LED um you can see that this is what

283
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:48,679
they're basically looking at and they're

284
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,159
like a lot of people come and they're

285
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:52,719
not getting the same results and they're

286
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:55,600
upset and they're saying oh LED is bunk

287
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,879
and this is and HPS produces so much

288
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,759
better and the real Gap is the

289
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:02,159
temperature of the light

290
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:06,039
now like if you look one of them's got

291
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,919
20% blue versus 4% blue and like which

292
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:10,240
on so many different um different

293
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:13,399
cultivar can change the structure of the

294
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,200
medicinal flowers and it um like we've

295
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:18,519
seen stuff where it can

296
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,560
actually um we can see stuff where it

297
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,078
looks like it's from a completely

298
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:22,679
different planet and then we've seen

299
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:26,679
stuff that looks the same but has

300
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:30,039
different Co um different properties so

301
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:31,879
it it's really um like am I saying one

302
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:33,439
is better than the other I'm saying that

303
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:35,000
there's a lot of cultiv that like a

304
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,040
warmer Spectrum but there's also a lot

305
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,278
of cultivos that like a um a cooler

306
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:42,078
Spectrum to be able to say that one

307
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:44,039
spectrum is the best Spectrum I don't

308
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,239
believe you can do that because all like

309
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,360
to find out what the true genetic

310
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,399
potential you have to test it and

311
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,959
cultivos can act completely different so

312
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:57,440
then next this is a regular double-ended

313
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,879
HPS versus the warm white channel that

314
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,760
we've made in one of our Spectrum tuning

315
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,159
lights

316
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:05,759
and you can see that it is the

317
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:07,838
temperature is almost the same like the

318
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,919
only thing that's really different uh

319
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:14,199
different is there's 5.3% far red and

320
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:16,479
when the double-ended HPS has 10.4% and

321
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:18,399
the blue they're slightly more blue um

322
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,120
but we can actually adjust that and add

323
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,278
it to balance everything so it's

324
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:26,078
actually the same so um I believe if you

325
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,240
want to get HPS results under LED you

326
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,958
need to use the same temperature we have

327
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:35,000
tested m multiple different um side by

328
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:36,559
sides and seeing very similar results um

329
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
people a lot of people like to throw out

330
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,958
radiant heat and say it's the radiant

331
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,320
heat that's making this difference and

332
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:46,599
that I I completely disagree when when

333
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,199
you're going in transitioning from HPS

334
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,399
to LED you want to actually keep the

335
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:54,078
same surface Leaf temperature so to

336
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:56,198
achieve that you actually want to go to

337
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:57,719
a successful dumble like a successful

338
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:59,919
HBS room if you're trying to get those

339
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,160
same results and figure what the hottest

340
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,838
point is so as soon as the AC is going

341
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,240
to turn on you're going to know that

342
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,560
that's the hottest point of the room so

343
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,919
you can run into the room and take a

344
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,799
bunch of surface Leaf temperature

345
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:13,599
readings and say this is my hottest

346
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:16,000
point now when the AC turns off I have

347
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,800
the coolest point now I know what that

348
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,839
range is now I can go into my LED room

349
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,198
and adjust my ambient temperature until

350
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:25,079
I'm hitting that range trying to go by

351
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:28,399
ambient temperature is like shooting

352
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:30,278
yourself in the foot because if you it

353
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,120
depends if you have it higher up one

354
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:34,759
higher up than the other one it could be

355
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,519
totally different because heat rises and

356
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:39,759
so I think everything should always go

357
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,198
by um surface Leaf temperature you

358
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,799
should never go by an ambient

359
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:44,879
temperature because it can really screw

360
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,399
with your mind with Spectrum tuning like

361
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:47,879
if someone is going to want a spectrum

362
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,839
tune they should ask themselves are they

363
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:53,120
trying to grow the highest quality

364
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,519
possible and if that is the qu if if

365
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,959
that is your goal then yes absolutely

366
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,519
Spectrum tuning is going to be the

367
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,958
answer and the other question is are you

368
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,600
trying to find the true genetic

369
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:06,559
potential well without Spectrum tuning

370
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,759
it's going to be almost impossible like

371
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:11,599
what are the major um like there's three

372
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:15,759
major benefits to Spectrum tuning that I

373
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,240
see and that is being able to use blue

374
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,480
to tighten your intern node spacing as

375
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,079
much as possible and secondly to be able

376
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,399
to use blue at any time to limit your

377
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,039
stretch as much as possible so a lot of

378
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,958
people are tent Growers if you're in a

379
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:33,078
tent and you might be limiting in height

380
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:36,000
the ability to use the extra blue is

381
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:39,319
lifechanging then the ability to add

382
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,799
blue later on in later on for the last

383
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,320
few weeks of the flower is also

384
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:47,879
life-changing and it can um for

385
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,959
increasing your coas it it's just um

386
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:51,720
it's undeniable the results that you can

387
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:54,000
get a couple things that stick out on

388
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,920
the charts that you had shown which is

389
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,839
the double-ended HPS slide

390
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:01,278
3.96% blue I didn't realize you know CU

391
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,639
I've grown with HPS before I didn't

392
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,919
realize it was that low in blue like

393
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:08,039
these days most many fixtures are in

394
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,799
between like the 15 and 20% range of

395
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:11,719
blue so that kind of is one thing that

396
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:14,639
stuck out to me the other thing that

397
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,920
really stuck out to me was I I wasn't

398
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:20,320
aware that 6 Dixie nanometers was the

399
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:22,838
highest efficiency for lowest cost I

400
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,800
think uh knowing that information and

401
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,800
seeing the different lighting companies

402
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:30,120
out there you can tell who is just going

403
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:32,519
after trying to to make things kind of

404
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,799
more uh price efficient I guess you

405
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,278
could say absolutely like um I think

406
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,719
it's a big problem because like

407
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,039
especially when I think about Growers

408
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,800
and people that are having buying

409
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,639
something that's going to be lasting

410
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:45,679
them for you know for 5 years if their

411
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,440
goal is to be like the sun you

412
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,318
definitely want the Fuller Spectrum um

413
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,120
and like now I'd like to kind of explain

414
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:54,078
what is Spectrum tuning because it can

415
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,120
kind of be kind of confusing what is a

416
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,439
spectrum tuning light well a spectrum

417
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,480
tuning light usually consists of four

418
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,639
different ch channels so one of those

419
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,199
channels is going to be warm white which

420
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,959
I like to reference is like a HPS

421
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,838
spectrum and then a cool white I

422
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:12,838
reference it as a metal Hy but it might

423
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,480
not be appropriate because a metal Hy

424
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,279
will actually have way less blue and a

425
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,120
lot of other stuff in it so I just

426
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,600
referenced it as metal Hy because it's

427
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,839
it's a blue color to your eye so it has

428
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,560
way more blue than a metal halight and

429
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,639
that is your cool white Channel then you

430
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:30,318
have a deep red channel that is 660 NM

431
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,240
that we were talking about that's highly

432
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:34,479
efficient and then we have a far red

433
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,440
channel so you have these four different

434
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,000
channels you you can do it all different

435
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,519
types of ways we like to do it with four

436
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,399
Independent Drivers and we have lights

437
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:43,959
that are up to 1500 watts and you use

438
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,600
them together to make all different

439
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:48,119
spectrums like a lot of people get so

440
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,079
confused about 1500 watts you still only

441
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,120
need to run it at 6 to 750 watts that

442
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:54,838
extra wattage is actually for the

443
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,959
diversity so that's kind of what a

444
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,199
spectrum tuning light is and we're we're

445
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,559
the first company that's actually

446
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:02,159
simplified Spectrum tuning by making two

447
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,759
channel Spectrum tuning lights so we

448
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,000
basically have taken the warm white and

449
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:08,879
instead of having a deep red and far red

450
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,519
on controlled independently we have

451
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,679
fixed it on the warm white channel so we

452
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,119
put it at safe levels where you you

453
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,759
couldn't do anything to ever hurt

454
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,798
yourself now when you have a four

455
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:21,000
Channel light there are things that you

456
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:23,679
could do to hurt yourself by using too

457
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,240
much far red or too much deep Reds in

458
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,480
certain situations well when you have it

459
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,120
um on the FL like that and it's fixed

460
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,400
it's basically simplified where you

461
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:34,239
can't do anything wrong to hurt yourself

462
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,559
which I think is kind of um it's the

463
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,400
future like when you have a light that

464
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:39,720
can do 500 spectrums or 60 spectrums

465
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,759
it's like well which Spectrum do you

466
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,759
want to do and it's like this really

467
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,279
simplifies it takes it down to about 12

468
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:47,679
spectrums like it's it's actually

469
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:49,918
capable of way more than 12 technically

470
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,200
but that visually look a lot different

471
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,640
on paper it's about 12 and you can still

472
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,080
have the benefits of going from 2,000

473
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,840
Kelvin to 9,000 Kelvin so that's

474
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:00,279
basically like a two channel spe

475
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:02,240
Spectrum tuning light and then what are

476
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,918
regular lights regular lights are single

477
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,480
Channel lights that have one driver and

478
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,919
it can be confusing for people so I've

479
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,120
been kind of trying to just break things

480
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:14,080
down as much as possible um so as we've

481
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:16,319
been developing it we I'm actually going

482
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,079
to share my screen here again because I

483
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,240
um we actually haven't published this

484
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:23,158
publicly but we are about to publish it

485
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,759
and it's um oh it's not it's not showing

486
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:28,280
the whole picture it's cut off but

487
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:30,480
anyways it's supposed to say transcend

488
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:32,119
light rest recipe and this is something

489
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,679
that we've developed and we're just

490
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:36,199
getting ready to publish the results but

491
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,519
I'm working with a company in Canada

492
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,360
that just finished their fourth crop

493
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:45,720
with um consecutive making 20% plus

494
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:47,959
gains on turpins and THC so it it's

495
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,798
life-changing here in Canada for people

496
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,319
and like we you know we've seen multiple

497
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:53,639
people do it one or two crops but this

498
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:56,240
is four crops in a row where he had

499
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,799
already had um 20 different coas with

500
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,839
this previous culer so for us to make a

501
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,679
20% gain and also it's it's not like

502
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,839
we're just using one lab cuz anybody can

503
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,519
say one thing with one lab we're using

504
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,240
multiple labs and this is actually e

505
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:12,000
been being exported to Germany and in

506
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,839
Germany and Australia are known for

507
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,119
having the toughest Labs so basically um

508
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:18,639
we have

509
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:21,279
conclusively proven that you can gain a

510
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,720
20% plus gain by doing this formula and

511
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:26,558
it's just as simple as vegging in 9000k

512
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,720
to have the tightest internode spacing

513
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:31,918
as as possible and then when you're

514
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,360
coming into um when you transition into

515
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,480
the flower stage you're using a whole

516
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,918
bunch of cool white and warm white and

517
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,960
you leave it like that until your

518
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,840
stretch is done and then we transition

519
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,720
to a spectrum that's actually even

520
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:47,359
warmer than HBS slightly and we

521
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,120
basically use that until there's 3 weeks

522
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:51,879
left and you start introducing the blue

523
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:54,479
back in so you can see we've dampered or

524
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,320
we we lower the the far red when there's

525
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,279
three weeks left and we go back to heavy

526
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:01,000
blue and warm white and we on with two

527
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,038
weeks left we even reduced the warm

528
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,038
white and completely eliminate the far

529
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:07,400
red and in the last week we're finishing

530
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,158
a 9,000 Kelvin and there's a lot of

531
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,159
people that finish with 10,000 Kelvin um

532
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,840
when they're not growing with LED and

533
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,559
you know there's a reason why they do it

534
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:18,038
is the the the plants love the blue it's

535
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,639
almost like a stress response it's

536
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:23,079
almost the same thing that UV does and

537
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,400
it it allows them to enhance the THC and

538
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:27,399
Turpin I like how you broke it down

539
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,759
between different phases of growth and

540
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,559
what channels they should have on that

541
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:32,798
was going to be a question for you that

542
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,240
I was going to ask was if I were to buy

543
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,319
one of light a four Channel what what do

544
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,120
I run when and so it's really cool that

545
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:40,240
you actually have that broken down

546
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:42,239
already and you done testing and have

547
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,519
results that show what you can get out

548
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,400
of it so that's that's really cool yeah

549
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:47,839
there there's also another company that

550
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,480
well multiple companies but one in

551
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,720
particular that we've been working with

552
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,319
that um they're really finding out what

553
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,159
the true genetic potential is and like I

554
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,759
said we've seen stuff in the same room

555
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,840
under different spectrums look like it's

556
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,279
from a different Planet so what they do

557
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:02,558
with a test room they have a test room

558
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,240
where they have curtains in between the

559
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:07,279
light so they can't have crossover and

560
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,079
they'll run a cultivar with four

561
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,599
completely different spectrums and when

562
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:13,759
you are comparing spectrums one thing I

563
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,359
want to bring up is you want to have a

564
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,158
big difference when you only have a

565
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,278
couple percent you will not see any

566
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:21,640
difference so if you just try to add 2%

567
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,558
blue or something like that um you're

568
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,640
not going to see really a difference um

569
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:27,399
from everything that we have seen so

570
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,120
basically they're test they're running

571
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,519
the four different cultivo seeing which

572
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,158
one performs the best getting a COA and

573
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,440
then implementing that as their base

574
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:37,880
spectrum and still using the blue with

575
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,080
it so it's like that's and that's how I

576
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,480
was trying to say is if you're trying to

577
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:43,319
find the real true genetic potential

578
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,319
that's how you have to do it um like

579
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:48,158
we're using more blue than what the sun

580
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:49,960
has like the blue like the sun is

581
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,919
depending on where you are and located

582
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,480
on the earth is like around 25 to 30%

583
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:58,080
maximum and we're able to get it up to

584
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,440
closer to 37% and just um and which I

585
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,519
think is a pretty big deal cuz when

586
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,759
you're when you're using 37% blue and

587
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,599
you're also omitting the 54% red that

588
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:09,038
the sun really has you can do stuff that

589
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:11,359
you can't do outside which I think is uh

590
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,919
really taking things to the next level

591
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,199
yeah yeah that's really really cool now

592
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,360
when you showed the HPS the double-ended

593
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,600
HPS slide want to war back to that for

594
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:24,399
one second one of the things that it

595
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:26,839
shows is that there's a spike at 780 NM

596
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,960
and talking with growers in the past

597
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:31,639
people swear that hey this is the reason

598
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,000
why HPS shows different results because

599
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,480
of that Spike on the end what's your

600
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,880
take on that so that is infrared so it's

601
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,038
heat actually so I I disagree and I

602
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,520
understand why people think that because

603
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,000
um I could go back to that picture where

604
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:49,240
it's showing the HP what the new evolved

605
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
LED versus the HPS and the temperature

606
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,839
is so different so they think that hey

607
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,319
we can I've tried everything to match at

608
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,639
the same and I can't get the same

609
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:59,558
results it has to be the infrared heat

610
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,960
except for none of anyone that is saying

611
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:04,119
that I can guarantee they've never tried

612
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,440
an LED light with the same temperature

613
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:07,918
and match those same surface Leaf

614
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,679
temperatures one of the other huge

615
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,880
problems with transitioning from a large

616
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,000
HPS room a lot of people overlook this

617
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,440
they'll take out all their HPS and they

618
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,640
put in their LEDs and now their HVAC

619
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,080
system is completely oversized and it's

620
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,559
turning on and off very quickly well an

621
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,960
HVAC is like a big massive dehumidifier

622
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:28,678
that you want sized perfectly to be as

623
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,880
efficient and hold and it also helps

624
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:34,000
hold the temperature but um you actually

625
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,120
can have a really hard time running LEDs

626
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,798
if it gets too cold also so like your

627
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:39,079
surface Leaf temperature is really

628
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:40,839
important but if people are having

629
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:43,599
cycles that is bringing their surface

630
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:45,480
Leaf temperature down to 73 or 75

631
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,480
Fahrenheit that's a really big problem

632
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,480
especially in the earlier stages in the

633
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,038
later stages it can actually be an sop

634
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,558
to kind of lower the temperature as

635
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:55,480
you're you're going on got it that makes

636
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:57,359
sense one more question about Spectrum

637
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,200
before we move on so I have a lot of

638
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:02,479
folks here that know of Dr Bruce bugby

639
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,519
he is very knowledgeable guy Utah State

640
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,880
University has been working in the

641
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:08,798
industry for over 40 years very

642
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,240
knowledgeable about lighting one of the

643
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:13,400
things he had mentioned in one of his

644
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,640
videos is something along I don't have

645
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,798
an exact quote but something along the

646
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:20,480
lines of par matters more than Spectrum

647
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:23,440
I want to get your take on

648
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,919
that yeah like um I agree with that

649
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,640
statement but like I think that's a

650
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:33,000
pretty wide openen thing to say because

651
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:36,159
let's compare like par at 100% versus a

652
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,038
optimized Spectrum at 10% or even 50%

653
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,080
well we can't compete with that par so I

654
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:43,480
I completely agree with that par is more

655
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:46,398
important but when we're talking about

656
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,079
5% efficiency well here's the actual

657
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:50,639
thing is in today's age you actually

658
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,519
don't have to sacrifice deficiency when

659
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,520
you're Spectrum tuning you're actually

660
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:57,000
gaining efficiency and the reason in

661
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:59,200
well I'm going to say in 95% or more

662
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,278
cases you are because efficiency is

663
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,519
usually gained well there's some major

664
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,798
things that play a role in it the diodes

665
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:08,398
the bin of the diodes the quantity of

666
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:10,639
the diodes the driver that you're using

667
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:12,038
the efficiency on the driver obviously

668
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,159
the heat sinks and everything play a

669
00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:16,879
role too but mainly it's the driver and

670
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,080
the diodes and the quantity so that

671
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,480
that's going to play basically a major

672
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:22,678
role when when you have Spectrum tuning

673
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,519
lights I'll give you an example um like

674
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:28,519
we have a light that's got 5,310 diodes

675
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:31,519
and one that's got 5600 and we've got

676
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:33,158
ones in the 4,000 well a lot of single

677
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:34,960
Channel lights and most single Channel

678
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:36,360
lights have around a couple thousand

679
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,600
like there are some that have up to a

680
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:40,558
3,000 but most of them are like a couple

681
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:43,319
thousand so when you have over double

682
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:45,599
the diodes or more you're actually

683
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:49,278
running way cooler it's going to have a

684
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,759
way longer life um and it's it's going

685
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,440
to be more efficient in most cases

686
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:53,759
you're going to do other like if you

687
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,600
wanted to replicate somebody else's

688
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,519
Spectrum you could do it but more

689
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:01,558
efficiently so but I do agree I do agree

690
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:03,639
par is it is more important but when we

691
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:06,639
get to like a few percent if we're

692
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,520
trading 5% I definitely I I believe that

693
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,320
the optimized Spectrum like if I could

694
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:13,480
choose between a blurle spectrum or or

695
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:16,960
an optimized one and have 5% less

696
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,759
efficiency like in 2025 quality is the

697
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,159
most important factor it's got to come

698
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:23,278
first over efficiency I completely agree

699
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:26,720
with you so want to transition over to

700
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:29,038
UVC now this is something that has been

701
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,240
being used more and more and indoor grow

702
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:35,440
rooms not for particular to initiate

703
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,000
more plant growth per se but more for

704
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,600
pest prevention and elimination can you

705
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,679
talk to us about that yes well first off

706
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:48,158
I think in the next few years UVC will

707
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:51,960
replace 90 to 95% of all pesticides and

708
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:55,720
Predator bugs so absolutely um UV can be

709
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:59,519
used to combat bugs to fight mold and to

710
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:01,440
enhance THC and turpins so when we this

711
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,398
has been a long thing that we've took us

712
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,960
a really long time to develop um what's

713
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:09,158
called the tarantula predator and it's

714
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:12,079
basically a UVC light that's used to

715
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:14,600
fight bugs is the main um the main

716
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:17,119
reason and you know we've had a lot of

717
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:18,798
R&amp;D on it and things have evolved a lot

718
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,038
but it's evolved to the point where we

719
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,720
can it's immunity to thrips is what we

720
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:24,519
call it so if you've got a thrip

721
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,720
infestation you can wipe them out in a

722
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:31,200
little over a week by using 10 watts per

723
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:33,360
16 Square fet for 15 minutes a day and

724
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,200
which is is pretty it's pretty crazy

725
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,398
because in all my experience it's

726
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,480
impossible to do like to to be able to

727
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:43,719
beat thrips without a pesticide or

728
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,038
Predator bugs we actually experimented

729
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,600
with like because we've done a lot of

730
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:49,319
controlled experiments where we're

731
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:51,359
introducing thrips spider mites and all

732
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:53,678
that types of stuff um so we try to

733
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:57,119
combat thrips with Predator bugs and

734
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:01,120
like one of the biggest um cucumeris

735
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:03,079
sersi hypo Asis are three huge ones and

736
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,759
then I forget the pirate bug is another

737
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:07,319
one but anyways we would we'd ask what

738
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:09,079
the recommended amount would be and we

739
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:10,918
would order four times the amount and

740
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:13,319
introduce them to the room and not be

741
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:14,880
able to beat thrips like maybe control

742
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:17,119
them a little bit but um when you can

743
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,360
compare the efficacy it's not even close

744
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,518
we actually believe that using UVC for 5

745
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,278
minutes a day has a higher efficacy than

746
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:27,319
using six or seven different Predator

747
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:29,359
bugs as a prevention um so it we it's

748
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:31,278
not a cure to everything like U when we

749
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:32,918
actually our very first test that we did

750
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,038
we actually beat spider mites when we

751
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,440
were introduc introducing two to three

752
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,919
and then we got into tests where we're

753
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,519
introducing hundreds and we weren't able

754
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:42,679
to beat spider mites when we were

755
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,599
letting introducing hundreds to a plant

756
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:47,159
and letting them establish for 36 hours

757
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:51,319
but we were able to slow them down by

758
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:53,399
easily 90% um so like we have footage of

759
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:55,759
in like what they can do in 36 hours and

760
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:57,599
then treating it for 10 minutes a day

761
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:58,839
and then jumping ahead a week later and

762
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,879
being able to see the difference and

763
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:03,038
it's it's really life-changing um it

764
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,640
basically Breaks the Rules of growing

765
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:07,440
when we were developing everything um I

766
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,759
think that there's a lot of bad

767
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,360
information out there now UVC can be

768
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,839
extremely dangerous but so can sticking

769
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:17,359
your hand in a blender while it's turned

770
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:19,199
on you know so like uh if anything can

771
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,879
be really dangerous and like I think

772
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,200
that so many people have been scared

773
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,240
about or like scared from all this bad

774
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,080
information about it like with actually

775
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,558
other people's bad research slowed down

776
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:32,278
our stuff well it's not even bad

777
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:34,759
research we came across people actually

778
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:36,640
faking their research and the reason why

779
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:39,440
we tried simulating exactly what they

780
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,360
were doing they were showing spider web

781
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,640
spidermite infestations with webbing and

782
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:45,240
then showing it uh seven days later

783
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,000
clean and showing that they were only

784
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,720
using the light for a minute so that was

785
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,519
uh a big obstacle because we were trying

786
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,880
these treatments and not able to beat

787
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,640
everything and we're like okay well this

788
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,600
person is clearly faking their research

789
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,038
and that's why you don't know about it

790
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:00,918
so we had to go outside the box and we

791
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,599
started increasing things and when we

792
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:05,600
actually first started using using UVC

793
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:08,719
um we were beating thrips by I would say

794
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:11,000
97 to 98% using a 5minute treatment in

795
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,600
the middle of darkness and people say

796
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,278
middle of Darkness they think oh herming

797
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:16,558
and they get scared it's not enough

798
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:18,599
wattage to wake up the plants and the

799
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:21,319
light emits out and it's like a big

800
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:23,199
Spotlight for insects to come in and

801
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:25,119
they're attracted to it um so that's

802
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,519
kind of the theory on how it kind of

803
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:31,918
works well F at 5 minutes a day we were

804
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:34,200
in the top 33 to 30 in it would be hard

805
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,640
to find any thrip damage you could only

806
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,159
find stuff kind of underneath where the

807
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,200
lights aren't being treated or stuff

808
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:45,159
where it was off to the side and um it

809
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,840
it was really um what happened is I had

810
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:49,559
decided I wanted to try stressing the

811
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:52,278
plants with UVC to enhance THC and

812
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:54,558
turpins and I decided to do 25 minute

813
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:57,200
treatments to see what would happen well

814
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:59,480
6 days later there were no more threats

815
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,278
and we we could not find them anywhere

816
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,639
um there's an IPM specialist named

817
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:05,880
Matthew Gates who's based out of

818
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:08,240
California we flew him down to come in

819
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,760
and inspect the room um just to see if

820
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,759
he could find any thrips and you know he

821
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:13,278
spent a couple hours in the room and

822
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:14,839
like he was able to kind of see the the

823
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:16,200
footage too of when they were introduced

824
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:18,278
and everything he wasn't being able to

825
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,000
find anything and also there's a fellow

826
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:22,159
who's got a YouTube channel named BC

827
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,558
bubbleman um we had known each other for

828
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,919
a long time but we've kind of started

829
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:28,480
hanging out from that um point he takes

830
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,759
a lot of macro footage and he's into he

831
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,639
made inventor of the bubble bags and um

832
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:35,319
so he makes a lot of water hash so him

833
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:37,558
he had a big interest in trying to see

834
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:39,798
if he could find any you know any bug

835
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:41,638
poo or anything like anything left over

836
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:43,599
from any type of the thrips on any of

837
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:45,678
the flow and he wasn't able to and you

838
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:48,000
know after we had that crop we know that

839
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,240
hey we have broken the rules of growing

840
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,919
because I've been at this my whole life

841
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:54,159
and you've never been able to do this

842
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:55,960
previously and that's where um and then

843
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,600
then we also had something else happen

844
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:01,679
that was an accident um we had a timer

845
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:05,000
fail and I came into a room and had all

846
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:07,038
the plants just totally messed up and

847
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,440
the the the lights were way underneath

848
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:11,398
they weren't even really close to it and

849
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,240
that's when we discovered that the UV

850
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:14,839
it's almost like systemically going into

851
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,079
the stem and able to stress out the

852
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:19,879
whole plant and we we believe um playing

853
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:21,960
with these limits are going to be able

854
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,000
to push plants to be able to get a

855
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:28,759
higher turpine and THC levels like when

856
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,440
you use UVA um I part anticipated well I

857
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:32,000
supplied a lot of lighting for a lot of

858
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,600
different side by sides where people are

859
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,398
going UVA versus not and then they also

860
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:39,678
did UVB versus not and it was very

861
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:42,079
conclusive that the UVB had such a

862
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:46,240
higher efficacy where you saw a real

863
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:48,638
gain on the CUA where UVA was almost not

864
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,599
nearly as much like um there's just so

865
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:54,479
little UVA like just in the like even

866
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:57,398
for example in HPS there's less than 2%

867
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,200
UVA so I I think that the real gain is

868
00:32:57,398 --> 00:33:02,398
using like will UVB or UVC for the

869
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,240
future to actually push the limits of

870
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:08,038
real coas just to kind of like push the

871
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,319
absolute boundaries of it um I believe

872
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:12,079
anybody that's telling you not to use it

873
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:14,599
has never done any real research and

874
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:16,960
they're just repeating what other people

875
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:19,519
have said about it that's awesome so UVC

876
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,519
you said five minutes per day what is

877
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,960
the size of these lights and wattage and

878
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:27,159
where do you position the lights so we

879
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,000
actually um came up with an idea to make

880
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:31,080
them flow underneath we actually have a

881
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,839
Utility Patent that allows them to

882
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:35,439
basically you can get them at any level

883
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:38,000
so for every light that you have up up

884
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,558
above you have two 5 watt strips that

885
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,440
are 44 in long and they're basically

886
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:45,200
kind of floating underneath the canopy

887
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,679
and you can you can they spin 360° and

888
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,240
you can kind of get them anywhere you

889
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:52,360
want um like with certain with like bad

890
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,919
spidermite infestations we like to bring

891
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:56,199
the fight right to them and getting the

892
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,038
lights as close as possible um with

893
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,600
thrips you actually don't need to like

894
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:01,960
on the very first crop that I had and I

895
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:03,439
was experimented I was chasing the

896
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,319
thrips around like trying to get the

897
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,480
lights as close to anywhere where I saw

898
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:10,039
it and moving them constantly where then

899
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,480
you know at the very end we accidentally

900
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:13,398
wiped them out and then we just tried

901
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,960
using that from underneath and

902
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:16,679
discovered we don't even have to we just

903
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,599
have to have them mounted underneath

904
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,159
it's like I thought at first I remember

905
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:22,838
asking Matthew Gates I'm like do thrips

906
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,159
have ears is is this UV putting off a

907
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:26,838
sound because we know that you know it

908
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:28,919
you know the first 6 in is where it

909
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:31,878
really penetrates but for whatever

910
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:33,878
reason um it's able to give the effect

911
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:36,799
where it it eradicates them like we're

912
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:38,000
working with multiple universities on a

913
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,639
get on white paper so we're going to

914
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,679
have a lot of real data so right now

915
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,800
that's just a theory I don't like that

916
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,599
was just I didn't know what was

917
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,560
happening I can't even explain like on

918
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,639
the very first uh cromp I actually

919
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:52,039
thought that we disabled them from being

920
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:54,039
able to reproduce and then they died out

921
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:56,079
and they just died out by the end is

922
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:58,559
what I thought but then we just have too

923
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,359
many examples of just coming in and

924
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:03,400
cleaning out a room that's got a bad

925
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:05,039
thrip infestation in eight days so it's

926
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,200
just uh it's just super effective

927
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:08,639
against them I think it's it's like

928
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,960
almost like the cure for cancer for

929
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:15,118
plants because even if um to be able to

930
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:18,000
slow down like to to mess up a plant's

931
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,320
or insect's DNA and RNA because when you

932
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,960
screw up the RNA it's like how they're

933
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,720
thinking and how they're communicating

934
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,679
and they how they're they don't act

935
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:27,799
normally after their RNA is screwed up

936
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:30,239
so and we have some really cool

937
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,480
documentation of you know after treating

938
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,279
spider mites and you see them after

939
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,960
theyve been before they've been treated

940
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,680
then you see them 7 days later and

941
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,960
they're just all sitting there all slow

942
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:41,719
they're not doing what they're supposed

943
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,800
to be doing setting up shop and just

944
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:45,358
going like crazy so it's it's pretty

945
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,599
incredible I actually think it's a lot

946
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:49,759
bigger than medicinal plants I think

947
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,599
like food crops stuff like for like

948
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,359
greenh houses and strawberries that type

949
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:57,440
of stuff um it's going to be huge it's

950
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:59,880
going to it's going to make an impact on

951
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,079
um eliminating pesticides or like

952
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,119
playing a critical role in it so that

953
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,160
sounds like a complete game changer for

954
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:07,960
sure now I personally struggle with

955
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:10,358
fungus Nest does this work on fungus

956
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,599
Nest too well we've had a lot of reports

957
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:15,119
of it being extremely effective but I

958
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:16,920
like to be extremely conservative before

959
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,079
I say hey this is going to wipe

960
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,318
something out but I think it it's very

961
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:24,280
safe to say it's going to make combating

962
00:36:21,318 --> 00:36:26,279
anything a lot easier What's um they

963
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,800
work very well for flying rude aits but

964
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,680
we actually have tested them on was

965
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,079
someone that what's really incredible is

966
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:33,399
when the lights go out and you turn on

967
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:35,280
the Predators the flying rude aits land

968
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,599
right on the Predators it's kind of like

969
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,040
a best case scenario they come right to

970
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,318
it I we got documented footage of them

971
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:44,000
all like sitting all across predators

972
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:46,440
and there was a fellow that did this for

973
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,239
three days and then a couple days later

974
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,159
had them completely dead everywhere now

975
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:54,078
rude aphids um are could be impossible

976
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:55,838
to beat like that because like an adult

977
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,599
can spend the its whole life in the

978
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:00,159
medium still like just they don't have

979
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,160
to leave but it's just um I believe for

980
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:03,239
flying anything that is flying it brings

981
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:04,920
them to them and the same thing with

982
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:06,679
Predator bugs why Predator bugs would be

983
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,838
a waste of money because you're going to

984
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:09,279
just you're going to wipe them out

985
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:11,078
you're going to screw up their RNA and

986
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,599
DNA so they're not functioning properly

987
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:16,160
anyways got it okay and you mentioned

988
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,720
you run them during night why wouldn't

989
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:21,920
you run them during the day um just

990
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:23,519
because it it's so much easier for the

991
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,079
bugs to see it because while the light

992
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:27,039
is on it's a lot harder but when the

993
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,560
lights are out even though it's so low

994
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,358
wattage to her eyes it's just like

995
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:32,759
they're attracted to it like I I came

996
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:34,679
across um like this is a video done

997
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,760
years ago that's talking about UV and

998
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:39,318
that how insects see UV like I actually

999
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,240
really like having them like say if you

1000
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:43,039
got an entrance to a facility having

1001
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:45,239
these in like a a bunch of just the

1002
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,880
doorways of the entrance so that you can

1003
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:48,399
use them multiple times in the middle of

1004
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,000
Darkness so if something does come in

1005
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,119
you have a good chance of disabling them

1006
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,559
from being able to reproduce already so

1007
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:55,880
if they do make it in the room they do

1008
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:57,759
die out yeah I I stand by like I think

1009
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,358
that um you know it's it's just like

1010
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,680
anything it takes a little bit to catch

1011
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:04,400
on um but we we sell a lot every single

1012
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:06,399
day and I believe it's just evolving to

1013
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,920
the point well like in all my years of

1014
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,240
growing what is the worst thing to do

1015
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,519
when you're growing it's spraying

1016
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:15,479
everybody hates spraying pesticides like

1017
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:17,119
I hate it it's kind of nice when I guess

1018
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,800
if it's an essential oil that smell

1019
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,318
makes you smell like a spa afterwards

1020
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,200
would be about the one exception but

1021
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:23,639
there's very many or very little

1022
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:26,279
products that are like that but it's one

1023
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:27,719
of the worst things to do so to just um

1024
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,200
like I still think there's always going

1025
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:32,598
to be a place to use essential oils with

1026
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:35,399
alcohol um like there's it's cuz it's

1027
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:37,359
friendly the it doesn't hurt the plants

1028
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,559
um and you can pass any type of testing

1029
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:41,400
when you're using it and just as a

1030
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:43,078
because Al the bottom line is alcohol

1031
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,280
with essential oils can just kill a lot

1032
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:47,160
of stuff on combat like on contact so

1033
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,880
just using that the day that you plant

1034
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:51,480
or the day before you flip even if you

1035
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,680
don't see anything um I still I still

1036
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,159
recommend it what sounds like the UVC

1037
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:57,199
definitely makes things a lot easier

1038
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:58,559
when it comes to pest elimination I'm

1039
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,838
going to have have to try it out for

1040
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:02,880
myself okay so we had some technical

1041
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:05,078
difficulties my internet actually went

1042
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,800
out it is a brand new day those of you

1043
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:09,079
watching on YouTube see that I'm in New

1044
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,680
clothing so I wanted to address that

1045
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:12,800
first let's pick up the conversation

1046
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:15,159
where we left off I want to get into

1047
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,960
under cany lighting next now this is

1048
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:18,719
something that seems like more and more

1049
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,480
people are talking about and more and

1050
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:22,879
more people are using over recent years

1051
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,039
talk to us all about under canopy

1052
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,880
lighting is it worth it yeah it's it's

1053
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:29,000
one thing that when it first came out we

1054
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,599
were kind of I wasn't so sure about it

1055
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,719
just because of the science of it and

1056
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:35,200
light shooting up and um but we have so

1057
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:37,239
many different clients that after using

1058
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:38,838
it um like we've have dozens and dozens

1059
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:40,159
of clients that were using it and just

1060
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:43,159
the results are actually kind of

1061
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:45,000
mind-blowing I think it's um really safe

1062
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:47,559
to say that if you're a skilled grower

1063
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,800
you're going to make a 20 to 40% gain in

1064
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:52,960
your yield in the same square footage

1065
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,519
and at the same time turn C's into B's

1066
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,440
turn B's into A's and correct that

1067
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,480
discoloration throughout your canopy cuz

1068
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,920
anybody knows when you're harvesting how

1069
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,559
it's just so um the color is completely

1070
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,119
different and on the other flip side of

1071
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:07,358
that is like when you're also harvesting

1072
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:09,559
you realize that the plant is all dead

1073
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:11,440
and not doing well underneath and what

1074
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:14,440
it actually does is giving that added

1075
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,119
heat basically almost stabilizes the VPD

1076
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,639
and just makes your plants just way more

1077
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,760
happy I've always wondered if it was

1078
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:24,960
actually worth it or not and seeing 20

1079
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,920
to 40% gain is pretty significant I feel

1080
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,559
like a lot of commercial Growers are

1081
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,240
introduc producing it because of that

1082
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:34,039
but how about hom Growers those folks

1083
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:35,479
that have just you know 4x4 or 4x8 tint

1084
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:37,920
would you still say it's worth it for

1085
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,559
them I I definitely think so um

1086
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,318
especially if you have multiple tents

1087
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:43,599
just testing one anybody that I have

1088
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:45,719
seen that's ever added them in has

1089
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,920
continued to keep on adding them I

1090
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:50,919
actually believe that the future could

1091
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,358
be more of a less wattage up top

1092
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,880
Lighting on the side and underneath for

1093
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:59,159
really just pushing the limits of it

1094
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,559
because basically um well we're about to

1095
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:02,279
start doing a whole bunch of tests like

1096
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:04,318
we have under canopy lighting that's

1097
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,359
about to land so it's going to be really

1098
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:09,000
interesting to be able to just even test

1099
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:12,239
240 Watts underneath with two bars

1100
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,039
versus four bars dimm down to 240 watts

1101
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,078
to kind of see does this make a

1102
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:19,719
difference giving uniformity right

1103
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:22,000
through the middle um and and the sides

1104
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:24,559
because another huge weakness in rooms

1105
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,920
is upper side lighting anywhere like if

1106
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:28,318
you have um a big lit room well it's

1107
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,440
going to have awesome uniformity

1108
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:32,960
anywhere until there's a wall and where

1109
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,079
that wall is it drops off dramatically

1110
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,358
having upperside lighting is going to

1111
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:38,359
make it's going to be a huge game

1112
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:39,838
changer for people in that sense too and

1113
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:41,838
all you have to do is just look on the

1114
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:44,519
outside's part where you have a wall

1115
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:46,358
look at your U medicon your medicine

1116
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:48,318
flowers and then compare it to the other

1117
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:50,598
side and you'll see that it's just so

1118
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:53,960
much weaker so you mentioned 240 watts

1119
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:56,119
is that per fixture no that's basically

1120
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,679
um it's they're 120 watts per fixture

1121
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:00,119
and and we've been seeing people that

1122
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:02,039
actually add two to three underneath um

1123
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:04,039
for most of the R&amp;D that I've seen it's

1124
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:06,079
been with two but we've heard like if

1125
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:08,079
you have the power and depending on the

1126
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,560
size of the plants um people that have

1127
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,640
had three but that's some stuff that

1128
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:14,679
we're also going to be doing trials with

1129
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:17,279
where we'll have two versus three um two

1130
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:20,639
versus four different wattages same

1131
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,720
wattages we're about to just really see

1132
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:26,078
um how far you can push it we have

1133
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:28,039
actually a client that can actually get

1134
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:32,280
10 pound I know this sounds crazy but

1135
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:34,279
actually pulls 10 lb per 16 square ft

1136
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,000
but they grow ex vertically so they

1137
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,040
actually have lights all the way around

1138
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,559
it so they actually have they're they're

1139
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:41,639
pushing a lot of wattage but they're

1140
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:43,760
limited to square footage but nothing in

1141
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:46,078
restricting them in height so for the

1142
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,760
the cost of the power um it totally

1143
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,480
makes sense for them and a lot of people

1144
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,920
with like you know with a lot of

1145
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,800
Licensing they come up with these really

1146
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:55,639
dumb rules where it's um either plant

1147
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:58,200
counts or square footage and stuff like

1148
00:42:55,639 --> 00:43:01,519
that and so basically just um being able

1149
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:04,239
to take advantage of it of all the space

1150
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:06,239
and loopholes so these 120 W fixtures

1151
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:08,078
how long are they and then where do you

1152
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:09,719
actually you place them underneath but

1153
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,760
like how far away are they from the

1154
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:14,799
plants well um so there's a lot of

1155
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,160
different designs that actually out of

1156
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,480
over the 30 fixtures that we've made we

1157
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:22,039
spent more time designing this and we

1158
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:24,039
actually had four different um molds and

1159
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:26,400
we kept on kind going back and forth we

1160
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:29,279
actually started with a plastic um

1161
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,920
housing it's still aluminum inside but

1162
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,519
we started with plastic just for the

1163
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:36,838
risk of like a shock and then it just

1164
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:38,159
kept on um then you know at the last I

1165
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:39,719
saw a lot of people coming out with

1166
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,000
aluminum and glass and then we wanted to

1167
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:44,399
do it aluminum and glass and then we ran

1168
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,679
into issues with If a driver when you're

1169
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,880
not using a non-isolated driver and if

1170
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:51,118
it ever fails and it's attached to

1171
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,358
aluminum it could cause a shock so we

1172
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,920
had to come up with a different way to

1173
00:43:52,358 --> 00:43:57,358
make it really safe and then we decided

1174
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:59,240
to make it seamless so most underc canop

1175
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:00,880
have like a seamless connection so it

1176
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:02,679
just plugs in nice and clean and can go

1177
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,200
the whole way through well we came up

1178
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:06,480
with a floating design most people have

1179
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:08,759
it where it's mounted like to some sort

1180
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,039
of thing or resting on it well we had it

1181
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,720
so it's a way of making them float and

1182
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:15,558
when we tested that we used some really

1183
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:17,000
high powerered fans and we just to kind

1184
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:18,640
of see how it could handle it and we

1185
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,358
noticed that having a seamless

1186
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:22,519
connection looked like a warranty

1187
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:24,239
nightmare for us because you get a

1188
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:25,920
little bit of pressure and what we've

1189
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:28,118
seen and heard from other people is

1190
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,960
actually other competitors or some

1191
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:31,760
people are having issues because

1192
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,880
pressure on those where the connections

1193
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,599
are and it's causing lights to turn on

1194
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:39,559
and all different types of issues so um

1195
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:40,880
but to ours are 44 in basically and they

1196
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:42,839
have like a little connection so that

1197
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,480
you can just continue to daisy chain and

1198
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:47,639
it kind of eliminates that one part of

1199
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,599
it got it wow yeah I'm going to have to

1200
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:51,960
I'm going to have to check it out sounds

1201
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,240
promising as far as uh the results that

1202
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,358
people are getting yeah there was

1203
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:56,799
actually one other thing that I could

1204
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:59,679
add to about the under canopy and a lot

1205
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,920
of people like to use or majority of the

1206
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:05,399
industry uses a Heavy Deep Red Spectrum

1207
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,400
and because it's highly efficient and

1208
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,920
what I actually believe is that it it

1209
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,200
actually penetrates through the leaf and

1210
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,960
is getting caught because there's no

1211
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:15,838
other explanation because like um

1212
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,800
because clearly when you're shooting

1213
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:19,838
it's not the the light is not hitting

1214
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:22,160
from above you know and so I think it's

1215
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:24,639
really important I I've criticized deep

1216
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:25,799
red spectrums in the past and but I do

1217
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,400
think there's a place for them when it

1218
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,599
comes to underc canopy and also when it

1219
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:32,079
comes into like Greenhouse situations

1220
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:33,920
because um with Greenhouse you have even

1221
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,640
on a cloudy day you have all different

1222
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,280
types of supplemental light that fills

1223
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:38,799
in the Spectrum so even if it looks like

1224
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,359
on paper when you're looking at it like

1225
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,559
it's just a thin Spectrum or very small

1226
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:45,679
outside it's actually filled in yeah I

1227
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:47,800
can imagine that some of these new folks

1228
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:50,318
who are implementing these they could be

1229
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,960
potentially making mistakes with this

1230
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:53,838
because it is so new so thank you for

1231
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,039
going into details on how big the

1232
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:59,639
lighting is wattage distance so on and

1233
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,239
so forth now speaking of mistakes there

1234
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:03,358
are a lot of mistakes that new Growers

1235
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:04,879
can make that relate to lighting can you

1236
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:06,920
talk to us about some of those and how

1237
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,240
they can be corrected or avoided for

1238
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,440
better results absolutely I think one of

1239
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:15,039
the biggest mistakes that's made with

1240
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:17,200
LED lighting is intensity like too much

1241
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:20,079
or less is more in so many different

1242
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:22,358
cases and being able to measure the

1243
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,119
light is really really important the

1244
00:46:22,358 --> 00:46:25,679
only problem is there's so many tools

1245
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:28,400
for measuring the light that aren't

1246
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,239
accurate and that's a big problem a lot

1247
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,838
of them don't read far red and they

1248
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:35,000
we've you know a lot of them can read

1249
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:36,719
like 200 to 300 ppfd less than it should

1250
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,960
so like having something like an apogee

1251
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:42,239
meter that can read from 400 to 750

1252
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:44,639
nanometer um that can pick up the full

1253
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:46,399
spectrum it's it's Priceless because

1254
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:48,679
just to put yourself in an Optimum

1255
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:51,200
situation for every single stage down

1256
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:54,358
from like a baby to a Seedling like 100

1257
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:57,318
to 120 ppfd is just like the perfect

1258
00:46:54,358 --> 00:47:00,598
level and then from going into a teens

1259
00:46:57,318 --> 00:47:03,838
200 to 250 is a great spot like in

1260
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:05,838
vegging I I actually love 350 ppfd I

1261
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:07,960
think it's a just a beautiful sweet spot

1262
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:11,759
that the plants love I don't see much of

1263
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:13,480
a reason to go over 500 in any real

1264
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,839
situation like I see people with really

1265
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,838
large plants that try to like want to

1266
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:19,519
give them a little bit more intensity

1267
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:23,480
and then um like for if you're not using

1268
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:27,159
supplemental CO2 stain below 800 ppfd is

1269
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:29,559
really um it's really important and if

1270
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:30,879
you if you use too much light the plants

1271
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:32,839
there's a lot of times will tell you

1272
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,039
almost right away by just using slightly

1273
00:47:32,838 --> 00:47:37,599
too much you can get purple striping

1274
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:39,119
overnight on your stem if you use way

1275
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,599
too much you know you can get the whole

1276
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,440
thing purple overnight I've also seen

1277
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,119
where the plants like to do like a

1278
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,358
tooing where the leaves outside of the

1279
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,280
leaves will start closing and what

1280
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:49,199
they're trying to do is they're trying

1281
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,359
to close and protect themselves from the

1282
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,838
light that's another sign so just being

1283
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:56,960
able to measure the intensity in every

1284
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:59,318
single stage will optimize it and up

1285
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,199
your game huge like I've done Consulting

1286
00:47:59,318 --> 00:48:04,159
for some very big large companies and

1287
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:05,719
it's so rare I can only think of a

1288
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:08,558
couple times in my life when I've come

1289
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:11,039
into a room and measured the ppfd and

1290
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:13,040
it's been bang on it's either been too

1291
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:15,119
intense where it's hurting them or

1292
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:16,519
they're leaving meat on the table and if

1293
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,440
you like if you have if you're only

1294
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:22,639
hitting 600 or 700 ppfd in a commercial

1295
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,720
setting you are way under what um the

1296
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:26,039
true potential you could be yielding

1297
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:28,000
would be I've definitely made that

1298
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:30,800
mistake in the past where I just burnt

1299
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,960
the crap out of my plants from too high

1300
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,039
of light and yeah dimming it down not

1301
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,400
only is it reducing the amount of

1302
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:37,599
intensity that your plants are getting

1303
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,358
and your plants aren't struggling at

1304
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:42,079
that point but it's expanding the life

1305
00:48:40,358 --> 00:48:45,279
of the fixture right if you're running

1306
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:47,760
it at less than the full capacity

1307
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,559
absolutely yeah it it's just you know

1308
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,520
when I go back years and years ago I

1309
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,400
realized that hey we were having issues

1310
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:56,159
with light intensity in veg and we

1311
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,960
didn't know because we had these huge

1312
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:59,558
plants and they were way too close to

1313
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:02,400
the lights and we were blaming

1314
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:04,200
everything else but the light oh wow

1315
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,519
that's funny now you mentioned measuring

1316
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:07,719
par one of the things I wanted to ask

1317
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:10,639
you about get your thoughts on those

1318
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:12,318
phone apps that do par measurements have

1319
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:15,318
you familiar with any of those or are

1320
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:16,639
they accurate or not I I am actually and

1321
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:18,358
you know what now that I think about it

1322
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:20,480
I'm just gonna I can quickly look at

1323
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:22,519
what it's called because the there's one

1324
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,719
out of all of them that I find works

1325
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:29,519
better than the rest and it's called um

1326
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:32,679
ppfd meter grow light and what what I

1327
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:33,880
find um what's really weird about it is

1328
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:35,318
because you have all all different

1329
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,280
options to put different types of

1330
00:49:35,318 --> 00:49:39,920
spectrums and sunlight and everything

1331
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:43,599
and the stock option that comes at that

1332
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:45,680
says sunlight with 6,500k seems to work

1333
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,359
the closest to an apog meter and know

1334
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:49,399
like and I'm this is based off using an

1335
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:51,798
Android phone but we've seen anywhere

1336
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:55,039
from like around a usually around 100 to

1337
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:56,880
150 ppfd within it with an apy meter so

1338
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:58,358
that's the one that I like to go off and

1339
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,240
for whatever reason like if you put it

1340
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:03,400
on what the Spectrum would actually be

1341
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:05,318
closest to it does not read accurately

1342
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,119
but for whatever reason sunlight at

1343
00:50:05,318 --> 00:50:10,318
6,500k seems to um do that and I would

1344
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:13,000
take that all day every day over not

1345
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:14,880
using it like like there's just it's so

1346
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,199
easy and once you start measuring it you

1347
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,400
you can't stop because you you can just

1348
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:20,279
it's just it's just giving you that

1349
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,680
extra Edge that's good to know I

1350
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,359
personally haven't had a chance to mess

1351
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:25,879
around with any of the phone apps I have

1352
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:28,480
an apple G meter myself I had a couple

1353
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:31,000
different the meters I heard the spot on

1354
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,838
meter was was pretty good as well but

1355
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,318
yeah dialing in that light distance it

1356
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:37,400
can be so important and having a par

1357
00:50:35,318 --> 00:50:40,119
meter although they are expensive I I

1358
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,599
think I spent over 500 bucks for mine it

1359
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:44,318
uh it helps dial things in and make sure

1360
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:46,318
that you're not giving too much light to

1361
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:48,440
your plants or you like you said not

1362
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:51,759
enough to where you leaving some meat on

1363
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:53,838
the table oh absolutely absolutely so I

1364
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,799
want to actually transition over and ask

1365
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:58,798
a question not really related to

1366
00:50:55,798 --> 00:51:01,480
lighting but more so of your personal

1367
00:50:58,798 --> 00:51:04,599
preference strains getting into

1368
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:06,240
particular of strains name the top three

1369
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:08,640
strains that you've grown and what you

1370
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:10,598
liked about them okay yeah we're in

1371
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:13,078
Canada where I'm from there I think

1372
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:15,519
there's a big issue with name or

1373
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:17,920
renaming Culvers or like someone having

1374
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:20,318
the same name so just because I say a

1375
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,400
name does not necessarily mean it is the

1376
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:24,239
exact same name but um well the one

1377
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,079
culer that I had the most experience

1378
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:29,078
with and you know I had over probably 20

1379
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:31,480
seasons on YouTube at one point growing

1380
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:33,440
with was death Bubba so I have close to

1381
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,119
100 runs with this culer and I

1382
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,000
monocropped it across multiple

1383
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:40,440
facilities for over 10 years so um it's

1384
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,199
just a and a lot of people a lot of my

1385
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,559
American friends that have tried it

1386
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:47,199
would say oh this is heavy OG lineage

1387
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:49,640
with a touch of cookies and a little

1388
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:52,679
something else like it's um it's a

1389
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:55,598
special um Culver that I I just I've

1390
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:57,078
done very very well for it and I tried I

1391
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,160
have tried hunting for

1392
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:00,559
years like on in certain places trying

1393
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:01,838
to find something to replace it and in

1394
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,440
my whole commercial production I

1395
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:05,798
couldn't ever find anything to replace

1396
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,920
it so that was my number one there was

1397
00:52:05,798 --> 00:52:11,400
another one that was a Master Kush and

1398
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:14,559
again um like there's so many different

1399
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:17,838
MKS and MK use this was a special one

1400
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,319
that had a very high level of thcv the

1401
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:20,960
highest levels that we hadd ever seen in

1402
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:23,239
anything and what was also very unique

1403
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,720
about this culer it didn't get any

1404
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:27,318
purple it would just go yellow there was

1405
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:29,279
no purple no matter matter what you did

1406
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:31,519
it was uh so anytime when someone tried

1407
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,519
to say hey I've got this I could tell

1408
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:35,079
instantly that it's not because you know

1409
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:37,000
it's got purple in it that's definitely

1410
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:40,000
not the the culer that I'm looking with

1411
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,039
and it was just a it was a special culer

1412
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,679
and I I lost it and I it hurt when I

1413
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:46,880
lost it because I I loved it I didn't

1414
00:52:44,679 --> 00:52:48,598
grow it as much because I I couldn't I

1415
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,119
was getting the same or it didn't yield

1416
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:52,240
as as much as death Bubba but it was

1417
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:53,960
worth about the same so it came down to

1418
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:56,039
a financial reasons why we weren't

1419
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,119
growing it back then and then the last

1420
00:52:56,039 --> 00:53:00,318
one is old school one that goes back to

1421
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:05,119
the late 90s that was the the original

1422
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:08,039
BC hash plant that um I don't like if

1423
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:09,720
you're from Canada or even I would say a

1424
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:12,159
lot of people in California would have

1425
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:14,239
had the BC hash plant like in the early

1426
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,598
2000 still and it just just this

1427
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:18,759
beautiful ctiv I just the only way I

1428
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:21,119
know how to explain it is it just coats

1429
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,000
your mouth with this flavor like I I

1430
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:25,400
told that I was told that it was a cross

1431
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,599
between an Afghan and a Northern Lights

1432
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,519
Culver but I you know I don't really

1433
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,280
have I don't really know I knew that we

1434
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:32,798
grew it a couple times and I knew

1435
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,240
multiple people multiple people that

1436
00:53:32,798 --> 00:53:36,239
grew it over the years and it just died

1437
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:38,719
out but I would consider it the most

1438
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:41,159
valuable culiver out there in the world

1439
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:43,159
right now if I I would pay big bucks to

1440
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:44,159
be able to get a cut of it back all

1441
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:45,358
right yeah I've been asking that

1442
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:46,798
question recently because there's a lot

1443
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:49,199
of folks here that are shopping for

1444
00:53:46,798 --> 00:53:51,559
genetics and asking the the guests here

1445
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:53,598
what their favorites are it definitely

1446
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:55,559
uh allows people to do some research

1447
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,280
maybe pick up some things for themselves

1448
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:59,400
so before we end this I do want to ask

1449
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,440
you what the future looks like you work

1450
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,838
in the lighting industry you've been in

1451
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,760
there for a while now you've clearly

1452
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:08,519
been had a passion for it for a very

1453
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:11,280
very long time a lot of people say that

1454
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:12,798
lighting has kind of topped out now and

1455
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,440
there's really not much further it can

1456
00:54:12,798 --> 00:54:16,440
go however there are people that debate

1457
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:18,639
that what do you think the future looks

1458
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:21,280
like for the lighting industry well I

1459
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:23,440
think just like everything it evolving

1460
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,480
quick and I I believe Spectrum tuning is

1461
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,200
coming in a big way like at this point

1462
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,119
it's already evolved where you can get a

1463
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:31,919
spectrum tuning light for the same price

1464
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,838
as a single Channel light so I I just

1465
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:37,079
think that that is a huge thing I think

1466
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:39,558
UVC is coming in a big way and same with

1467
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:41,440
UVB everybody knows the worst part of

1468
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:43,400
any type of job when it comes to

1469
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,838
cultivation is sprin and just

1470
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,720
eliminating that and and the

1471
00:54:44,838 --> 00:54:49,519
contaminations nobody wants that so I

1472
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:51,439
think that that is a huge way using UVB

1473
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:54,400
to enhance your coas is going to be a

1474
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,639
huge thing under canopy it's making

1475
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,798
things a lot more profitable for people

1476
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:01,199
so I think that's coming in a big way

1477
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:03,400
like a lot of people are resisting it

1478
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:05,279
and like it's kind of funny cuz once you

1479
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,119
see them try it they're right on board

1480
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,119
right away so I think that that's um I

1481
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:12,119
think that that's kind of like the

1482
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:14,280
future do you foresee AI getting

1483
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:15,960
involved in lighting at all like one of

1484
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,079
the things that I've talked about on a

1485
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,199
podcast in the past is like how cool

1486
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:22,000
would it be if your lights actually had

1487
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:24,598
some sort of a sensor to where they

1488
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
could see the plants and detect if there

1489
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:27,599
was some sort of problem like too much

1490
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,280
light for example and then it would

1491
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:32,240
automatically adjust and send you alert

1492
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,798
there's a bunch of different things AI

1493
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:35,279
wise that probably could be incorporated

1494
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:37,199
into the lights do you foresee anything

1495
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,079
like that happening soon I do think I

1496
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:41,399
don't know how soon but I well I already

1497
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:43,680
know it's already started like that

1498
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,280
there is AI That's Coming that can

1499
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:47,279
analyze the plants and if there's any

1500
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,359
type of disease or anything going on

1501
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,680
it's going to report it like I think

1502
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:54,639
there is so much to do with Spectrum

1503
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:56,919
tuning also well just to find the true

1504
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:59,639
um potential of the each cultiv or by

1505
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:02,079
using different um different spectrums

1506
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:03,838
so having AI Incorporated in that and

1507
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,559
playing a part in I think it is it is

1508
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:07,159
coming in a big way like it will be able

1509
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:10,640
to catch something when there's a

1510
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:11,920
problem way before it happens like I I

1511
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:13,400
don't know the name of a company but

1512
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,680
I've already heard of it's a very

1513
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,280
expensive unit where it's some sort of

1514
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:19,919
like camera system that goes back and

1515
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,760
forth and takes Imaging and it's it's

1516
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,358
able to track like find if you've got

1517
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,960
bugs or insects so it's like it's doing

1518
00:56:24,358 --> 00:56:27,639
a really good job and it's like it's a

1519
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,119
sub destion I I don't have that much

1520
00:56:27,639 --> 00:56:30,598
information but I was recently hearing

1521
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,838
someone telling me about that I'm going

1522
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:34,559
wow that's that's really taking things

1523
00:56:32,838 --> 00:56:36,000
to another level well it's like they're

1524
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,280
you're seeing with big tractors where

1525
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,960
they're using electricity and zapping

1526
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:44,240
weeds so it's like uh you know that like

1527
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:47,039
more there's going to be more innovative

1528
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:48,759
ways I think of treating insects and F

1529
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:51,039
combating different stuff like there's

1530
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:53,119
breakthroughs on fighting mold and I

1531
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:55,200
think yeah AI I think actually is going

1532
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,559
to play a major role that's so cool yeah

1533
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:59,598
that would probably make things a lot

1534
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:01,480
easier for gardeners awesome well we are

1535
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:04,079
getting up to the hour mark here if not

1536
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:05,719
we might have already passed it but uh

1537
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,240
we wanted to wrap things up here can you

1538
00:57:05,719 --> 00:57:09,000
tell the listener how they can find you

1539
00:57:07,239 --> 00:57:11,879
and what you have upcoming in the future

1540
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,599
um okay well my I do have a YouTube

1541
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:15,480
channel all the con there's been

1542
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:17,720
probably over 1500 videos removed from

1543
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:19,559
it at this point but it it is alive

1544
00:57:17,719 --> 00:57:22,239
still with a Grandmaster level on

1545
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:25,400
YouTube on Instagram it's Grandmaster

1546
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:26,838
level and um for right now we have some

1547
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,519
pretty cool collab operations we're

1548
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:31,078
actually working with mercules from

1549
00:57:28,519 --> 00:57:33,199
Death Row Records he's a Canadian artist

1550
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:35,798
and we're actually making mercs and

1551
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:37,719
those are these glasses right here and

1552
00:57:35,798 --> 00:57:39,400
um we there it's actually a really high

1553
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:41,519
quality pair of glasses we actually

1554
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,798
licens the same frames that Prada is

1555
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:46,519
using and it gives you awesome

1556
00:57:43,798 --> 00:57:48,358
protection against the Sun or or or the

1557
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:49,838
grow and the grow room so like being in

1558
00:57:48,358 --> 00:57:51,880
there you got to protect your eyes man

1559
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:53,119
these lights are so bright so that's a

1560
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,119
really exciting thing that we have

1561
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:58,599
upcoming we've also been working on a

1562
00:57:55,119 --> 00:58:00,240
UVB UV a bar that controls them both

1563
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:01,680
independently that will be an add-on to

1564
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:03,879
every light we're hoping to have that

1565
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:06,358
done in a month and we've also I've been

1566
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:08,480
working on a microG green kit where I I

1567
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:10,440
actually had an idea to make a light fit

1568
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:13,480
in a 10 in or a set of Lights fit in a

1569
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:15,119
10in x 20in tray so basically you can

1570
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,880
get four trays come with it and the

1571
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:19,280
light folds out and anywhere where you

1572
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,559
have a 2x4 space you're going to be able

1573
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,480
to grow microgreens and we've come up

1574
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:25,400
with a new medium actually that's a

1575
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:27,159
cloth that's actually mold and UV

1576
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,720
resistant that that you can grow in one

1577
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:32,358
of the hardest things with microgreens

1578
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:33,759
is mold is mold so um and also the other

1579
00:58:32,358 --> 00:58:35,960
equation to that is it's going to come

1580
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,200
with seeds and as it stands right now

1581
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,880
there's a couple companies that almost

1582
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:41,439
have a monopoly in the United States

1583
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,440
when it comes to microgreen seeds where

1584
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,159
and we're going to try to end that well

1585
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,280
we not try we are going to end that and

1586
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:48,838
we're going to make it way more

1587
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:51,200
affordable so when someone buys it they

1588
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:52,960
can grow crop after crop after crop and

1589
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:54,159
be really affordable for people that's

1590
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,159
kind of what we have coming up in the

1591
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:57,519
next few months that's awesome

1592
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:58,920
definitely some exciting things there

1593
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:00,559
yeah I was going to ask you about your

1594
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,358
YouTube channel I remember you having

1595
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:04,280
like tons and tons of videos and I

1596
00:59:02,358 --> 00:59:05,639
wasn't sure if they they canceled one

1597
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,640
channel and you had to start a new one

1598
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:10,000
or what happened there do you do you

1599
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:12,598
remember when it was like everybody's

1600
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,119
channel was getting deleted yeah 2018

1601
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:16,480
yeah so like there was a point where I

1602
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:18,480
did 111 live streams in a row where we

1603
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:21,838
would have over a 500 person live

1604
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,400
audience 111 weeks and um you know if I

1605
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:25,838
would used to put a video within 24

1606
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,838
hours I'd get 5 to 10,000 views and when

1607
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:29,679
then it all started I just started

1608
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:31,838
almost everybody I knew was losing their

1609
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:33,399
Channel like even when NV closet Med

1610
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:35,318
grower Lost His Channel like at that

1611
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,039
time every like so we just started

1612
00:59:35,318 --> 00:59:39,159
removing everything and then going back

1613
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:41,200
to zoom and then I've never been able to

1614
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:42,920
get it remonetized so I actually just

1615
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:44,480
started a new channel too also

1616
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:47,079
Grandmaster LEDs that we were going to

1617
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,798
just try to do things because like I

1618
00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:50,720
just anytime I do something getting

1619
00:59:48,798 --> 00:59:51,920
complaints that hey I'm I've been

1620
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:54,000
removed or I'm not getting a

1621
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,760
notification or like I can't reach

1622
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,280
anybody on it it's pretty frustrating

1623
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,359
that is super frustrating yeah that was

1624
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,319
a it was a rough time back then I'm glad

1625
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:02,558
that most people got their channels back

1626
01:00:01,318 --> 01:00:05,480
I don't think 100% of the people got

1627
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,720
their channels back but most did so yeah

1628
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,000
we can only hope it gets better from

1629
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:09,759
there but I'll definitely have a link to
