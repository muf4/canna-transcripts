1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,359
what is up everybody feed that don't

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:05,250
only my name is Chris aka mr. grow it

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,349
and today I got a part test video for

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,199
you this is a 315 want

5
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:12,839
CMH grow light it has a vertical bulb in

6
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:15,119
it 90 percent reflective material built

7
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,160
in ballast and this actually covers a

8
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,019
three foot by three foot gross space I

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,240
actually got this one straight from the

10
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,189
manufacturer I was at an Expo in Las

11
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,709
Vegas the name of the manufacturer is

12
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,240
sino well I'm not sure what the spectrum

13
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,609
looks like or what color temperature the

14
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:31,739
bulb is unfortunately they don't list

15
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,660
that in the listing description I'll

16
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,189
lift this link in the description

17
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,229
section below so you can click on it if

18
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:41,099
you want to learn more I'm using that

19
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:42,779
apogee MQ 500 quantum sensor this is

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,558
going to give up our measurements in

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,670
ppfd for this part test video I will of

22
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,488
course let the measurements do the

23
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,000
talking I'm going to do distances at 12

24
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:56,189
inch 24 inch and 36 inches away those

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,140
are the most common distances for CMH

26
00:00:56,189 --> 00:01:00,769
grow lights alright let's just get into

27
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,770
the measurements

28
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:19,989

[Music]

33
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:17,090
all right they're the results for the

34
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:18,620
315 want CMH light the one with the

35
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,530
vertical bulb pretty standard

36
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,569
measurement there for 315 Watts EMH 36

37
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,840
inches is what I would run for seedlings

38
00:03:23,568 --> 00:03:29,089
clones 24 inches of veg and then 12

39
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,329
inches for flower although I might even

40
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,759
go up to 13 or 14 inches since that dead

41
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:36,110
center reading was about 1100 just like

42
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:38,689
I mention in the last part test video

43
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,819
you can get away with 1,100 if you're

44
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:43,159
running co2 but just keep in mind that

45
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:44,899
you could experience some burning in

46
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:46,459
that dead center cuz that is a little

47
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,829
hot I'd like to know if you guys running

48
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,420
CMH grow lifes what distances do you

49
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:52,129
have your plants on different stages of

50
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:52,669
growth let me know in the comments

51
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:54,680
section below

52
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:56,988
so I've lots of videos coming up more

53
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,870
part test videos I think I've got like 6

54
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:02,120
more videos so hope you guys are digging

55
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,480
these so far and yeah I will leave it at

56
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,219
that

57
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:07,000
thank you so much for watching and until

58
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:07,000
next time peace
