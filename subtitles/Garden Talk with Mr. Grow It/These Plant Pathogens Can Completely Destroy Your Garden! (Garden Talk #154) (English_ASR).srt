76
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,360
Freeman how you doing today hey doing

77
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,640
great Chris thanks for having me and

78
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,480
thanks for coming on to the podcast

79
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,839
today today we're going to talk all

80
00:02:55,479 --> 00:03:00,878
about various pathogens that can harm or

81
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,280
completely kill your your plants so

82
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,359
there are several different ones I'd

83
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,519
like to go over today and we might get

84
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,560
into more and I'd also like to get into

85
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,920
DNA sex testing but first can you do an

86
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,120
introduction tell us a little bit about

87
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,878
yourself and how you got into gardening

88
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,360
yeah sure so yeah my name's Jackson

89
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:20,679
farmer I'm the owner and operator of

90
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,000
farmer Freeman uh we're a plant DNA lab

91
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,439
based in Washington DC and we primarily

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,799
just perform testing services for other

93
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,120
Growers so our main thing is the plant

94
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,879
DNA sex test and then now we've ventured

95
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,000
into doing pathogen detection tests to

96
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:39,359
further help them with their plants um I

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,438
started growing in high school I'm 32

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,080
years old now um we had a I had a good

99
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:48,239
friend whose mom was nice enough to uh

100
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,719
lend us a closet and we built out a nice

101
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,519
little grow tent and ordered a bunch of

102
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:58,318
stuff from like H HTG Supply like one of

103
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,920
the one of the original like online uh

104
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:04,238
Grow shops got our seeds shipped from

105
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:07,479
Amsterdam uh just the the typical

106
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,640
startup back in the uh the mid thousands

107
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:12,878
and um yeah so that was 16 years ago and

108
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,839
these days you know I'm I'm living in a

109
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:19,879
different state living here in DC and

110
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,879
I've got the uh the tent set up and a

111
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:25,600
nice little outdoor patio awesome yeah I

112
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:28,560
know I was first introduced to you and

113
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,680
kind of your services geez how long ago

114
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,240
was that now five plus years ago or

115
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,079
something like that it was it was

116
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,639
definitely pre-co I want to say like

117
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,879
2018

118
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,639
2019 uh you you were definitely one of

119
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,879
our our first like um returning

120
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,879
customers and it's been a been an

121
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,399
awesome relationship with the uh the

122
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,360
shoutouts and everything yeah yeah so I

123
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,279
I a lot of my audience is familiar with

124
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,038
you through kind of me using your

125
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,839
services and promoting my videos and

126
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:58,079
stuff like that and I still use it to

127
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:00,198
this day by the way I sent over uh 12 so

128
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,038
I'm hoping to hear back the results here

129
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,960
by the end of the week hopefully it was

130
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:05,639
really fast turnaround time which we'll

131
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,279
get into all that probably later on in

132
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,199
this episode kind of the services that

133
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,478
you offer yeah that's a service that I

134
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,478
use and promote because I really like it

135
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:15,758
I believe there's so many benefits to

136
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:18,478
doing the DNA sex testing which we'll

137
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,759
get into later on in this episode before

138
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,240
we actually linked up here and started

139
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,960
recording this episode behind the scenes

140
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,000
you mention that you wanted to break

141
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:28,359
these pathogens up into groups first

142
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,759
group being viruses of viroids second

143
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,759
group being fungal root path aens and

144
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,160
then third group in pathogens affecting

145
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,840
flowers so let's start with the viruses

146
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,919
and viroids can you break it down for us

147
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,679
what are some of the different viruses

148
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:46,879
and viroids that affect medicinal plants

149
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,519
yeah thanks um so the viruses and

150
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,918
viroids um in this industry are are a

151
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:56,359
relatively new

152
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:58,758
concern um I think hop latent vroid was

153
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,560
uh kind of discovered and described and

154
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,919
and these plants it's just uh within the

155
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,519
past 10 years whereas you know a lot of

156
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,959
these other uh pathogens like powdery

157
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:11,839
Milo I mean that's been talked about for

158
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:14,638
decades um but yeah so these viruses and

159
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,799
viroids um hop plate and vroid is

160
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,918
definitely the most common and most

161
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,038
talked about

162
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:26,240
vroid um that's the the number one vroid

163
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:29,038
test that we do um and that's going to

164
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,079
you know cause stunting in your plant uh

165
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:34,038
kind of weird like narrow maybe

166
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:36,959
discolored leaves maybe leaves that are

167
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:40,399
growing at angles that are unlike your

168
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:43,439
other plants um you'll also notice your

169
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:46,959
your your flowers will be reduced in

170
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:49,439
size and reduced in quality um and

171
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:52,359
because of all that it's been a a had a

172
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:56,759
major economic impact on uh commercial

173
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:59,879
grow facilities and um yeah so since

174
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,360
it's been described and identified uh

175
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:05,039
you know companies like mine have been

176
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,439
able to develop tests to detect it and

177
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:11,000
now we're seeing um cultivation centers

178
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:13,680
you know by diligently testing they're

179
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,240
able to identify infected plants remove

180
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,319
them from their facilities and um just

181
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:24,400
keep their facilities operating at 100%

182
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,960
um it can spread quite quickly and so

183
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,359
we've we've heard of some facilities

184
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:30,399
basically having to chop down everything

185
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,319
and start from scratch and it's it's

186
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,799
heartbreaking to hear about uh some of

187
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,879
the other viruses would be beet curly

188
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,960
top virus uh lettuce closis virus

189
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:44,680
tobacco mosaic virus is one that gets

190
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:47,519
talked about a lot um all of these

191
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:51,360
though at least from what our lab can

192
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:53,359
tell they're incredibly rare um you know

193
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,360
we get a lot of submissions for tobacco

194
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,560
mosaic virus just because people will

195
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,319
see like kind of discoloration or mosaic

196
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,319
type patterning or patterns on their

197
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,039
Leaf

198
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,759
surfaces um but there's so many other

199
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:10,360
reasons that could happen like basically

200
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,919
any number of nutrient deficiencies uh

201
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:18,038
even genetics can can cause that um so

202
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:21,918
we we very rarely ever see a sample that

203
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:24,079
actually has tobacco Mosaic um but

204
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:27,959
people still want to test for it just to

205
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:31,158
be sure um and that's one that's been in

206
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:33,360
tobacco plants uh for a long time it was

207
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:36,319
actually like the first virus or or

208
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,479
viroid ever like kind of described in

209
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:43,879
Plants um and it can kind of persist

210
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,120
like if you're just um handling tobacco

211
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:48,879
or tobacco products you can get the

212
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,679
vroid on your your fingers or surfaces

213
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:56,439
and and start spreading it just like

214
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:58,199
that um beat curly top is interesting

215
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,640
because

216
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,640
um as the name you know kind of alludes

217
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:09,958
to it's from the sugar beet uh plants

218
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:14,519
and I think you know it's relatively new

219
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:17,000
to uh to our industry because um in the

220
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,879
past uh the plants that that we grow and

221
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,679
my customers grow have been like kind of

222
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:24,320
hidden or or relegated to you know very

223
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:26,919
confined growing

224
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,959
spaces um whereas these days you can

225
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:32,240
more easily grow them Outdoors in larger

226
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:35,599
Fields you see like a lot of traditional

227
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:39,639
farms start to incorporate this this new

228
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,959
um plant group into their um kind of

229
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,639
commercial operation and because of that

230
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:46,119
you know they're they're in closer

231
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:48,919
proximity to things like sugar beads and

232
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,720
then you start to see you know bugs that

233
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:52,958
would typically be found on sugar beads

234
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,720
start to just lit literally they're

235
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,759
called like Leaf Hoppers and they're

236
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,079
just little bugs that hop from from

237
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:03,039
plant to plant and uh because you know

238
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:05,078
our plants are now outdoors and these uh

239
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,519
traditional Farms we're seeing you know

240
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:11,078
new diseases pop up in them and so the

241
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,278
beat curly top virus the again it's it's

242
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:16,559
really rare we get a couple submissions

243
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:20,278
every now and then um rarely ever see1

244
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,879
positive um and and the reason that

245
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:25,679
people submit it is is kind of like

246
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:28,439
tobacco Mosaic um where the symptoms of

247
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,958
a lot of these diseases uh can be so

248
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,440
similar to each other other and just

249
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,159
very like I want to say like kind of

250
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,560
like generic looking symptoms um so like

251
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,799
a curling Leaf uh or narrow leaf or

252
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:44,359
maybe a bright yellow leaf are all

253
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:47,159
symptoms of uh beet curly top but that's

254
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,759
also symptoms of over and underwatering

255
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:52,679
and various nutrient deficiencies so um

256
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:55,078
it's kind of challenging to provide

257
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:58,359
guidance on if you should test for all

258
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:59,799
of these things um beet curly top is

259
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,720
kind of nice

260
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:06,958
because uh it's it's kind of regionally

261
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,200
confined um you see it like in Colorado

262
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:12,119
New Mexico

263
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,480
California um basically these these

264
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:19,039
areas where beet sugar beets are grown

265
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,039
um and and therefore you know we don't

266
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:24,000
recommend it for someone growing

267
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:26,599
outdoors in Maine for example got it the

268
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,078
be curly top virus and the lettuce

269
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,278
closis virus I don't know anybody who's

270
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:32,559
got those too and it's pretty

271
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:35,159
interesting to hear that you don't

272
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,479
really get many positives coming into

273
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:38,838
your testing center which is pretty

274
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,159
interesting here kind of a relief I

275
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:44,800
guess you can say that it's more of a

276
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:47,120
rare occurrence so are you saying it's

277
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,479
is it more rare for indoor Growers

278
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,399
versus outdoor Growers because you were

279
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,440
talking about be curly and kind of it

280
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,240
being outdoors and and transferring that

281
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,680
way would you see it's mostly Outdoors

282
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,200
that is's a concern yeah exactly like if

283
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,919
you're growing indoors um or even if

284
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,839
your Greenhouse is like very isolated

285
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:10,479
and not near any like um you know weeds

286
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,920
or you know like just random plants then

287
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,480
I don't think you have to worry about be

288
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:17,759
curly top maybe if you're getting a a

289
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,759
clone or a cut from a farm that that

290
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,720
maybe has beat curly top you should be

291
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,879
concerned but um yeah I would only

292
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,920
recommend it for like outdoor grows in

293
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:31,559
these certain parts of the country um we

294
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:35,240
we really just got our first beat curly

295
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:39,399
top positive sample uh a few weeks ago

296
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:41,000
and um it was interesting I I it was it

297
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:42,559
was so interesting actually that I

298
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,799
contacted you know one of the other labs

299
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,799
I work with and and they had never

300
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,759
actually heard of anyone having this

301
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,159
which it's funny that you know we all

302
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:55,720
test for these things but uh they're

303
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:58,198
still rare but it's just kind of shows

304
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,800
like how valuable our our crops are and

305
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:01,799
that we

306
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:03,559
you know know that we need to be testing

307
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:06,679
for this

308
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:10,319
um just to protect the crop at all costs

309
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:12,120
basically um but yeah so that other lab

310
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,480
was interested they're like can your

311
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,639
customer go and catch some of these bugs

312
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,278
you know uh let's figure out which bugs

313
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:22,680
are actually transferring this um how

314
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:25,679
long do they survive in the plant or in

315
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:28,000
the in the bug uh you know and I mean

316
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,519
basically getting to the to the basics

317
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
of of trying to figure this stuff out so

318
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:36,639
um it's all very new um it's an exciting

319
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,360
space to be in it's also

320
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,079
um you know kind of challenging in that

321
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,240
there's just so much on the line with

322
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:47,359
these diseases um as far as testing for

323
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:52,639
them goes um it's a little bit different

324
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:54,919
than um a test for these other pathogens

325
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,198
or plant sex um

326
00:13:54,919 --> 00:14:01,799
so viruses are RNA based as opposed to

327
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:05,838
DNA based so um you know just slightly

328
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:09,519
different uh collection of samples

329
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:12,440
preservation of samples and um different

330
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,240
kind of uh enzymes and stuff go go into

331
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,000
it I mean you can use a lot of the same

332
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,759
equipment but it is like

333
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,519
a uh we consider it like a totally

334
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:24,000
separate thing than than the plant sex

335
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,278
test or or these other pathogen tests I

336
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,480
had a hotlad and vroid test I submitted

337
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:29,559
into you and I remember going through

338
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,320
the process

339
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:33,838
maybe walk us through it here if I

340
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,399
remember correctly I had to take samples

341
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,959
of three different sections leaves off

342
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,198
of three different parts of the plant

343
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:43,359
and also the root is that how it still

344
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,519
is yeah so that's what we've been

345
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,320
recommending we actually when we first

346
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,879
started we weren't doing root samples um

347
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,320
until it just became

348
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:54,838
pretty pretty publicly known or kind of

349
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:59,079
like the scientific

350
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:01,360
consensus um started to to appear that

351
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:06,838
root samples are are going to be one of

352
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:09,159
your best uh sources uh to detect it um

353
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,959
and yeah so because we don't know that

354
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:14,838
much about your plants like we we don't

355
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:17,679
really uh we're very lowkey we Supply

356
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,880
you these um collection kits we do the

357
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:22,519
testing but we're not like prying into

358
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:24,159
your business we don't ask like a bunch

359
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:28,318
of information about your garden and

360
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:29,480
because of that uh you know we we want

361
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:32,679
to get like

362
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:35,000
a a well-rounded collection of samples

363
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:38,000
from your plant um so like you said top

364
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,360
middle bottom leaves um whereas like if

365
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,639
we knew specifically like if you told us

366
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,680
hey I have a brand new clone then we

367
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,399
might just say hey one one top Leaf

368
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:50,758
should be sufficient um so when we get

369
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,440
those samples we because we don't always

370
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:54,480
know like what kind of plant it came

371
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,000
from we generally like we'll kind of

372
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,199
combine all of those uh Leaf samples

373
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,919
together and basically just trying to

374
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:05,159
get a uh a good composition of the plant

375
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:07,159
a representative um a good

376
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:10,600
representation of the plant that makes

377
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:12,559
sense now as far as stability of viroids

378
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,120
I actually did have somebody on my

379
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,119
podcast before talking specifically

380
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,679
about hot PL and viroid and I took notes

381
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,679
on it and this far stability greater

382
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:23,479
than 24 hours it stays on most common

383
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:25,719
surfaces 7 weeks within water greater

384
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,519
than 90 days in fermented compost 6

385
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,560
months on most dried PL material several

386
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:33,399
months H blade en virid can be in your

387
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:36,559
soil or growing medium and then years

388
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:39,159
inside of a seed so very stable uh from

389
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:42,000
what I he and I was going to ask you

390
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:45,078
testing for seeds can people submit in

391
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,679
seeds fee to test so we've not validated

392
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:50,439
our hoplight and vroid test on seeds um

393
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:52,078
I think in theory it should be possible

394
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,480
but it's just like a little bit of work

395
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:56,958
that we'd like to do before we start you

396
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,399
know accepting your your money uh for

397
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:01,518
that type of service uh but yeah like

398
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:05,038
you just mentioned uh it's incredibly

399
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,679
stable we have um some Leaf samples that

400
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:09,679
will periodically pull out uh that we

401
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,798
know are are positive because we tested

402
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,360
them a few years ago and uh we'll just

403
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:17,078
you know every couple of months pull it

404
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:20,198
out test it it it just consistently

405
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:22,599
shows up positive so um I guess there's

406
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:25,439
nothing really in that dried plant

407
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:28,678
material that's going to cause the virus

408
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,919
to go away or viroid to to go away um

409
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:33,679
yeah so just like you said incredibly

410
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:34,480
stable um if you're working with dried

411
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,640
plant

412
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,599
material uh you should definitely you

413
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,000
know clean up your your hands and stuff

414
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:43,079
before you get into um the the

415
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,200
cultivation rooms keep me updated on

416
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:49,079
seed testing because I'm 100% down to

417
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,200
submitting stuff SE for testing I can be

418
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,759
your guinea pig if you need to yeah

419
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,400
great great yeah I'll do that one last

420
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,519
thing about hot PL vroid do you feel

421
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,200
it's ere exaggerated you have a lot of

422
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:02,720
people that are screaming hotl vroid

423
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,240
it's the worst thing to come around in

424
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,720
this generation is it OV exaggerated or

425
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,000
is it a legitimate concern that is

426
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,798
infecting some people say greater than

427
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,159
90% of grows are infected by this what's

428
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:20,879
your take on that yeah so we're not

429
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:23,720
seeing anywhere near that 90% of grows

430
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,320
um I think you know our results are

431
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,240
going to be a little biased because you

432
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:31,119
know we have a lot of people submitting

433
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,839
samples as a preventative measure as

434
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:36,239
opposed to us going into grows finding

435
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,918
the worst looking plants and sampling

436
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,839
and testing those

437
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:44,840
um but that's not to say like uh the

438
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:48,399
impact is OV exaggerated I mean it's

439
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:50,678
definitely uh devastating to to get into

440
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,480
a commercial grow facility I think if

441
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:55,798
you're like a a hom grower and you you

442
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,839
know grow from seed and you just do a

443
00:18:55,798 --> 00:19:03,240
couple Cycles a year for plants you you

444
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:05,240
know four to 10 plants I don't think um

445
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,240
you know it's going to be as impactful

446
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,480
as as if you're a commercial facility

447
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,679
where you know your your employer your

448
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:17,000
employees payroll is is on the line of

449
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:18,400
you know every single Harvest um so I I

450
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,119
think it kind of depends on who you are

451
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,240
and how you grow um but but certainly

452
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,639
you if you have it in your facility you

453
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,679
start to see that that quality drop that

454
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,400
yield drop and uh um you you have to

455
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:36,400
figure out how to how to get rid of that

456
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:40,080
or start over

457
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,519
um yeah yeah you you can't live with it

458
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:45,759
unfortunately that's rough now one thing

459
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:48,359
for the tobacco mosaic virus you ADM you

460
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,839
get a lot of submissions in for that but

461
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:52,798
not many positive results and I think I

462
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:55,678
have a good feeling on why that is you

463
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:58,000
see a lot of these websites that post

464
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,480
about tobacco mosaic virus and they

465
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,519
showing pictures of plants with what

466
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,839
looks to be variegation you know what I

467
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:07,639
mean so I think there's some confusion

468
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:10,038
people see variegation on there they

469
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,038
match it up to what people are are

470
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:15,038
showing as tobacco mosaic virus and so I

471
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,200
think there's some confusion happening

472
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,359
and maybe that's why you're getting so

473
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,519
many submissions in there because it's

474
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:23,639
just misinformation amongst the internet

475
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:26,558
would you think that's potential or what

476
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,280
totally totally um so we have customers

477
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:31,200
try to send us pictures you know and

478
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,839
have us diagnose based on the picture

479
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,798
it's like I I would I never recommend

480
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:39,399
you do that there's there's a whole lot

481
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:42,000
more context that that's needed to to

482
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,360
you know even just make a a guess on on

483
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,759
what it could be um like if someone had

484
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,719
a picture of a curling Leaf but it's an

485
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:53,279
indoor garden you know there's no way

486
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,960
I'd say that's beat curly top and and

487
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,759
and so yeah like you you mentioned um

488
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,960
the these people they'll go online find

489
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,599
a picture of tobacco a mosaic yeah it

490
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,519
looks like what I have and and that

491
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:07,079
happens with like um trying to diagnose

492
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:08,639
nutrient deficiencies too um where

493
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:10,960
you'll think you have one certain

494
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,520
deficiency just based on the picture but

495
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,840
if you like read the ingredients in that

496
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:16,440
bottle of nutrients you're using you'll

497
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:18,798
you'll probably have a better idea oh

498
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,400
wait this is totally missing zinc or or

499
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,440
something like that and that's really

500
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,720
more for like tissue testing right if

501
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,679
you to do tissue testing you could get a

502
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,120
more accurate diagnosis of the nutrients

503
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,360
in the plan right do have you ever

504
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,759
thought about offering tissue testing I

505
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,519
I know you don't do it now right uh yeah

506
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,000
no it's not something we do uh

507
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:41,960
definitely have thought about it um the

508
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,359
thing about the uh tissue testing uh

509
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,880
plant nutrient

510
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:49,439
testing

511
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:52,120
um at least from what I understand like

512
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:56,120
the the sample quality is going to have

513
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:58,959
a big impact um like you maybe want uh

514
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:02,000
fresh like non-dried samples makes it a

515
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,519
little more challenging to um you know

516
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,079
submit to the

517
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:09,599
laboratory um any kind of degradation

518
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:11,678
during Transit could could impact it um

519
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,639
whereas like with these genetic based

520
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,360
tests like like that RNA and that DNA

521
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,360
that we're scanning for is going to be

522
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:23,719
very stable uh regardless of the sample

523
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:25,199
quality um so so that's primarily why we

524
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,919
don't do it is because we don't want to

525
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,880
have to deal with like trying to keep

526
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:34,919
all this stuff fresh it's it's also you

527
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:39,600
know larger we need like whole leaves uh

528
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:43,038
stems stalks things like that um and it

529
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:44,918
just requires like a larger facility we

530
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,640
can do like a whole lot with just the

531
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:50,200
small space that we're currently in so

532
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,038
uh you know when we work with genetics

533
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,798
understood let's move on to fungal Ruth

534
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,919
pathogens talk to us all about those

535
00:22:55,798 --> 00:23:02,558
yeah so that's going to be primarily

536
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:05,440
fuser ium and pums uh pythium species so

537
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:09,240
these are kind of newer tests that we

538
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:13,440
offer um where we're generally testing

539
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:15,159
uh root samples of plants um you

540
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,720
definitely want to test your your

541
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:23,919
incoming clones incoming um moms things

542
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:26,200
like that um because you know once this

543
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,440
uh fungus gets into your soil or your

544
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,038
water supply it can be kind of

545
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,840
challenging to get rid of

546
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:35,519
um so yeah fusarium and pythium um kind

547
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:37,519
of unlike hoplon hopon will cause like a

548
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,798
slow decline in your plant quality but

549
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:43,038
it won't like outright kill your plant

550
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:45,639
uh ferum pythium will uh kill your plant

551
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:50,000
the pythium can cause uh Browning of

552
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:51,640
your roots root rot uh Crown rot and all

553
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,798
that kind of results in like stunted

554
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:57,400
wilted yellow leaves and eventually uh

555
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:58,879
death of your plant fusarium is is

556
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,240
similar where you start to see like

557
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,840
Brown dead areas of

558
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:07,480
roots um and you know again your your

559
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:10,119
leaves become yellow start wilting and

560
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,200
and it'll just lead to Total crop loss

561
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:14,399
so so yeah those are new tests that we

562
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,600
highly recommend we see a lot more

563
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,278
positivity in those two tests than we do

564
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:24,278
for for um you know other pathogens like

565
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:27,119
tobacco Mosaic or uh petritis um things

566
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:30,278
like that for the pythium corck me from

567
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:32,398
wrong there but is this really weighted

568
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:34,000
towards hydroponic systems like deep

569
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:36,439
articulture

570
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,240
rdwc I hear a lot of people who come

571
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,519
across these fungal pathogens because of

572
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:45,038
too high of temperature for example yeah

573
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:47,359
so if their water reservoir is over 75°

574
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:49,558
75° I guess you get away with it but if

575
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:51,519
it's upwards of 80° or even higher you

576
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:53,879
could potentially get pythium am I in

577
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:57,839
the ballpark there yeah totally I mean

578
00:24:53,880 --> 00:25:02,200
so yeah fusan pythium um they love hot

579
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:05,678
wet uh environments and um so yeah

580
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:09,120
hydroponic grow or even soil if it's

581
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,559
just like continuously watered uh you

582
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:14,119
know you're just creating a great

583
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:16,960
environment for those um uh species to

584
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:18,678
to uh thrive in so what would be the

585
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,600
solution to that do you know like is

586
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,240
there any like products or anything that

587
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:26,000
people can put into their dwc system for

588
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:29,720
example to help eliminate those fungaro

589
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,599
pathogens I don't know about specific

590
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,079
products uh there's definitely like

591
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:37,398
nutrient brands that will kind of

592
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:40,278
advertise like um you know these maybe

593
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:42,479
have like some uh

594
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:44,599
biocal uh properties within the

595
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,360
nutrients they they'll help keep your

596
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:51,199
your reservoirs you know cleaner keeping

597
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:53,199
your your Reservoir water cool is going

598
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,840
to be good to just kind of slow growth

599
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,640
of any kind of fungus like that okay

600
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,959
yeah I just started in dwc actually and

601
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,759
my main concern was keeping that water

602
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,159
temperature under control now

603
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:08,398
unfortunately my concerns have been

604
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:10,440
legitimatized because I checked the

605
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:12,959
water temperature inside like 80° so

606
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,240
like I'm now and I'm I'm seeing Browning

607
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,720
on the roots so now I'm almost in you

608
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,240
know borderline panic mode now luckily I

609
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,000
don't have a real valuable plant in

610
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,798
there right now like I have more cuting

611
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,038
that I could use so I could eliminate

612
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:27,240
the plant that's in there if it gets

613
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:29,158
really bad but I am seeing the Browning

614
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,319
of the roots and there is concern for a

615
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:34,640
funger path pathogens so yeah I was just

616
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:36,398
wondering some background on that and if

617
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,880
there was a way to get rid of it or not

618
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:41,918
sure yeah um I mean there's

619
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,760
fungicides um that that can maybe Target

620
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,080
these specific uh species and cause

621
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:51,480
minimal impact or no impact to your

622
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:53,240
actual plant um so maybe check out those

623
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,159
um because I mean these have been

624
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,240
infecting um commercial crops ornamental

625
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,799
plants things like that you know and so

626
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,798
so there's like a lot of research that's

627
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:05,319
gone into these as opposed to these um

628
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:09,158
industry specific pathogens keeping your

629
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:11,879
plant just like generally um healthy you

630
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:14,360
know your plants have immune systems um

631
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,440
so if your plant is is happy and healthy

632
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:19,599
it's going to be better at you know kind

633
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,278
of suppressing the the effects of of

634
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:24,639
these fungus diseases if they're present

635
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:28,240
in the environment

636
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,640
um so you know but you know once you're

637
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,480
plant gets sick you know with fusarium

638
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,640
then maybe pythium or hopl and thyroid

639
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,200
finds a better opportunity to to come in

640
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,840
um or or vice versa got it and then as

641
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,159
far as the testing process you mentioned

642
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:44,839
root samples can you walk us through

643
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:46,278
that process so like you know if

644
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:49,119
somebody's in soil they're digging down

645
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:51,440
in the soil and and digging out a root

646
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:53,839
sample how long should it be if you're

647
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,720
in a dwc system you know same deal are

648
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,319
you just taking out and drying Off The

649
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,519
Roots and then putting them into the the

650
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,398
package to ship out or how's that work

651
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:05,120
you know this information definitely

652
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:08,158
subject to change like as we learn more

653
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:11,000
about best practices for sampling and

654
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:14,278
you know the kind of hot spots on your

655
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,440
plant um but yeah so for those right now

656
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:19,558
we we recommend root samples uh we only

657
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,200
need like one or two inches of root

658
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:26,918
sample we don't need a whole lot um

659
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,720
ideally uh cleaned off uh any like

660
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:31,399
excessive dirt and stuff stuff cuz

661
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,440
that's just going to save us a lot of

662
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:37,879
time in the lab of having to clean your

663
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:40,399
your stuff before we can even test it um

664
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,480
but yeah you'll kind of dig around the

665
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:45,119
base of the plant if it's in soil uh try

666
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,480
to pull up some of those root hairs that

667
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:51,398
are coming off that Central stock um or

668
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,319
like d dwc or or you know if you have

669
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:55,398
like rock wool on a flood table or

670
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:58,519
something uh you can just clip some of

671
00:28:55,398 --> 00:29:00,239
the exposed roots from there um and yeah

672
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:03,440
it doesn't need to be much it should

673
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,359
have minimal impact on your your plant's

674
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,679
um growth or health okay and then on

675
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:11,839
your website you have a listing for

676
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:14,798
ferium detection tests and then one

677
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:17,079
right next to it pan ferium detection

678
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,960
test and it's a $20 more what's the

679
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:21,639
difference between those two so the pan

680
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:26,600
fusarium test is going to screen

681
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:30,159
for uh more than more species um so

682
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:33,038
fusarium is is the the genus uh and then

683
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,960
there's like fusarium oxysporum would be

684
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:36,240
a species there's a bunch of different

685
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,798
fusarium

686
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,960
species um so the first test that we

687
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:46,119
offered was fusarium oxysporum

688
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:48,720
specific uh and just over time you

689
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:51,558
there's been development and testing to

690
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,120
to be able to Target more species and

691
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:58,200
you know be a slightly more effective

692
00:29:54,119 --> 00:30:01,678
test um we still have a lot of the fuser

693
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:04,159
oxysporum specific reagents so you know

694
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,240
until we run out of that we're we're

695
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,519
going to we're going to test for it okay

696
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,319
is there anything else to be said about

697
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,159
the fungal root pathogens or should we

698
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:16,918
move on to the pathogens affecting

699
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:19,200
flowers soil testing can be um something

700
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:22,840
to consider when testing for these

701
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,319
fungal root pathogens um so we you know

702
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:28,558
you can as opposed to like sending root

703
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:31,359
samples you can um I mean our lab

704
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:34,480
doesn't have like a a whole protocol for

705
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:37,879
this but you know in theory you can um

706
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,399
do a you know a test from the soil

707
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,720
directly to see if that fungus is is

708
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:45,839
present um and that can help you decide

709
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,759
like do we want to plant in this area of

710
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,879
the field or uh find a different area

711
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:53,240
that you know maybe it's not present or

712
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,480
maybe it's present in lower amounts good

713
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,679
advice okay let's move on to pathogens

714
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,120
affecting flowers talk to us all about

715
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,038
it what are they the symptoms what do

716
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:03,719
the plants look like when they're

717
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:07,440
infected so on and so forth yeah so like

718
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,960
you're you're above ground um kind of

719
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,519
targets um so the main things I think

720
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,840
the the the one that almost everyone

721
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:17,159
knows about is powdery mildew so that's

722
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:22,240
where you have those like little white

723
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:26,159
spots um you know on your your uh plant

724
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:29,839
leaves or within you know the the flower

725
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:34,519
itself um they start to emerge like

726
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:37,158
early on in the flowering cycle um and

727
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:39,359
basically just uh if you if you don't

728
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:43,440
catch it and get rid of it then you're

729
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:44,519
going to have uh a product that's

730
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,080
basically

731
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:49,599
unusable

732
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:52,199
um so generally spread through through

733
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:56,079
clones and just sharing it it's also a

734
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:58,919
fungus and what has been kind of debated

735
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:00,798
about powdery mildew is uh um you know

736
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:03,159
is it only on the surface of the plant

737
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:05,480
or can it be found inside of the plant

738
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:07,720
itself and um so there's there's

739
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:10,798
evidence that it it can

740
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,319
vascularize into the plant tissue so

741
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:15,119
even if you don't have any visible

742
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:17,678
symptoms of it uh we recommend

743
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:22,759
testing um especially if you're like in

744
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:25,919
kind of a a humid environment where that

745
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:29,519
fungus can can more easily

746
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:33,120
um grow uh then then we definitely

747
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:37,558
recommend testing for that um the other

748
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:41,158
one uh petritis is um generally called

749
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:43,638
Bud rot or gry mold um and so that's

750
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:48,519
found within the flowers sometimes you

751
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:50,439
you'll find it after you harvest um and

752
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:53,159
that can also just you know completely

753
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,200
wreck your your

754
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:58,240
um your product so yeah these you know

755
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,880
all of these

756
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:05,038
I recommend to test you know on incoming

757
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:07,880
clones I think if you're already seeing

758
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:09,798
these things come up it's not really

759
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,159
worth testing for I think at that point

760
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:14,759
you need to get

761
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:17,559
into um you know how do we how do we

762
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:20,158
remove this you know are there are there

763
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:21,638
products that we can apply to treat the

764
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,320
plant or should we just get rid of the

765
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:26,879
plant uh completely for the powdery

766
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:30,319
mildew you hear people trying to wash it

767
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:33,080
off if you a search on YouTube wash

768
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,839
powdery mildew or cantes put out a video

769
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:36,918
13 years ago and I remember when he put

770
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:38,199
this one out cu it caused caused a lot

771
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:40,799
of controversy where I think he's doing

772
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,759
some sort of hydrogen peroxide solution

773
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:44,879
and it's he's harvested the plant now

774
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:46,638
he's washing it in this solution and

775
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,480
then he's hanging it to dry after the

776
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:52,479
fact would you say that's an effective

777
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:56,319
approach or would you say that's not

778
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,360
effective uh I I don't know u i I think

779
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:59,798
if you're dealing with you know fungal

780
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:00,879
thing like powdery mil do I wouldn't

781
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:05,720
want any

782
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:07,880
moisture um but I'm not like an expert

783
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,720
uh grower like that one can probably

784
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,159
speculate that since you said it there's

785
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:14,239
evidence now that's inside the plant

786
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,800
that just washing off the leaves isn't

787
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:20,158
sufficient right exactly um yeah yeah

788
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:23,119
interesting yeah that video has 625,000

789
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,960
views so I can only imagine how many

790
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,720
people actually uh tried the process and

791
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,119
and you know potentially think they're

792
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,878
washing it off completely and

793
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,320
unfortunately might be internally in the

794
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:35,559
plant and they're consuming that so I

795
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,159
don't know for the buritis now this is

796
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:40,719
something I've come across before and I

797
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,838
had Bud rot I've told this story on my

798
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:45,398
channel several times not fun to come

799
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:48,239
across at all you know towards the end

800
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:49,799
of the grow these massive colas and open

801
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,158
it up in this Bud rod on the inside you

802
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,679
know but try to Sara what I did back

803
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,878
then was I cut off the infected parts

804
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:58,480
and I kept the other parts of the plant

805
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:59,719
and I consumed them

806
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,920
now some people say that you shouldn't

807
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:03,679
do that you should need you should

808
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,760
dispose a part the whole plant what's

809
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:08,199
your take on that I don't

810
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,400
know if there's like enough research I

811
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:13,039
mean the into like the human health

812
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,200
effects of like ingesting something like

813
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:17,320
that I think you know there's plenty of

814
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:21,000
better plant material out there it's

815
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,920
just not worth the the risk uh but but

816
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,239
yeah I'm not I'm not sure about that I

817
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,800
think one of the concerns is that

818
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,399
they're spores right it's so it's spores

819
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,480
and they're easily able to go Airborne

820
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,519
so if you're rumaging around with that

821
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,880
bud that has btis it's going airborne

822
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,079
and potentially getting on other parts

823
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,119
of the plant so I think that's what one

824
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:40,560
of the main concerns was but yeah I

825
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,920
understand that there's just not enough

826
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:46,039
research out there evidence to show one

827
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:48,480
way or the other right right uh so

828
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:51,960
another pathogen that we test for is uh

829
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:55,880
ret mites um so again we recommend like

830
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:57,880
if you getting a a clone or if you're

831
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,880
you know growing in an area that that

832
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:03,318
has had issues with those before then

833
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:05,920
it's probably worth testing um and we

834
00:36:03,318 --> 00:36:09,318
can detect just that russet might DNA

835
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,639
from from you know eggs or or anything

836
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:14,079
that's invisible to the naked eye uh we

837
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:16,400
can detect that on the leaf through uh

838
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,800
just genetic testing nice I wasn't even

839
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,760
aware that you offered that that's

840
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,800
pretty cool what does that testing

841
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,000
process consist of for the pathogens

842
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:28,560
affecting flowers is that the leaf

843
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,159
samples or yeah so we would want Leaf um

844
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:34,358
you know um I think if you're in a

845
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:38,440
flowering stage then leaves closer to

846
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:41,000
your flowers would be suggested uh if

847
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,318
it's a clone then just one or two leaves

848
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,880
from just try to get like a

849
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:48,759
representation of the plant um you know

850
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,680
we we can't test the entire plant

851
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,960
unfortunately because we would destroy

852
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:55,919
it um but you know we we want to get you

853
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:00,240
know a sufficient amount of material

854
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:03,400
that that leaves everyone confident U so

855
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:06,358
yeah so for those tests we we don't

856
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:08,599
bother asking for roots okay now are

857
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:11,519
there any other pathogens that we should

858
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:13,800
be aware of that maybe you don't

859
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,880
personally offer as a service to test

860
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,720
for but they're out there they're a

861
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,920
concern you don't have to get into

862
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:22,118
details on them but just kind of giving

863
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,920
us a list maybe and then the viewers

864
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:29,119
could conduct their own research yeah um

865
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:32,358
I've heard of like hemp streak

866
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:35,480
virus um not sure how prevalent that is

867
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:37,719
it's not something that we offer um but

868
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,679
yeah I really couldn't speak on other

869
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:42,679
other things like that I just I'm I'm

870
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:45,559
not like in that kind of research I

871
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:49,039
don't really have anything else on that

872
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:51,358
okay no worries let's move on to DNA sex

873
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:53,279
testing talk to us all about that what

874
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:56,440
is it what does the testing process

875
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,040
consist of so on and so forth yeah yeah

876
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,358
so this is like our uh bread and butter

877
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:04,039
at Farmer Freeman is uh the plant DNA

878
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:07,000
sex test so we basically help you sort

879
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:11,400
out which seedlings you want to grow or

880
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,318
not grow uh based on your your goals um

881
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,639
so obviously the female plants are the

882
00:38:13,318 --> 00:38:20,079
ones that make the flowers um that have

883
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:22,598
made this industry so popular uh whereas

884
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:25,400
male plants will make pollen socks and

885
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:27,760
once those open up and release pollen

886
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,639
your females get pollinated they convert

887
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,640
all their energy into seed production

888
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:34,799
rather than nice flower production so

889
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:37,239
definitely want to be uh eliminating

890
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,400
male plants as early as possible if

891
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:42,318
you're not interested in in using them

892
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,599
for breeding purposes um and so

893
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:48,279
typically in the past you would have

894
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:50,359
to um visually identify the sex of your

895
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,119
plant you know while it's in the that

896
00:38:50,358 --> 00:38:56,639
flowering stage at least like four or

897
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:59,079
six weeks after uh the plant sprouts uh

898
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:01,400
by but by looking at the DNA of the

899
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:04,039
plant we can tell you just you know

900
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:08,119
within 7 to 10 days after sprouting

901
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:10,318
whether it's a a male or female plant um

902
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:12,640
so all we need for that is just a a

903
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:14,440
piece of leaf or stem basically anything

904
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:17,559
that's going to have that plant's DNA in

905
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:20,318
it we can uh take that DNA out and then

906
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:22,880
we screen it for the presence of a y

907
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:24,960
chromosome uh which is only going to be

908
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,800
found in the male plants if we find it

909
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,039
we tag it male if we don't we tag it

910
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,480
female and say you know good luck with

911
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:35,039
the rest of your grow uh have fun yeah

912
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,280
so that's been you know just a huge time

913
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:39,679
and resource saver for our customers um

914
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,200
they're not having

915
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:46,358
to uh you know spend resources like um

916
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:49,399
water nutrients soil uh growing these

917
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:51,838
plants out for for an extra few weeks um

918
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,639
rather they're just um getting rid of

919
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:57,880
those plants before they're even out of

920
00:39:53,639 --> 00:40:01,039
like their their seedling tray um could

921
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,358
save you and and also I mean not just

922
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:07,000
the resource savings but the the risk

923
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:09,920
mitigation you know um no one's perfect

924
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,079
there's definitely stories of people um

925
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:16,358
not noticing that their plant is a male

926
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:18,240
um and that that can be reduced by by

927
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:20,960
actually testing rather than relying on

928
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:23,439
a a visual identification we definitely

929
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,079
recommend the plant success like for a

930
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,679
new grower uh because if you're

931
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,318
investing in you you know if you if

932
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:33,759
you're starting from scratch buying a

933
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:36,599
tent buying bags of soil um you're going

934
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:40,400
to save so many Resources by growing you

935
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:42,480
know only the the 50% of plants that you

936
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,160
need you know that that 50% that are

937
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,440
going to be female you're you're only

938
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:48,440
growing those only investing into the

939
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,800
resources to grow those yeah it's

940
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,880
definitely a Time Saver for sure like I

941
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,480
mentioned to you earlier I just emitted

942
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,119
12 in so I had seedling Sprout from The

943
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:00,199
Medium within I I think it was like day

944
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:03,200
four or day five after being sprouted I

945
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:05,000
had enough Leaf to take off samples

946
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:07,279
shipped them out to you now I'm just

947
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,358
waiting to he back but I guess once you

948
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,200
receive them it's said usually within 24

949
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:14,559
hours is I'm getting a a email back with

950
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:16,838
the results so then I take those results

951
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:20,318
and I can kill off all the males and

952
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:23,519
like you said Saving Time space saving

953
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:25,838
money on nutrients soil so like my goal

954
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,318
is to have a result back and not have to

955
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:29,639
transplant right I don't want to have to

956
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:31,639
spend time going from a Solo Cup

957
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:33,078
transplanting up only to find up it's a

958
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:35,838
male okay now I'm going to wipe that off

959
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:38,039
and then time wasted on that Avenue so

960
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:39,920
I'm a big fan of it I will uh continue

961
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:42,599
use that service been using it since

962
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,480
2018 or whatever we first we first got

963
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:47,200
introduced and I did actually send in uh

964
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,519
way back then I was like you know what

965
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:51,039
I'm going to test this service I'm going

966
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:52,480
to send in all feminized and let's see

967
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:54,400
what result and it was 100% accurate

968
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,318
it's always been it's been 100% accurate

969
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,680
the entire time I've I've tried it out

970
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:01,079
so and my experience it works I did have

971
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:02,199
one question in regards to this and I

972
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:04,560
think it's a big question it's probably

973
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:07,358
a common question for you is can her

974
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:11,679
Maite plants be detected during DNA sex

975
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:14,199
testing no so um yeah that's definitely

976
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:18,440
like our number one most ass question

977
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:21,000
and you know hermaphodite plants can be

978
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:24,280
either genetically male or genetically

979
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,440
female um most of the time you'll notice

980
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,200
it from a you know a a result that we

981
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,119
call

982
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:33,239
female um because that's the plant that

983
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:35,318
you're going to be keeping but if you

984
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:37,439
did keep and grow all those male plants

985
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:40,480
too you'll start to see that some of

986
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,200
them are also uh Herm and will grow

987
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,000
flowers in addition to their pollen

988
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:47,159
sacks um so unfortunately like that y

989
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,358
chromosome's not required for pollen

990
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:52,558
sack development so you'll still see it

991
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:56,759
come up and your genetic

992
00:42:52,559 --> 00:43:00,720
females um I don't think anyone's

993
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:02,760
identif ified like a a foolproof uh Gene

994
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:05,159
that can be detected that's like okay if

995
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,920
your plant has this it will do it will

996
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:12,159
be a harm um I think there's probably a

997
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:16,639
couple different um kind of like genetic

998
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:21,239
Pathways for a plant to to go through to

999
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:24,279
to um to start to express that

1000
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:27,959
um and so yeah so unfortunately we we

1001
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,680
can't but um if you know you know what

1002
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,000
to expect from your plants if you know

1003
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:34,118
like hey these these five should be

1004
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,920
female and these five should be male and

1005
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:39,720
they start to look off um then then you

1006
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,318
know you might be dealing with the Herm

1007
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:44,838
and uh go ahead and get rid of that um

1008
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:47,838
you know I I definitely think that

1009
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:50,358
there's some people out there who they

1010
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:52,039
grow a plant they see pollen socks they

1011
00:43:50,358 --> 00:43:55,239
think it's male they start breeding with

1012
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:57,440
it and they're unknowingly creating uh

1013
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:59,318
you know femin seeds uh because they

1014
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,519
didn't actually confirm if that plant

1015
00:43:59,318 --> 00:44:03,838
was male or female before they started

1016
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:06,719
using that pollen so yeah no we we can't

1017
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:08,519
detect uh Herms unfortunately when we do

1018
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:10,558
we will definitely let everyone know

1019
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:13,519
because I think that'll be a a huge uh

1020
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:16,040
Game Changer okay good to know so who

1021
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:17,599
uses DNA sex testing is it just hom

1022
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:20,719
Growers or you seeing commercial

1023
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:23,800
facilities use it a lot as well yeah so

1024
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:25,199
um by by numbers like the majority of

1025
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,640
our customers are going to be hom

1026
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:30,639
Growers or caregivers like grow you know

1027
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:34,719
under 20 plants

1028
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:36,519
um but then we do have uh a lot of you

1029
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:39,039
know cultivation facility like big

1030
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:42,318
commercial clients who are you know

1031
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:46,119
doing doing feno Hunts uh planting

1032
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:48,279
hundreds of seeds at a time and um then

1033
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:50,640
submitting those samples to us and and

1034
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,280
then you know just over the course of a

1035
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:54,719
day eliminating you know a couple

1036
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,480
hundred plants and and saving their

1037
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:59,279
their facility a whole lot of wasted

1038
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,599
space and time time um so yeah pretty

1039
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:06,040
much um we we we work with the the whole

1040
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:08,400
spectrum of uh cultivation stes and

1041
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:10,599
sizes okay and taking a step back and

1042
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,318
looking at the future what do you think

1043
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:13,838
the future looks like in regards to

1044
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:16,119
plant pathogens you think there are

1045
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:17,880
going to be new ones that pop up and

1046
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:20,280
what does the future look like for plant

1047
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:23,519
pathogen testing to foresee better

1048
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:25,400
technology coming about um yeah so I

1049
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:27,719
think definitely we'll see more

1050
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:32,599
pathogens start to be ENT identified and

1051
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:34,959
described especially as um these plants

1052
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:38,680
are start to be grown and environments

1053
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:42,880
that they weren't before such as like um

1054
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:46,118
you know uh traditional outdoor Farms

1055
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,119
you know they're they're then next to um

1056
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:49,880
a crop that you know no one's really

1057
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:52,119
grown it next to before and you might

1058
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:54,680
see some some kind of disease

1059
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:57,160
transmission um that'll eventually get

1060
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:58,039
described it's a whole new new industry

1061
00:45:57,159 --> 00:45:59,960
there's going to be a lot of new

1062
00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:02,519
environments and a lot of new things

1063
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,960
popping up that'll that'll come up and

1064
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:07,119
get described and then we'll develop

1065
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:09,559
tests for um as far as like the future

1066
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:12,160
of testing uh kind of like the evolution

1067
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:15,200
of our fusarium test where we were only

1068
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:17,358
testing for fusarium oxysporum for a

1069
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:20,519
while uh because that was the most

1070
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:22,358
common fusarium but uh eventually you

1071
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:24,639
know that that products evolved to now

1072
00:46:22,358 --> 00:46:27,480
test for multiple species of

1073
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:30,759
fusarium um I think you'll start to see

1074
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:34,880
more tests like kind of tests become

1075
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:36,640
more comprehensive in their scope uh as

1076
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:40,519
opposed to just like very specific

1077
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:45,480
single Target tests uh you'll also see

1078
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:48,639
you know testing price uh reduced as you

1079
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,838
know testing labs and manufacturers you

1080
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:54,598
know uh enhanc their testing

1081
00:46:50,838 --> 00:46:57,920
volume um it's just like the the natural

1082
00:46:54,599 --> 00:47:00,519
cycle of um how this goes it's kind of

1083
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,200
like a race to the bottom and and you

1084
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:04,000
know how cheap can you get your reagents

1085
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:06,919
how cheap can you perform the the

1086
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,079
testing service um so you'll see you

1087
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:13,119
know better scope better

1088
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:15,480
technology uh cheaper pricing you'll

1089
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,640
also start to see um there's a couple

1090
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,639
companies out there now but but trying

1091
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:24,639
to like you know let the consumer be

1092
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:27,039
able to test their plants themselves um

1093
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:30,078
so as opposed to like relying on a third

1094
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:32,599
party Testing Lab uh they can you know

1095
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:35,000
buy kits or buy certain pieces of

1096
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:36,160
equipment and perform these tests on

1097
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,039
site and so that's going to be really

1098
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:43,799
helpful for people like in uh in more

1099
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:45,920
rural areas um or if you like are just

1100
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,200
super secretive about your

1101
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,720
operation uh and you want to just

1102
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:54,118
maintain as much privacy as you can um

1103
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:55,679
then then that'll be helpful for you

1104
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:57,519
awesome yeah it'll be interesting to see

1105
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:59,358
what comes about in the future on that

1106
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:01,880
Avenue well Jackson this has been an

1107
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:04,000
awesome episode really informative uh I

1108
