1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,750
what's up everybody feel that don't know

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:05,099
me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,778
you'll watching my extra channel

4
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,359
I got another part test video for you

5
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:10,980
today sunrays sent me over there LED

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,169
grow light and in this video I will

7
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,960
unboxing it and also measure the power

8
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:18,448
output using my Apple gmq 5-under par

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,689
meter this mean your measures from 389

10
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,850
animators to 692 nanometers plus or

11
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,929
minus 5 nanometers and the measurements

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,868
are in ppfd

13
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:29,219
let's just get right into the unboxing

14
00:00:26,868 --> 00:00:31,349
first thing out the box is this thank

15
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:34,829
you card after that there's a user

16
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:38,730
manual next up is one light ratchet

17
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:41,250
hanger one wire hanging kit and a 5 foot

18
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:43,648
power cord pulling out the light I was a

19
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,289
little bit surprised by the size of it

20
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,899
because the listing says it's for a 3

21
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,969
foot by 3 foot grow space that's a core

22
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,009
coverage area however it was the same

23
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,840
size light as some of the other lights I

24
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:56,909
have part tested for a 2 foot by 2 foot

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,280
area it's like the gross starlight and

26
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:01,319
the minger light that I did part tests

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,390
on both of those lights are the same

28
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,890
sizes this one but does say I'm not

29
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,900
listing that they're using 90 degree

30
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,569
lenses so we'll see how those lenses

31
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,368
reflect light onto a 3 foot by 3 foot

32
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,109
grow space I'm not going to talk about

33
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:15,118
all of the grow lights features in this

34
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:16,469
video but I will leave a link in the

35
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,840
description section below so you can

36
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:21,780
learn more this LED grill that has two

37
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,329
switches on it one for veg in one for

38
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,579
bloom I plugged the LED grow light into

39
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:29,938
my kilowatt meter and turned on the veg

40
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,769
switch and it is pulling 121 watts then

41
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:33,809
I turned off the veg switch and just

42
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:36,390
turned on the bloom switch and it is

43
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,879
pulling 50 watts then I flipped both the

44
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,150
veg and the bloom switches on and the

45
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,890
agent is pulling 164 watts I hung the

46
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,868
light in the 4 foot by 4 foot grow 10

47
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,149
but like I said the core coverage area

48
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:50,368
for this light is 3 foot by 3 foot so I

49
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,430
try to keep my par meter within a 3 foot

50
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:54,780
by 3 foot space this part test is just

51
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,310
really to give you a general idea of

52
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,629
what the power output is for this light

53
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,820
it's not going to be hundred percent

54
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:01,769
accurate the reflective walls could

55
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:04,289
increase the numbers so just keep that

56
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:07,228
in mind according to the user manual the

57
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,719
manufacturer recommends a distance of no

58
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:11,370
closer than 20 inches so that'll be the

59
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:13,710
first measurement that I take and then

60
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,379
also do measurements at 24 inches

61
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,320
36 inches all right let's get into the

62
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:26,810
measurements

what do you think of these measurements

72
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:13,098
let me know in the comment section below

73
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:14,749
and I'll leave it at that thank you so

74
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:16,819
much for watching and until next time
