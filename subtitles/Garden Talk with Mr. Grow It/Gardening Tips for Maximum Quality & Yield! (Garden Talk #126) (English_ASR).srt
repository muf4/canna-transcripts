79
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,479
like a year five months four days and

80
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,598
three hours

81
00:02:55,479 --> 00:03:00,039
ago

82
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,598
the I'm excited for today's convers

83
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,878
ation but before we kind of get into

84
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,518
things can you tell us a little bit

85
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,560
about yourself maybe how you got into

86
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,439
gardening as well yeah you know i' I've

87
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,080
always been I've always kind of had a

88
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,639
little bit of a green you know Green

89
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,080
Thumb I would kind of plant some flowers

90
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,958
around the house I lived I come from

91
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,400
Northern California now living in Canada

92
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,080
I moved up here about six years ago yes

93
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,560
but I liked flowers and stuff in the

94
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,959
yard and when I moved up here I didn't

95
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,479
do a lot you know a lot before that and

96
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,280
then when I moved up here um they just

97
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,719
after I think I moved up here I think uh

98
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,438
the law got pasted that we could

99
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:38,680
legalize medic medicinal

100
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:40,120
plants and well I think the next year I

101
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,280
was here the next summer that was coming

102
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,519
up I I uh got a hold of a couple a

103
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,120
couple small plants and threw them on

104
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,200
the deck and really didn't really

105
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,640
figured I'd just kind of grow them out

106
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,598
like tomato plants more or less didn't

107
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,119
really know a lot about growing you know

108
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:54,119
because I was a truck driver my whole

109
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,239
life and so I couldn't you know I

110
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,719
couldn't consume anything yeah he got uh

111
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,120
tests you know regular random tests or

112
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,400
whatever as a truck driver so anyways

113
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,878
this was really exciting for me to move

114
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,360
up here coming Northern California would

115
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:07,598
have been a perfect place to grow by the

116
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,760
way but nevertheless nevertheless moved

117
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,438
up here and grew my first couple on the

118
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:15,560
deck and found out very quickly this is

119
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:18,478
not a really good place to grow this

120
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,000
type of plant because we had a real

121
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,240
crappy uh summer I don't think I think

122
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,680
it rained every day except for I had a

123
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,840
buddy come up and visit me that year and

124
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,560
he visited I remember he was up here for

125
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,719
in August he was up here for actual

126
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,560
summer it was just horrible but I grew

127
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,440
some really big plants just adding water

128
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,759
to some decent soil and some fertilizer

129
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:37,959
I suppose not knowing what the hell I

130
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,000
was doing grew some pretty decent plants

131
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:40,519
but of course I didn't know how to dry

132
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,879
and cure and I hadn't gotten on the

133
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:44,519
YouTube channels yet you got remember

134
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:46,079
I'm old right so I'm not on YouTube I'm

135
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:48,279
not doing all this young guy stuff yeah

136
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,319
you started on roll it up and yeah so I

137
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:51,439
went to a couple forums and got a little

138
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,879
bit of information but I don't even

139
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,439
think I got it yet I was still working

140
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,159
on my own so I dried it just doing what

141
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,918
seemed to be right I dried it just just

142
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,840
the most horrible stuff in the world but

143
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:03,719
I'll tell you what it was pretty bad and

144
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:05,638
we are in Canada in like uh you know the

145
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,880
west coast of Canada so it is it's just

146
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,519
dark and wet and you may remember your

147
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,680
first gross Chris I mean you thought you

148
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,279
were growing some great stuff right

149
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,918
because I'll tell you what my first I

150
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,159
thought I was growing the just anything

151
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,599
I thought it was the best stuff on earth

152
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,680
when you and that's one of the greatest

153
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,240
things is when you're growing your own

154
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,519
stuff even if it's bad it probably

155
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,079
tastes really good because you're

156
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:26,240
growing it right so and then um the next

157
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:28,758
year I said you know what I can't do

158
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,840
this outside let me try this indoors and

159
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,439
that's I think when I started getting

160
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,119
into watching YouTube videos but even

161
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:36,639
then I didn't look because my first one

162
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,199
was kind of a in the dark with a 4x4 and

163
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,478
some lights and that was four years ago

164
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,720
when I started growing indoors with

165
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:44,560
basic I just decided I was going to grow

166
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,319
indoors organically because why because

167
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,079
when I go to the dispensary that's the

168
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,560
most expensive stuff why do I want to

169
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,959
grow the cheaper stuff when I have total

170
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,519
control of it I didn't know why I was

171
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,879
growing organically I was growing

172
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,680
organically because it was so expensive

173
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,639
to buy organic and that was my basic you

174
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,959
know start in it and and that's how I

175
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:06,360
started I think uh in in a 4x4 with a

176
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:08,079
with a ts2000 two a ts3000 Mars Hydro

177
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,800
that's how I started growing and I

178
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,839
didn't start that way just to let you

179
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,439
know I was growing and then I got on a

180
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,598
forum and I'm showing some pictures as

181
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:18,120
um I'm starting to go into transition

182
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:19,399
and I'm showing the light somebody goes

183
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,319
somebody goes like this in in one of the

184
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:23,598
forms goes is that's a blurple uh what

185
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,680
you know what kind of power blah blah

186
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:27,399
and they asked me a few questions and I

187
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,280
go um it's a you know it is what it is

188
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:31,679
it's a blurple whatever it is and it's

189
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,478
it's it's it's giving me like really

190
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,560
good deal it's giving me like 200 Watts

191
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:37,918
for the 4x4 you know on flour but I'm

192
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,478
only using 100 Watts through veg and

193
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,318
honest to God this thing vegged

194
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:43,318
everything out really nice but really

195
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,160
low everything was really nice it filled

196
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,639
up the whole tent kind of vegged it out

197
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,360
when I before I went into transition but

198
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,079
I got this thing um in the in the um the

199
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,199
Forum in the Forum and I said

200
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,079
oh he's this guy's telling me I'm not

201
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,680
going to be able to grow good flowers

202
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:00,240
with the light that I have this blurple

203
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,160
so now I got to start doing research

204
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,000
there's a huge emergency like a research

205
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,599
emergency a little bit and I think this

206
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,319
is what really powered me into the

207
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,878
YouTube and started looking at other

208
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,759
Growers into getting and then you get a

209
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,639
lot of bad advice at this point you know

210
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:15,080
or or you're looking you're getting two

211
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,800
they're saying put 2,000 Watts you know

212
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:19,478
they're just so you start yeah you know

213
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,199
it's it's the excess that you get from

214
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:23,639
the everybody wants on the Internet seem

215
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,400
to want me to put too much fertilizers

216
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,240
too much water too much everything in a

217
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:29,679
grow yeah he was getting some pretty bad

218
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,639
advice at you know needless to say I put

219
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,439
that light in in the grow and it it just

220
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,560
did a beautiful job on the girls what

221
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:38,680
can I say it for the first grow but and

222
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,038
I got that light in there I ordered the

223
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,519
light just at transition so I had about

224
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,800
two or three weeks to get the light and

225
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,719
I was just putting that light in just at

226
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,240
about the second or third week of uh

227
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,639
flow just when it needed it and uh

228
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,360
turned out my first grow was just

229
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,280
amazing I was hooked ever since you

230
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,800
don't even know hooked absolutely hooked

231
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,000
that's awesome that's really cool yeah

232
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,560
200 watts in a 4x4 I'm looking I'm

233
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,038
thinking about I'm like oh jeez I don't

234
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,680
think that is enough 200 watt blurple

235
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,038
yeah so it's good that you were able to

236
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,959
kind of upgrade and and get through

237
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:09,959
flower and have a successful grow there

238
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:12,000
unbelievable tent unbelievable tent full

239
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:14,239
of flowers un unbelievable I still look

240
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,158
back at it and go man that was just a

241
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,079
gorgeous gorgeous growth to look on the

242
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:19,839
internet or to look in pictures it was

243
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,839
just one of those beautiful beautiful

244
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:25,959
canopies and even the canopy which by

245
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:29,638
the way I saw your uh Kyle kushman video

246
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:31,878
the other day oh yeah my Guru yeah he's

247
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,240
like the first guy I I I listened to

248
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,680
about when I went when I got to

249
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,200
transition on that grow and I or not

250
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,879
trans yeah when I got to transition and

251
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,360
about default because I didn't do any

252
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,080
lollipopping or anything on them but

253
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,639
when I got to transition um I listened

254
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,320
to I found a video of Kyle kushman and

255
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:50,879
he started talking about the uh U about

256
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,920
the super cropping and about the uh Kyle

257
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,519
kushman Chiropractic Chiropractic and

258
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:57,439
then hearing that on your show the other

259
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,240
day him talk about it I had no idea this

260
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,920
was we learned a couple things well I

261
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,680
had no idea this was him I thought he

262
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:04,519
was just kind of jokingly saying this is

263
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:06,039
kushman chiropractic which is what I've

264
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:08,240
always kind of called it thinking that

265
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:10,278
somebody else invented it I didn't know

266
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,120
if it was his invention but he kind of

267
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:15,480
he kind of he kind of coined it he kind

268
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,278
of said this was his so I respect Kyle

269
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,720
respect buddy yeah that was a great

270
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,600
conversation really thrilled that I got

271
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,480
him on there because he has just done so

272
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,759
much over the years 30 plus years doing

273
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,639
not only growing but Advocate as well in

274
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,559
the space so I think he pointed me in

275
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,439
the right direction um you know for the

276
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,119
first I've just gotten lucky I've gotten

277
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,320
some pieces and I and I talk about a lot

278
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,560
of things with golf you know you just

279
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,839
get some lucky shots and you know what

280
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,838
he was he was definitely my lucky shot

281
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,720
because I I got a way of doing it and

282
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,000
then watching a few um videos on

283
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,120
different styles that are people are

284
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,759
growing which was really cool but he was

285
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,959
basically with the style of you know

286
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:55,240
lollipopping and taking off everything

287
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:56,719
all the way up to the top node and uh

288
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,039
and not really going all the way down

289
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,879
the stem which is has I've just I've

290
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,078
just kind of gotten better at you know

291
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:05,399
with each grow and kind of also using

292
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:07,679
some common sense because I know

293
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,879
genetics you can grow some good stuff

294
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,599
and grow some really good U material all

295
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:14,559
the way down the the you know the stems

296
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,120
and get some really hard dense flowers

297
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,599
down the bottom but you got to know

298
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,159
those genetics and we grow different

299
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,360
stuff in our tents every grow because

300
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:24,719
remember I just started this I mean I'm

301
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,360
trying new stuff and still trying to

302
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,040
figure out what kind what I like and

303
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,959
what I don't like and I'm so I'm doing a

304
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,278
lot of experimenting so I'm growing

305
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,599
something different usually a different

306
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:36,320
feno a different genetic you know most

307
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,040
grows and I don't know how it's going to

308
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,079
grow off so getting those getting the

309
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,719
flowers all the way to the top and not

310
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,958
messing around with all this stuff I've

311
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,519
eliminated almost completely eliminated

312
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:49,039
lar in my grows which to

313
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:51,560
me that's the number one kind of thing

314
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:53,919
that you go for is like that who wants

315
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:55,479
to trim it hard dense bud I mean who

316
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,599
wants a trim lar that's the biggest

317
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,639
thing for me is you know you're in L de

318
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,560
I find myself now looking forward to the

319
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,919
trim I mean I look forward to it it's

320
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,399
just fun trimming dense you know flowers

321
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:10,240
abely he won't let me trim anymore

322
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,200
because it's so much fun I true true

323
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,000
yeah and that's a part of quality for a

324
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,639
lot of people is getting those rock hard

325
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,958
nugs versus more of a larier structure

326
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:20,959
and yeah it does come down to genetics

327
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,799
some are just going to naturally be ly

328
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:25,319
or Airy throughout the whole grow but

329
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:27,120
others you know with the right

330
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,720
conditions with the right nutrition

331
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,360
lighting so on and so forth you can get

332
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,600
that quality you're looking for and even

333
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,680
that yield you're looking for and that's

334
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,399
really what this conversation is going

335
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,000
to be about today one of the things you

336
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,600
mentioned behind the scenes when we

337
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,919
talking about what topics that you like

338
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,000
to talk about you mentioned that you aim

339
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:45,799
for both quality and yield and when I

340
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,159
heard that I figured that's a great

341
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:50,000
topic it actually reminded me of a video

342
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,480
I created ah jeez it's got to be four or

343
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,600
five years ago now where I talked about

344
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,200
why I grow small plants and one of the

345
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,680
things I mentioned in that video was

346
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,480
that I don't really need the yield I'm

347
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,759
just growing for myself so I grow a

348
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,079
bunch of different cultivars I aim for

349
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,720
you know a couple two three ounces so I

350
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:07,359
don't really focus on yield I focus more

351
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,278
on quality while people took that a

352
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,320
little sideways like hey you can get

353
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:14,000
yield and quality on you know so I

354
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,000
didn't mean to speak it like that but

355
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,679
for the most part having a conversation

356
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,519
you can absolutely get yield and quality

357
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,078
in the same grow and that's what we're

358
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,879
going to talk about today how you do

359
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:27,278
that CU that is one of your common goals

360
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:30,519
now before we get into kind of the the

361
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:32,799
details on that style of gardening are

362
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,919
you I think you mentioned your organic

363
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:37,439
indoors is that your kind of grow style

364
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,719
that you go for these days well I

365
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,800
started out growing with Happy Frog and

366
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,199
fox farm right all you know Fox Farm the

367
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:45,278
the ocean forest and then they stopped

368
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:46,759
selling it in Canada last year for some

369
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:47,838
reason it just it just and that that's

370
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:49,919
kind of what I went to in the beginning

371
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,279
because of course the forums every you

372
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,639
know you just go places in the beginning

373
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:54,078
where you're kind of directed you know

374
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,399
for so OB you don't know anything so you

375
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:57,799
just take some advice everybody's using

376
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,639
it so I did I that's what what I used I

377
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:01,359
I burned some seedlings

378
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,360
and then of course used a happy frog in

379
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,079
the beginning you know changed over

380
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,680
using Happy Frog but nevertheless they

381
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:09,439
stopped selling it and it it did what I

382
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,359
thought was a decent job but I started

383
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,079
mixing my own soil um using kind of the

384
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,480
Coots you know um method more or less

385
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:18,359
you know everybody takes their own spin

386
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,639
on it and I've taken my own spin on it

387
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,879
and just started because I had to come

388
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,240
up with a new soil um this this couple

389
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,799
whole new I think it was last was it

390
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,440
last SCH or the gr before something we

391
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,479
didn't have it something so anyway so I

392
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,399
basically you know the Coots recipe is

393
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,120
basically a third a third a third a

394
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:39,120
third drainage a third um compost and a

395
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,759
third pee right so I basically

396
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,879
everything I dumb everything down by the

397
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:45,360
way I dumb everything down because I'm

398
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:47,039
kind of dumb and and so that I can

399
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,320
understand it no it's so I can

400
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,360
understand it and it's almost hard

401
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,399
explaining dumb but let me try so I I

402
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,039
take my Peete right I take actually went

403
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,120
to prom miix because it's got the Pete

404
00:13:55,039 --> 00:14:00,078
it's got the uh it's got the perlite

405
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:04,078
already in it and then I add so I'll

406
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:06,439
take 2/3 of my Pro 2/3 promx with that's

407
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:10,439
what I'll mix and then I'll put in a

408
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:13,120
third um a third uh worm

409
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,399
castings uh with some some sort of what

410
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,799
would we call it compost with some I got

411
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:18,639
a bag of compost laying around for the

412
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,519
garden for outside I like to throw some

413
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,519
of that compost into just so we mix in

414
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,360
some more microbes or just get some

415
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:26,839
stuff that that that the worm castings

416
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,839
didn't have in it and and then I'll add

417
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:31,240
about a 10% more perlite and that's and

418
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,360
then I'll put uh gag green I use guag

419
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,159
green uh amendments organic amendments

420
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,560
and I use the 444 and the 284 and I

421
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:41,039
blend them and I think when I do the

422
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:44,078
main soil when I first start out with

423
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:46,759
the main soil I do that I do half and

424
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,958
half and they require three tablespoons

425
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:51,480
per gallon is what I do except it's one

426
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,599
and a half of each for this for the soil

427
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,959
and let it cook for like a month in the

428
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,839
garage in the garage and that's I find

429
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:01,359
that to be a real gentle mix for the

430
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,199
seedlings and and so I I so that's

431
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,800
starting right off after it's cooked for

432
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,719
a month we're good for seedlings and it

433
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,838
does a real good job on and then every

434
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,160
time I do an upot I add more amendments

435
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:12,040
to the soil like I'm going to be doing

436
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:16,078
another upot to a

437
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:17,919
1.5 and um when I go up to the 1.5 a

438
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,159
gallon of course that's going to be my

439
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,919
veg and they're going to be sitting in

440
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:23,679
there for six weeks yeah they're going

441
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,639
to be sitting there for they did last

442
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,838
six seven weeks but probably more like

443
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,680
six weeks and I'll do dryback on those

444
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,839
well I'll talk about watering but so

445
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:36,039
then I will add 444 and maybe like um oh

446
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,720
maybe I'm and I'm going to go less Bo it

447
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:39,599
really gets going but I'm going to add

448
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,360
less of that this time around because

449
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,519
I'm still trying to get the recipe

450
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,680
because I'm getting I'm getting some

451
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,639
tips you know little burn tips it's not

452
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:48,638
bad but I if I start adjusting my

453
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,799
amendments back I'm going to start I'm

454
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,639
going to get that soil perfect

455
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,318
eventually and I'm so I'm adjusting that

456
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:54,959
my mix is back and if people come out to

457
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:56,559
my show they'll they'll see my recipe

458
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,479
changing a little bit as we go through

459
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:01,758
it the recipe is good it it did a job

460
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,159
than I I think my soil has done a better

461
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,959
job than I it ever did with the fox farm

462
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,799
yeah and it it just sorry Fox Farm sorry

463
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,958
Fox Farm I think I found a new you know

464
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:13,919
I was forced to go outside of my little

465
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,119
comfort zone and go do something on my

466
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,399
own which is like I said it's it's I'm

467
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,839
I'm I'm really it was a huge uh concern

468
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,039
a huge worry like doing the last grow

469
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,360
without it well I started in fact in

470
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:28,000
fact I started um I was going to reuse

471
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,278
my song and I thought that sounded like

472
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,198
a great idea until until it just did a

473
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,958
horrible job on some vegging girls that

474
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,120
I had and I said okay we're only doing

475
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,919
four plants you know I don't need to

476
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,278
save the world by you know saving the

477
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:43,679
soil and I can also use it outside you

478
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:46,120
know for four for plants so I veg for

479
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,439
about 6 weeks and then before I do my up

480
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,159
pot for my transition and that's when I

481
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,000
and I I'll add a little bit of the 284

482
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:55,198
to that as well but not as much and then

483
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,278
when I when I go up to the transition to

484
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:00,599
the next pot up and I I pot up to seven

485
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:02,958
gallon pots now um and when I pot up to

486
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,798
those I will and I'm using the same soil

487
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:08,359
I started with I'm just adding to it so

488
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:09,918
then I will amend um like well I was

489
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,038
amending three tablespoons per gallon

490
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,000
but I think I'm dropping all my

491
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,078
amendments when I go back to re amend

492
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,359
I'm re amending at two tablespoons per

493
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:20,959
gallon instead of the three instead of

494
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:24,719
the three but I'll be using more 284

495
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,600
right I'll be using like 75% 80% you

496
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,519
know uh 284 and then I'll still be

497
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,519
throwing in a little 444 in the end I

498
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:34,759
think and then when I of course when I

499
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:36,480
do my I only do one I do two um top

500
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:38,640
dressings I do two top dressings see

501
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,919
this is what she does for me she's

502
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,679
awesome I I'll add two top dressings and

503
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:48,240
I add the first top dressing

504
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:49,880
um oh my goodness right before flip yeah

505
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,919
you add the top dressing and then a

506
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,600
couple few weeks after flip oh my

507
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,880
goodness gracious yeah I don't think I

508
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:58,119
do a top dressing in veg I just let it

509
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,440
go six weeks just in that soil and then

510
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,918
yeah I'll do and then up pot and good

511
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,640
and then in the third week this is how

512
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,200
easy it is and then in the third week of

513
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,559
of flower I think I do a top dressing

514
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,679
I'm done you know that's it's it

515
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,038
couldn't get any easier it just couldn't

516
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,240
get any easier and you know what this

517
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:16,919
last few grows I've experimented a

518
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,400
little bit with um you know with adding

519
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,720
things to the soil and feeding the soil

520
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,600
with such things as uh molasses molasses

521
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,200
um maybe making a few

522
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:29,719
teas Voodoo Juice we we go to that um

523
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,000
the store right the the um the organic

524
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,600
Mr Mr what's it called Mr fertilizer we

525
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,159
go to the store and they kind of go like

526
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,399
hey this and and we I can't take her I

527
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:40,320
can't take her there anymore because

528
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,280
she'll just buy everything rightone yeah

529
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,759
yeah we get this I'm I'm taking stuff

530
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:46,038
off shelf and I think I'm trying to I

531
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:47,679
think I'm actually at this point I'm not

532
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:50,158
allowed there anymore at this point my

533
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,798
girl I'm trying to establish a baseline

534
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:54,039
of how much do I really need to put in

535
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,639
the soil because I'm growing some really

536
00:18:54,038 --> 00:18:58,158
good stuff really the they're just

537
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,280
beautiful I'm I'm I'm growing what I

538
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:00,720
want to be growing

539
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,038
and we haven't talked about yields yet

540
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,200
because I'm I'm not I'm not using CO2 so

541
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:06,558
I'm not getting any stupid yields but

542
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,880
I'm getting I'm trying for fought

543
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,720
between five and six ounces of dense

544
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,640
we're not counting lar we're not

545
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,919
counting anything else between five and

546
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,280
six ounces if I get over 6 ounces I feel

547
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:18,960
like I've done it and 5 ounces I think

548
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,279
well you know your genetics are just not

549
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,880
going to some genetics are just going to

550
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:24,000
give you more than others but if I'm

551
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,240
getting 5 ounces I think I've done my

552
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,720
job with the with the with the girls and

553
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,120
I'm I'm like I said I'm getting a b

554
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,839
Baseline by not I'm not putting anything

555
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,719
in the soil I haven't for the last few

556
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:36,678
grows and I'm I'm really getting nothing

557
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,880
I'm not that's how easy it is yeah he

558
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,720
stop doing teas used used to do but I'm

559
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,480
thinking I will eventually once I've

560
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,079
really got a good Baseline of what my

561
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,519
Groves are I think I'll start maybe

562
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,558
feeding the soil and seeing if there's

563
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:50,240
any improvements with yield or quality

564
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:51,480
which you know this is kind of how and

565
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,079
and and I like to think that I'm

566
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,440
relating to a lot of um Growers out

567
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,918
there that are growing uh medicinal

568
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,679
plants one two three four of them you

569
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,080
know because not everybody's doing 12 15

570
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,440
20 plants or even 10 plants yeah our

571
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,279
limit is four in Canada yeah our limit

572
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,880
is four and of course I could go out

573
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:11,599
there and get a license for other you

574
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,679
know for for medicial I could go out and

575
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:16,158
get licens to probably grow

576
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,080
more I'm retired I'm not looking for

577
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:22,080
another job you know I'm really not I

578
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:23,839
mean what I do is um what I four is

579
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,720
enough no but what I do in the garden

580
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,519
but it enables me to spend I mean if you

581
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,880
have 12 kids are you going to give them

582
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,679
all what they need you're not you're

583
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,480
just I don't think you are if you have

584
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,798
four children and you spend so much time

585
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,480
down there with them they're getting

586
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:39,480
they're getting so much attention it's

587
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,360
really awesome and oh that is how you

588

came up with your your name grow Daddy

589
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:45,158

590
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,038
first started growing he'd come he'd

really good job of explaining really

611
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,278
nutrition what you're in your soil mix

612
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,360
you know you're in the 2/3 Prix third

613
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:38,038
worm castings with compost you got some

614
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:40,119
pearlite in there gu gree amendments you

615
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:41,960
cook for a month then you're up potting

616
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:43,519
you're adding more amendments uh I got

617
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,400
little notes Here cheating I'm not don't

618
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,079
have those memorized okay we did take

619
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,798
notes here but forgot a couple well I

620
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:50,519
forgot a couple things we I also I

621
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:52,440
started I put Dolomite lime in there I

622
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,000
had about a tablespoon and I didn't for

623
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,600
the seedlings but I got it before I do

624
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,919
this next upot I want to add some

625
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,000
Dolomite lime I don't even know what the

626
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:00,480
hell it does I just figure it won't hurt

627
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,440
you know and I'm putting a tablespoon in

628
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,880
it was good last time everything worked

629
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,200
last time I really want to stay to the

630
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,480
same thing I did last time except I want

631
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,038
to start decreasing my amendments a

632
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,720
little bit because I I just got a little

633
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,000
I got a little bit of tip bur I think

634
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,880
when I get that tip burn out of there

635
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
and let me another thing about with this

636
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,320
and going on is is is all these

637
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,079
additives um like cow mag and all this

638
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,960
different stuff

639
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:25,918
deficiencies I don't even know what a

640
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,798
deficiency is I don't see them I

641
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:31,240
absolutely don't see I don't never use

642
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:33,759
cow mag I never used so yeah whatever I

643
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,319
mean I see a lot of stuff whatever the

644
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:38,839
hell I'm doing it's called dummy growing

645
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:40,720
I have absolutely I've grown some ugly

646
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:42,439
plants let me tell you I I mean my first

647
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,038
few grows with too much light I mean I

648
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,679
have screwed up some plants but when you

649
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:47,759
start getting that light on there right

650
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,240
and you start giving them the right

651
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,278
amount of water you're not overwatering

652
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,640
or underwatering or stressing them out

653
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:56,319
and you're giving them the just putting

654
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,759
in some decent amendments like um I they

655
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,240
just don't ask for they just haven't

656
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:03,400
asked me for anything else they just

657
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,278
don't start crying for magnesium and the

658
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,759
calmag thing everyone's always talking

659
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:08,240
about calmag and we're kind of going

660
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:09,960
like I think that's a lot of synthetic

661
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,720
Growers mainly though I think I don't

662
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,880
know yeah you guys the organic route you

663
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,159
know with the guy are greeing it's

664
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,600
really a complete fertilizer right it's

665
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,039
a fertilizer blend with all natural

666
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:22,879
organic inputs and yeah that gets you

667
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,000
through the grow without having any cow

668
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,760
mag or any bottles really a lot of

669
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,119
people go that route and they're very

670
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:30,798
successful and the fact that you're in

671
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:32,599
you seven gallon containers a little bit

672
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,519
larger they'd often say with the organic

673
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:37,359
inputs larger the container the easier

674
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:39,400
it is to grow so oh I want to I would

675
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:42,719
like to I would like to grow in a 20

676
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,600
gallon I mean I mean I would really have

677
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,558
to do nothing I think I would start a 20

678
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:49,038
gallon and just and and water it once

679
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,639
every two weeks I don't know you just do

680
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,000
nothing so going to the S gallon for me

681
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,200
has been perfect because I'm not I don't

682
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,278
feel like I'm throwing away a lot of

683
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,120
soil at the end of a grow yet I feel

684
00:23:56,278 --> 00:24:03,720
like I'm able to keep my soil as wet or

685
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:06,079
as dry as I want it and um to stimulate

686
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,120
I guess the microbes and they will they

687
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,960
will Chomp down on the Amendments more

688
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:12,798
and give me and and make uh and just

689
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,640
make all the Amendments more more

690
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:19,400
accessible to the roots and bigger Roots

691
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,159
more Roots big fruits right as they say

692
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,120
absolutely and I don't even know you

693
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,480
know I hear a lot of things about all

694
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,319
this quantity coming out of a lot of

695
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,720
tents and I think that a lot of people

696
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,558
tune into that you know they hear a

697
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,720
pound or they hear two or three pounds

698
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:33,158
out of a 4x4 or they they hear these

699
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,600
really huge numbers coming out of these

700
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:38,919
tents and they want to grow that way and

701
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:42,278
uh as a beginner I'll first tell you

702
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:43,960
guys stop stop trying to do this you

703
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:46,038
know after you've after you've after

704
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,278
you've been around them for a few years

705
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:49,640
you know I think you can start adding

706
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:51,519
CO2 and get a handle on it but one of

707
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,720
the biggest and I have to yet but I also

708
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:54,759
have to say this one of the biggest I I

709
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,079
have to mention some of the biggest

710
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:58,839
things that have changed my growing and

711
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:02,319
one of them is listening to in the tent

712
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,639
I think it's in the tent um just simple

713
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:05,918
welcome to the grow tent some of the

714
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,000
stupidest things get mentioned that just

715
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,840
get in here and and I haven't seen one

716
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,519
of his videos in a while I really liked

717
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:15,199
him he's really by stupid he means

718
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:17,960
awesome yeah by stupid I mean awesome so

719
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,000
he's the only YouTuber I really heard

720
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,840
and still have ever heard talk besides

721
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,038
me because I mention it every show now

722
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:26,599
is how to read the leaves you know

723
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:27,839
nobody talks no nobody I'm not going to

724
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:28,839
do it here you going have to come to my

725
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,798
show to watch

726
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:34,278
but nobody talks about reading plants

727
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:35,679
and this is something that in my head if

728
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:37,200
I would have known in the beginning I

729
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,960
would have been able to I mean they talk

730
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,679
about okay they're getting white okay

731
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,600
but you've went past reading the plants

732
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:44,919
you're to the stage of burning them

733
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:47,038
seriously now they don't talk about just

734
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:48,880
reading the plants how they how they how

735
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:50,359
they raise up and prey if they're if if

736
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,679
they want more light or how they're kind

737
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:53,839
of leaning over a little bit if they

738
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,720
don't want Light reading the plants has

739
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,959
become so important to me in the grow

740
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,399
because it stopped me from doing a lot

741
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:03,840
of stuff with lights basically and I

742
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:05,839
think um that was huge oh and he mener

743
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,918
and and and why can't I think of his

744
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,599
name I don't know but I owe kudos to him

745
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,360
because he just he he talked about

746
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,519
reading the plant and I go reading the

747
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:16,759
leaves I didn't know that this is dumb

748
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:19,480
maybe maybe PE GT GT maybe they talk

749
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:20,879
about maybe they I just never heard this

750
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,000
so dummy me I've been through I don't

751
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,960
know how many grows and I'm looking at

752
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,558
my plants and I don't know what the hell

753
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,079
I'm looking at and he mentions leaves

754
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:29,558
and it was like an aha moment because

755
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:31,839
they they aha moment they pray when they

756
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:33,278
want more and they lie flat when they've

757
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:35,319
got enough so you won't see any burning

758
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:37,919
leaves in Myro they curl over like that

759
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:39,639
when they are getting burnt basically

760
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,320
yeah but well you you go on the forums

761
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,080
and what do you see put 2,000 Watts on

762
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:46,720
that put you know they're just having

763
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,558
you hammering you know and as a new

764
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,519
grower you hear that stuff and these

765
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:50,879
guys and if you're out there looking

766
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:52,879
like what light should I buy oh buy

767
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,520
something with 10,000 watts in it and

768
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,240
then turn Crank That Thing Up in there

769
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:58,240
and you're going to get some huge grows

770
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,480
and that's what I heard a lot of and if

771
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,240
if I didn't hear that that's what I

772
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,759
thought I was hearing and that's what I

773
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,359
tried to kind of emulate in the

774
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:08,558
beginning and I think GT just one dumb

775
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:11,439

much science to it which we need and I'm

792
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:47,200
all about science even though and I like

793
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:49,600
to say I'm I'm a science guy but I don't

794
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,159
understand it you know what I mean hey I

795

a lot of these guys a lot of these guys

799
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:03,558
are are scientists that are growing

800
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:05,599
right they're mixing all these chemicals

801
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:06,879
they're put bug well no I'm also talking

802

00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:13,960
know this much to this and they know the

806
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,480
PM so they they got a cut back on this

807
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,399
this was too much for me this was way

808
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,960
too much for my head too much work when

809
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,239
am I going to have time to golf I got to

810
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:26,360
I got to study this stuff you know so

811
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,798
growing in soil to me was just so easy

812
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:29,839
that's the best way to put it I just

813
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:31,918
love it and if I could tell any

814
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:33,398
beginner if I could tell and I know this

815
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,159
is probably a closing question but if I

816
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:36,558
could tell any beginner anything I'm

817
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,159
going to tell a beginner to grow start

818
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:40,240
in soil I'm just going to tell them to

819
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,240
start in soil it's just it's just a

820
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,480
no-brainer I'm dumb anybody else that's

821
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,240
just starting something it's got to be

822
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,839
feel a little dumb all right well I

823
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,519
appreciate your positive words about the

824
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,119
podcast that really does Give me fuel to

825
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,640
keep on going that's the whole reason

826
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:55,558
why I do is just try to spread

827
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,679
information good information and uh get

828
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:59,960
folks from all experience levels on the

829
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,600
podcast because I believe that even some

830
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,200
beginners there's takeaways for some

831
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:05,398
stuff you know even if you just even if

832
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,440
you're very experienced and you hear a

833
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:09,119
beginner talk you might hear something

834
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,399
that they say that kind of brings you

835
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,199
back like oh you know what I've been

836

people liking our show and that really

861
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:04,960

other things to do but she's kind of the

872
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,200
geek in our relationship she's kind of

873
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,919
geeky I'm kind of into it yeah so

874
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,519
anyways we do we do a lot of fun stuff

875
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:32,720
in a grow and you know what and just to

876
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:35,798
add to it this grow has helped us in

877
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,360
coming together is this not weird I mean

878
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:39,720
oh I'm not kidding because you know we

879
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:42,278
we lead separate lives in some ways you

880
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,759
know she's off on her computer doing her

881
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:47,038
geeky things and I'm out playing golf

882
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:49,319
and I'm you know we just but down in the

883
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,038
grow room we find each other when we do

884
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:53,119
a film day we do our filming on usually

885
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,200
Tuesdays and we do our film day we we

886
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:57,479
have to spend the whole day together you

887
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,480
know and it's a collab you don't even

888
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,720
know but we've had to learn to work

889
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,880
together because she's got to deal with

890
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,440
a diva and I've got to learn to deal

891
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:09,679
with I'm I'm learning to deal with a uh

892
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:12,159
I would have to say a a a a producer a

893
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,960
director and and uptight I might add a

894
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,080
little uptight little up call they call

895
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,960
it a predator you know like a producer

896
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,599
editor so I'm like you know like just

897
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,038
keep that shorter or whatever and you

898
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:24,678
know what she brings me around because

899
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:26,359
I'm like no no no no but you know I end

900
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:27,759
up I'm learning that if I just do it her

901
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:29,079
way it comes out pretty good and I just

902
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,200
got got to keep my mouth shut because

903
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:33,480
I'm I'm I'm an A personality so I like

904
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,120
to do things my way all the time and I I

905
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,919
just have to give away I just have to

906
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:39,319
give away oh managing sometimes that's

907
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:41,159
for the better right I do want to bring

908
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:43,240
it back and talk about you touched upon

909
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:44,519
a little bit about watering we covered

910
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,480
nutrition what you're using for

911
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:49,319
container size so on so forth but kind

912
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,038
of directly relating to that is watering

913
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:53,200
what's your water source and how do you

914
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:54,759
go about watering well my water source

915
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,519
is good here um I heard you mention you

916
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:59,038
got this pretty crappy water source

917
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:01,240
Where You Are we have tap water that

918
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,879
comes out I don't I think it's like 26

919
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,880
PPM something like that said 46 well I

920
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,399
think 26 I think it's like 26 though

921
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,440
it's 40 it's really not big of a

922
00:32:07,398 --> 00:32:13,199
difference so it comes out clean pretty

923
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,960
clean and I think on my first green on

924
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,840
my first grow I don't think I filtered

925
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,200
any of it or or I should say I didn't do

926
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:19,319
anything to it I just Ed it right out of

927
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,679
the tap you can look at those plants

928
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:23,240
they unbelievable now I didn't do a good

929
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,679
thing I could give them Justice after

930
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,919
that but that actually that was just

931
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,960
regular tap water now I find myself

932
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:33,880
using um what is that called that's

933
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:38,399
called uh acid what is it oh the uh uses

934
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:39,880
Vitamin C powder like abic acid so I use

935
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:41,038
that to take the chloramine we have

936
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,600
chloramines I use that to get the

937
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:44,480
chloramine out of the water I put a

938
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:46,719
little bit of that it also drops the PH

939
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,839
down a little bit um although the big

940
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,440
controversy now has been you know

941
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:52,359
doesn't make a difference what your pH

942
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,759
is right that's kind of the new

943
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:56,599
controversy and I don't know but I do

944
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:58,079
know that I I try to do what the

945
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:00,398
internet has kind of told me to do

946
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:03,439
YouTubers I try to keep it around

947
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:05,558
65 uh you know pH and I try to get it

948
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,840
down there somewhere but now I I almost

949
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:10,119
don't care but I do get I do I bought a

950
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:11,480
pH pin so I might as well use it you

951
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:13,638
know I spent some money on it so that's

952
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,558
about the only thing I use my pH pin for

953
00:33:13,638 --> 00:33:18,439
is adjusting my water and to be honest

954
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,240
with you if it's below seven and above

955
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,159
five I mean I really don't care but I

956
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,919
really I get it out of the tap I know

957
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,960
I'm long-winded here but I get it out of

958
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:30,320
the tab at probably a little above uh 8

959
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,600
five maybe going into eight I get it and

960
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,599
so I bring it down to under seven maybe

961
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:37,000
six and a half and then throw it in

962
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:40,038
there um I think you said talked about

963
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,079
also the watering habits that I have the

964
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:43,759
watering habits when I first started out

965
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:45,319
I was in five gallon three gallon I did

966
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:48,038
some experimenting with different Siz

967
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:49,879
pots and it was dryback for sure I don't

968
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:51,240
recommend doing those smaller pots

969
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,159
without doing it any other way is

970
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,120
dryback I have learned a little

971
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:57,440
something you know drying them back

972
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:59,558
doesn't mean drying them out completely

973
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,159
you know I don't think I really knew

974
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:03,638
that until I started with these bigger

975
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:05,320
pots and started and stressed out my I

976
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:07,000
think my first time I grew in those pots

977
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:09,918
I stressed I stressed my girls out a

978
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,159
little bit they gave me some seeds and I

979
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,638
I I only go back when I do do dryback on

980
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,159
my new pots my seven gallon pots I I

981
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,878
keep try to keep them wet most of the

982
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,320
time and I will do dryback on them I use

983
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:22,799
the blue mat moisture meter I really

984
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,760
recommend getting a moisture there's a

985
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,560
couple little things that I bought in

986
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,560
for my grow that I was really that I

987
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:29,199
think I waited to buy you know thinking

988
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:31,078
I could get by without them so there's I

989
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,439
don't like buying stuff and I don't like

990
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:35,039
putting extra there's so many gadgets

991
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,240
and gimmicks out there and different

992
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,480
stuff I I don't think I just dive in on

993
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,239
anything I think I I really take my time

994
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,280
in getting there and and you're the

995
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:45,878
reason why I bought bought my blue map

996
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,159
by the way I was watching a podcast

997
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:49,598
where you were talking about the blue

998
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,800
mat moisture meter you didn't have one

999
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,559
yet yeah you didn't have one yet but you

1000
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,399
were talking about buying one and then

1001
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:58,519
of course I got to have what Mr Grow has

1002
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,039
you know so you know not only that but

1003
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:01,960
I'm so I wanted to get them so I I

1004
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:04,759
bought one and then I discovered when I

1005
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:07,199
bought it that you know big old huge big

1006
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,079
old huge carrot oh my goodness he's like

1007
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:10,519
it's so big I expected to have something

1008
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:12,119
I was going to be putting in each bag

1009
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:14,119
and and checking the soil on of course

1010
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:15,960
so in for a penny in for a pound give me

1011
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:17,800
another three of those because now I got

1012
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,639
to get you know to my other containers

1013
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,280
they're expensive so I find myself

1014
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:25,279
drying out my container when I'm doing

1015
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,800
dryback on them to uh about 25% you know

1016
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,079
I leave about 20 25% of water in there

1017
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,119
when I do a dryback and that's a good

1018
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:33,119
dryback and that's how I we were talking

1019
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,079
about uh what is it IPM or PM or

1020
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:39,880
whatever it called PPM p no no no um uh

1021
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:41,640
you know Pest Management pest yeah and

1022
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,480
the only pests I've ever had in my grow

1023
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:45,920
really are uh gats and you know we've

1024
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,719
had we've had a few seasons where it was

1025
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:53,720
a big joke because I thought I handled

1026
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:56,399
it with mosquito dumps and lo and behold

1027
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:58,519
it was just a dryback that got rid of my

1028
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,599
yeah it was so so the next season so

1029
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:03,159
here I have this big old huge tray of

1030
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:05,119
these dunks and I'm going dunks I'm

1031
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:08,000
going to tell the world I'm just going

1032
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,519
to tell the world how I how I fix gats

1033
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,440
in your tent I I'm going to tell the

1034
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:13,599
world how you do this and just it's just

1035
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,000
through these mosquito Dums you know and

1036
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,318
I soaked them for a long period of time

1037
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,079
so I got the ppms way up on these on the

1038
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:22,199
mixtures of these things and I went I I

1039
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,680
I one of my girls suffered okay because

1040
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:25,318
I I I don't think I I think they were

1041
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:28,358
drinking it they they absolutely wasn't

1042
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:29,440
killing a gat and I used it

1043
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:31,679
I used it from the time they were

1044
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,679
ceilings basically because I brought

1045
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:37,639
gats in as stupid as that sound because

1046
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:41,199
I wanted to show how easy it is to get

1047
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:42,799
rid of the Nets so easy right so I stun

1048
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,399
so I stuned this is what you can't do

1049
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,599
when you're only going four plants right

1050
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,960
but you're also trying to create content

1051
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,640
right well I'm trying to create some

1052
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,440
content but not ruin my grow I'm so

1053
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:55,078
important to me to get my my yield and

1054
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,920
my my growth so I stunted one of my

1055
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,070
girls doing this she had the gats they

1056
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,200
were flying every

1057
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:02,119
[Music]

1058
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:04,679
just it was Lily yeah I'm sorry I went

1059
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:06,480
off I went off on a rant and oh so

1060
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:09,279
anyway so going back to watering how I

1061
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,039
water so in watering so anyways I like

1062
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,440
that seven gallons for growing

1063
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:14,318
organically and being able to put a

1064
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,639
moisture meter in there some kind I

1065
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:18,279
don't necessarily you know the blue

1066
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:19,559
mat's working great for me uh um it does

1067
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,880
it works excellent but I know there's

1068
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:24,719
other moisture meters out there that

1069
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,240
work just as well if not better um yeah

1070
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:28,358
it's it's better to keep all those

1071
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:30,078
little microbes in the soil soil active

1072
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:32,239
using you know keeping it moist all the

1073
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,119
time and I got really into the microbes

1074
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:36,879
I I like the you know I made made

1075
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,640
microbe TV cuz it's really cool to look

1076
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,440
at that stuff under a microscope there's

1077
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:43,078
a lot going on I would have to say I

1078
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,880
keep I try to keep my pot moist when I

1079
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:47,720
get them in the s g now I'm driving I'm

1080
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,920
I'm doing dryback in the seedlings stage

1081
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:52,559
all the way from the solo 1.5 I'm doing

1082
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,599
dryback when I get into the 7even gallon

1083
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:59,799
pot I like to keep the moisture um at

1084
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,440
about 75% so water to 75% and then the

1085
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,599
next day I come in and you know if

1086
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,400
they're if they're drinking water it's

1087
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:07,000
going down to 50% so I'm adding 25%

1088
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,318
keeping it but and that's about with the

1089
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,358
blue mat moisture meter that's what

1090
00:38:08,318 --> 00:38:12,039
enables me to do and when I see a na

1091
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:13,358
problem now I know how to get rid of

1092
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:15,599
them by the way if I didn't mention do

1093
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:17,920
mosquito I must have used 20 of them

1094
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,280
that season 30 of those things they just

1095
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,480
don't work I tried them every which way

1096
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,400
forget about forget about those I've

1097
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,838
conclusively proven those things do not

1098
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,119
do squat but dryback will take away your

1099
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:29,599
gats

1100
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,440
almost immediately well they they take

1101
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,359
two weeks to die so I've done my

1102
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,200
studying you kind of do some bottom

1103
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:36,799
watering while you I do all kinds of

1104
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,159
dumb stuff I do all kinds of dumb stuff

1105
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,960
because I have a moisture meter and I'm

1106
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:41,000
able to and that's what makes me be able

1107
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,720
to do it because I can put a moisture

1108
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,119
meter in there and go okay I'm down to

1109
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:48,000
25% I don't see I see some flying around

1110
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:49,440
so I'll just bottom water them for a

1111
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,079
couple weeks right so I'll just hit them

1112
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,760
on the bottom and get them back up there

1113
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:55,119
and and and make sure the soil on the

1114
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,720
top the first couple inches doesn't

1115
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,119
really have a chance to really get wet

1116
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:01,480
again so I'll dry out for this top of it

1117
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,838
for um a couple weeks and when I don't

1118
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,400
see anything flying around in there I

1119
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:08,159
know it's safe again to get my 75% water

1120
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,639
back in those pots and I

1121
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:11,879
feel I feel like this has been just

1122
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,920
worked out really good for getting rid

1123
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,079
of NS and not stressing out my plants at

1124
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,838
all they just don't they don't suffer at

1125
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,039
all I get rid of the gats this has just

1126
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:23,440
been the best thing the best way for me

1127
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:26,159
to to do it it's just been awesome yeah

1128
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,358
yeah moisture level in the medium is so

1129
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,159
important when it comes to Quality

1130
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:30,400
quality and yield right if you have too

1131
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:31,480
much moisture in the medium you're going

1132
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,920
to stunt your growth and you're going to

1133
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:36,760
hurt your yield right too dry same thing

1134
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,318
you lack of access to that nutrition

1135
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,599
right that's pretty cool that you

1136
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:41,759
actually are using the blue matte

1137
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,039
moisture meter CU I'm using it as well

1138
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,680
and just to dive a little bit deeper

1139
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:49,039
into that it has a millibar reading on

1140
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:51,440
it and I think blat recommends correct

1141
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:53,519
me if I'm wrong was it a 50 to 100 mbar

1142
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,280
in order to have that's like their

1143
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,960
optimal moisture level now some people

1144
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,800
will dial it in to 80 or 100 I think

1145
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,000
it's the higher it goes the more drier

1146
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:06,119
it is right yeah and I will basically

1147
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,838
when I water it um I will water it it

1148
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:09,640
says saturated but I know what's in the

1149
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:12,199
soil because same those seven gallon

1150
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:15,039
pots they take approximately two gallons

1151
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:16,239
of water eight quarts eight liters

1152
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:18,159
whichever way you want to look at it

1153
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:20,078
that's saturated to that's saturated so

1154
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,920
I know I know if I dry those things out

1155
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,680
I mean completely because I did that to

1156
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,119
grow before I completely I mean until

1157
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:26,719
they were until until my plants were

1158
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,318
drooping dried it out completely the

1159
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:31,838
sgon pot but they will literally take

1160
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:35,679
two gallons about to to to to make it

1161
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:37,599
right and well when I do a full watering

1162
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:38,879
on my plant I'm draw let me try to get

1163
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,680
this my head straight wrapped around

1164
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,800
this when I do a full watering um from

1165
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:46,838
dryback now it's when I when I do

1166
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,359
dryback on those I'm to get them

1167
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:50,838
completely saturated where I have any

1168
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:52,838
runoff I'm only adding six quarts right

1169
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:54,679
so you know there's there's 20% so I'm

1170
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:56,880
not going completely down on and it's

1171
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:59,759
absolutely important like you said and I

1172
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,920
have no noticed through veg and through

1173
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,880
veg that's when you notice all the

1174
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:06,280
growth keeping those keeping those girls

1175
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,480
wet has has just stimulated the growth

1176
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,040
so much on those and and and like I said

1177
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,079
it's it's it's it's helping the microbes

1178
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:13,838
they're not going into a dormant State

1179
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,920
anymore so they've got that you know

1180
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:17,799
before when you're doing dryback and I

1181
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,159
dryback is great and there's a lot of

1182
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,119
people that have been growing for 30 40

1183
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:23,318
years doing dryback and um it works for

1184
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:24,960
them and they're growing with smaller

1185
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:27,440
containers and probably using synthetics

1186
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,519
and quite honestly and probably you know

1187
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,639
running off on it and doing other things

1188
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:34,280
we're organic we just let that pot soak

1189
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:36,078
it right back up I'm not measuring ppms

1190
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,200
coming out at the bottom I mean then

1191
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:41,720
once I water it completely and saturate

1192
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:43,318
it of course the next day from watering

1193
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:46,159
the seven gallon it's still going to

1194
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:49,000
show saturated it's going to be only at

1195
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:50,719
yeah it's going to be probably 50 U mlib

1196
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,400
bars even the next day after saturating

1197
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:55,199
so it takes two days to bring it back to

1198
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,079
that 75 you know that 75 or even to the

1199
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,358
50 where you want to water it because

1200
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:00,240
when when it gets down for me when I

1201
00:41:58,358 --> 00:42:04,519
come into the grow room and see it

1202
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:06,519
really 120 if it's 120 mbars I'm kind of

1203
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:08,559
looking at it like oh my goodness it's

1204
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:11,318
not it doesn't if it needs to be watered

1205
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:12,960
it's only like one quart so usually when

1206
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:15,079
watering is really going for me in the

1207
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,240
grow it's a couple quarts a day in each

1208
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:20,119
of those bags and so when I come in the

1209
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,919
the mle bar will go from saturated the

1210
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:27,200
day before because I put 75 filled it up

1211
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:31,039
75% it will go to um somewhere between

1212
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:33,000
usually around 180 to 300 you know

1213
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:36,199
depending to 300 and that doesn't

1214
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,599
necessarily mean it is drinking more ah

1215
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:39,199
I just keep such a good chart of

1216
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,559
drinking and I've really learned how to

1217
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:44,239
water and some girls when they're

1218
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:46,119
drinking more it's and it says 300 it

1219
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:49,558
only wants a

1220
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:52,599
couple a couple what would you call a

1221
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:55,680
liter like a couple what is that t yeah

1222
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:58,480
but not a whole liter just a couple

1223
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:00,279
ounces ounces yeah like a couple ounces

1224
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,119
above it doesn't need that much it's

1225
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,680
just been like I said when you do use

1226
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:07,039
one of these meters it's like it's like

1227
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:09,078
you know your children do you know what

1228
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:10,920
I mean you know you know your children

1229
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:12,720
you know you're just so dialed in even

1230
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,680
if you're reading the and it's giving

1231
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:16,078
you an idea and then you look on what

1232
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:17,919
what you watered it at when it was at

1233
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,559
300 mbars to bring it where you want it

1234
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,639
what you watered it when it was at 200 M

1235
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:25,359
Bar you you keep some notes we do have

1236
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:27,400
7-Day uh average now like he's been he

1237
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:30,159
he actually keeps track of how much

1238
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,280
water he puts in every day and what the

1239
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:35,279
milar has said and we do kind of we keep

1240
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,359
a spreadsheet actually and so we we kind

1241
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,760
of we started doing this last grow with

1242
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:42,239
the moisture meter we started doing a

1243
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,599
7-Day average for each plant and and

1244
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:45,399
that's another thing I probably suggest

1245
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,880
to anybody is write stuff down I mean

1246
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,559
that's been the best thing for us and

1247
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,160
and and actually we hey if you we have a

1248
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:54,079
spreadsheet that we do on our show and

1249
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:56,318
I'm proud to do it because we're so what

1250
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,839
would you we're so I want to say trans

1251
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:01,279
uh transparent we're so transparent on

1252
00:43:58,838 --> 00:44:04,838
our grow we want to be because we want

1253
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,599
people we want to help um new Growers

1254
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:08,078
and and maybe give a few ideas to a

1255
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:09,640
couple old Growers I guess you know on

1256
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,280
different styles or different growing

1257
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:14,239
but we really want to help I think I

1258
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,079
think I want to I want to help me when I

1259
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:19,078
first started growing and that's who I'm

1260
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,640
really talking to every week on our

1261
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:23,839
podcast is I'm talking to me and when I

1262
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:26,118
was looking on YouTube and different

1263
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:28,599
forums I would find some bits and bits

1264
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:30,720
and bits and bids it wasn't described

1265
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:33,880
well enough for me it wasn't because I'm

1266
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:35,480
dumb I need everything step by step and

1267
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,440
I I just feel like it's missing

1268
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,119
something it's just I mean Mr kuk get

1269
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,159
the hell out of here he's the biggest

1270
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:44,720
guy on YouTube he don't even have to do

1271
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:46,759
videos every six months I mean he's huge

1272
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:49,279
that's who I found first that's who I

1273
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,720
found first because I remember I started

1274
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,680
I started looking when I started growing

1275
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:54,759
with guag green after my first first or

1276

1279
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,838
got know how to use his stuff so I

1280
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:03,838
looked up his show and I remember

1281
00:45:00,838 --> 00:45:06,119
looking up his show he just I love his

1282
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:08,639
videos I love his editing you know I

1283
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:10,640
love everything about his grow the only

1284
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:13,799
thing I don't love about him is the

1285
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:15,558
magic there's magic in his there's magic

1286
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,359
I'm not getting there's something he's

1287
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:19,200
missing things he's I don't know what

1288
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:20,838
he's missing but he's missing things and

1289
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:23,199
there's a lot of magic and I didn't want

1290
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:25,400
to be that YouTuber that didn't let

1291
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:27,919
everybody know every single detail so we

1292
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,079
do a spreadsheet and you can find it in

1293
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,200
our in our description and it's and it's

1294
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,039
it's it's watering It's Kind it's yeah

1295
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:35,960
and it's kind of cool it's sort of for

1296
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:39,719
us it helps us because it kind of gives

1297
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:43,199
a timeline you know for like okay so for

1298
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:45,039
up potting for what what week of uh veg

1299
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,000
we're in or whatever it kind of gives us

1300
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,440
a timeline oh these ones these plants

1301
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,480
are doing a little better than last

1302
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,358
season or o these ones are slower and we

1303
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,159
can kind of see from the what day we're

1304
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:57,598
on what day of the grow how the plants

1305
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:59,799
look very detailed though and only know

1306
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,880
not only helps people that are interest

1307
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,599
excuse

1308
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,480
me that not only helps people that are

1309
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,519
interested in what I'm doing and want to

1310
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:10,199
know exactly what I'm I mean exactly I

1311
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:12,759
can't tell you how much that means to me

1312
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:15,838
because like I said I I just if I don't

1313
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:18,240
have exact then I'm now I am just trying

1314
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,519
to go off of what Dum Dums might do you

1315
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:21,799
know I'm trying to have

1316
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:23,280
exacts exactly what people are doing and

1317
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:26,079
he's got plenty of competition in the

1318
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,960
Dum Dum uh Arena here because I have

1319
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,440
always had the black thumb of death in

1320
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,119
the garden basically and I've learned a

1321
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,800
lot you know about all the things that

1322
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:35,440
I've been doing wrong all my life with

1323
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,640
my plants killing but I have I have

1324
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,079
found our spreadsheets in which I didn't

1325
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:40,879
know because we were never detailing

1326
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:44,000
everything so much but I have found my

1327
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,160
spreadsheets invaluable for my own

1328
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,838
growing of what I did what weak things

1329
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:49,759
happened where things were at and of

1330
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,480
course we do the video so now we can

1331
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,559
actually see the plants at where they

1332
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:57,159
were on this day which you know it's

1333
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:59,079
just huge so us doing the uh the whole

1334
00:46:57,159 --> 00:47:01,159
thing has just been good for us and

1335
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:03,318
hopefully good for people that um would

1336
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:05,558
like to have you know some some good

1337
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:07,358
medicine you know and and and a lot of

1338
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:08,800
it like I said we're grow for yield and

1339
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:10,400
we're going to go back to Kyle kushman

1340
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,640
we were talking about growing for yield

1341
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,400
and that's where he taught me and I

1342
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:16,400
don't think we we we sketched on it but

1343
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:18,079
what he taught me was about you know

1344
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,200
about lollipopping and he talked he

1345
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,079
mentioned some different things on the

1346
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:22,439
show the other day you know but I was

1347
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:23,880
probably watching something old that he

1348
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,880
did and we all just kind of you know

1349
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,838
move around and change things as we as

1350
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,838
we go through life but I I've been

1351
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:31,679
following what he taught me when I first

1352
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:33,039
looked at this video five years ago and

1353
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:35,000
it was

1354
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:36,838
basically yeah let me take a breath and

1355
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,039
stop talking for one second let me see

1356
00:47:36,838 --> 00:47:40,838
here but plan training I'm glad you're

1357
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:43,318
transitioning to that because uh that's

1358
00:47:40,838 --> 00:47:44,719
kind of where I wanted to go next is

1359
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:47,358
what do you do for plan training in

1360
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:50,199
order to achieve high quality in order

1361
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:52,318
to get a higher yield yeah go for it

1362
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:53,960
hopefully you cut your breath by now I

1363
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:56,920
would have to say I would have to say I

1364
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,679
first started on uh forums and different

1365
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,280
things and looking at different plants

1366
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:03,039
and looking to see what I liked and I

1367
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,880
just for some reason I love to see the

1368
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,358
canopy you know I just love to see that

1369
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,960
level canopy and I think what sticks in

1370
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:12,639
my head and I know it's iconic where you

1371
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:15,199
see the picture of the outdoor medicial

1372
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,279
plant and it's a hedge you know you have

1373
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:17,439
to have seen it I've seen a million

1374
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,280
pictures different pictures of people

1375
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,679
growing Hedges and stuff and I thought

1376
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,760
to myself God that looks so cool that

1377
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:26,598
looks so cool I want to grow that way

1378
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,720
and then of course the common sense of

1379
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:31,000
it of getting everything to the top you

1380
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:32,759
know and finding out that the par is the

1381
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,039
par is the same they're all getting the

1382
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,359
the same thing so you can get all these

1383
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:38,318
colas all these tops all to the top

1384
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:41,078
getting the exact same thing nobody's

1385
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:42,800
being treated special and it's kind of a

1386
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:44,318
way of bonsing which you guys talked a

1387
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,039
little bit about the other day with Kyle

1388
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:48,440
kushman which I thought was kind of cool

1389
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:50,759
the Bonsai I mean I love the Bonsai I

1390
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:53,039
love all the cool stuff I see in that

1391
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:56,480
people have time for I'm I'm too busy

1392
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:58,759
playing golf but love looking at it I

1393
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,199
love the art because it's and so this is

1394
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:03,240
kind of my art as well being able to get

1395
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:05,078
the flattest canop I don't always I'm

1396
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:06,318
not always able to achieve it and I'm

1397
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:10,039
not always able to make it look as

1398
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:13,279
perfect as sedna last EP last season I

1399
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:15,400
sedna was just amazing she just gave me

1400
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,240
this flat beautiful looking C which for

1401
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,798
me yeah and they're all not all like

1402
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:20,279
that but I'm striving for that and that

1403
00:49:18,798 --> 00:49:23,039
gets everything to the top and Kyle

1404
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,880
kushman of course helped me in this way

1405
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:27,798
of trimming taking off all the nodes all

1406
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:29,920
the way up to the top

1407
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:32,519
and you know taking off all those bottom

1408
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,200
noes and and the video that I watched

1409
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:37,400
and I've rewatched it he says all the

1410
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:40,118
way to the top all the way to the top

1411
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,680
you got to have some big kahunas you

1412
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:44,680
gotta have huge kahunas to take all

1413
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:46,199
those noes to the top right you you

1414
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:47,558
think of it like you got to have faith

1415
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:49,519
you got to have some Faith there you got

1416
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:52,839
to have some I want to say you have to

1417
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:54,400
have almost religion to do that and it

1418
00:49:52,838 --> 00:49:56,119
helped me because when I grew my first

1419
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,960
crop I think I was a little dumb about

1420
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:59,960
it all Kyle kushman says to do it and I

1421
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,519
did it right and then I ended up getting

1422
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,639
some growth I didn't clean it off like I

1423
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:05,480
clean my new ones off now so you see on

1424
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:08,039
my new on on my first grow you see stuff

1425
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,400
going down but he had everything going

1426
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:12,798
up to the top so now I use some common

1427
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,519
sense depending on how far how far they

1428
00:50:12,798 --> 00:50:16,119
are spaced on the nodes if there's some

1429
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:17,759
Far spacing I don't want to grow

1430
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:20,680
anything that's not going to

1431
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,880
connect and I'm trying to connect I want

1432
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:24,279
everything to not only connect I I

1433
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,240
almost when I get to the when I get to

1434
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:28,319
the stage of triming everything I think

1435
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:30,959
I don't want to be peeling off things

1436
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:31,880
that aren't you know tight you know and

1437
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,960
that's how you do it you know how you're

1438
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,519
peeling off lower lower buds um because

1439
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,559
they're not quite connected but they're

1440
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:39,199
they're still hard and they're still

1441
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:40,839
good they're up on the top so I'm trying

1442
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:42,719
to get all those hard ones as much as I

1443
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:44,599
can that are going to connect up on top

1444
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:46,558
I use some common sense like some plants

1445
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:48,680
I will take all the way up to the top

1446
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,798
because I feel you bring the energy and

1447
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:52,440
Kyle kushman said it best you taking all

1448
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:54,280
that energy from the bottom you bring it

1449
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,639
up to the top you're giving those top

1450
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:59,319
all the good stuff and you know they

1451
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:03,239
they end up growing but I have also

1452
00:50:59,318 --> 00:51:06,480
found they I I also found that I'm and I

1453
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:10,039
have a goal of getting 50 buds in a 2 by

1454
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:13,079
two space Oh Bud site of Bud sites was a

1455
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:16,480
huge thing for us we we uh we thought we

1456
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:18,720
we had too many at 50 but now I made a

1457
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,639
mistake I made a mistake on on one of my

1458
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:23,239
Grows Where I grow I grew um you know I

1459
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:24,639
just did a lot of just pinching

1460
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:26,759
everything I'm just pinching small small

1461
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:28,279
Bud syndrome yeah we call it small small

1462
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,520
Bud syndrome we have the whole thing on

1463
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,400
that because I had small Bud syndrome

1464
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:33,199
That season and it ended up everything

1465
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,680
everything got about I got about 5

1466
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:37,199
ounces of plant and there were just

1467
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:39,759
little tiny plants you know because I uh

1468
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:42,318
I pinched a lot of stuff and then I went

1469
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:45,160
into transition too soon so nothing took

1470
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:47,039
off nothing nothing nothing so they all

1471
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:49,159
it just stayed like a little like a

1472
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:50,318
little you know like a little Dome you

1473
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:51,838
know these flowers were just like a

1474
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:54,679
little D everything was really tight and

1475
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:57,039
there was 50 Bud sits on each of these

1476
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:59,639
on each of these plants and they were

1477
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:01,358
all really small and but but because it

1478
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:02,838
was so small I did pinch them I pinched

1479
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:04,639
every one of these plants all the way to

1480
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:06,318
the top and they got all these nice

1481
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:07,519
little Tops on them and I was just I

1482
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:09,480
went through the whole season going man

1483
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:10,960
I really I really messed up the yield on

1484
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,480
this you know I really messed up the

1485
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:16,000
yield but we actually were we were we

1486
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,920
were we were pretty pretty besides

1487
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,838
besides we had a stunted run I think

1488
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,000
that was Lily that that seeing we name

1489
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:24,000
our plants so I think that was Lily that

1490
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,639
grow was stunted because of the gats so

1491
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,119
we only got three plants that we really

1492
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:28,879
but Lily looked great but she ended up

1493
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,880
just completely being lar you know she

1494
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,559
actually came out we think the the gats

1495
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,760
got to her well they did they did she

1496
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:37,000
was obviously stented but we thought she

1497
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,920
she grew some really nice looking you

1498
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,440
know uh flowers and we thought she the

1499
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,318
huge in fact and I thought they were

1500
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,200
going to be really really nice and when

1501
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:46,558
they dried out they were just just they

1502
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:48,399
were just fluff so I just we I I take

1503
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,720
that myself it wasn't the seeds it

1504
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:54,358
wasn't the genetics it was me and my in

1505
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:57,399
my grow but nevertheless now we grow and

1506
00:52:54,358 --> 00:52:59,358
I really let everything veg out um um uh

1507
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:02,318
last last season everything vegged out

1508
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:03,719
to six weeks and I think one tent I

1509
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:04,759
would have wenton another week I think I

1510
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:06,919
grew a tent that I would have won

1511
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,359
another weekend but the other tent was

1512
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,838
so it was just it was just going wild

1513
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:12,279
after six weeks I just couldn't hold

1514
00:53:10,838 --> 00:53:14,039
that one back and I really like to

1515
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,640
flower everything at the same time and

1516
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:17,639
go into the whole grow at the same time

1517
00:53:15,639 --> 00:53:21,239
so I had to flower the other tent and so

1518
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:24,960
I did I'm sorry where was I training I

1519
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:27,039
was TR I'm so sorry I warned you yeah

1520
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,920
yeah so anyway so

1521
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:33,199
um anyway so we I think I want to just

1522
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,798
finish this by saying we try to veg them

1523
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:37,159
out and really let them grow out to

1524
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:40,119
their 2 by two their two by they each

1525
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:41,679
get a 2 by two spot and my 2x4 grows so

1526
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:43,559
that's four of them each of them get a 2

1527
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:46,879
by two spot we try to really let them

1528
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:47,920
veg out six maybe seven weeks uh where

1529
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,680
they're looking like they're taking up

1530
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,680
the tent then we then we then we flip

1531
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:55,358
them and we let them grow up and uh

1532
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:58,919
we're we're I pinch like I pinch like

1533
00:53:55,358 --> 00:54:01,119
nobody else I I got I I just pinch and I

1534
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,400
I figure I got I think I got about two

1535
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:05,119
pinches besides the top the the first

1536
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,760
top I think I got about two pinches

1537
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,480
after that and we just try to let the

1538
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,799
plant do what it's going to do come up

1539
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,440
and try to and try try to try to use

1540
00:54:11,798 --> 00:54:15,318
some common sense on the top if the

1541
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,079
nodes are close enough that's kind of

1542
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:18,440
where we keep it to is we want those we

1543
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:19,798
want those to connect if they don't we

1544
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,000
just go to the top everything's going to

1545
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:24,719
go to the top we're going to get

1546
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,440
hopefully six [ __ ] we're yeah I get

1547
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:27,959
cocky hopefully six ounces on every

1548
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,119
plant but I'll tell you what if we get

1549
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,599
five we feel pretty pretty good if it's

1550
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:34,039
all dense we feel pretty good with 5

1551
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:36,838
ounces on a plant not using

1552
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:38,639
any anything so that's I think I and try

1553
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:39,318
to get that flat canopy so I use a lot

1554
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:41,480
of

1555
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:43,119
wire you just got to come see it's just

1556
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,358
it's just fun I mean there's almost no

1557
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,440
way to describe it you almost have to do

1558
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:50,119
it he really enjoys the the um like the

1559
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:53,079
the bonsing of it all like the pinching

1560
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:55,960
and the defol the tucking and the taking

1561
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:58,318
care and like he'll go come look at this

1562
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,000
canop it's this is my favorite time in

1563
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:01,639
the grow is when I get to do all this

1564
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,159
manipulating of it I mean really when

1565
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:04,838
they're when they're like right now

1566
00:55:03,159 --> 00:55:06,480
they're just they're in Solo cups about

1567
00:55:04,838 --> 00:55:07,880
ready to be up potted but what do you do

1568
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:11,240
you just go down there and I watered

1569
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,480
them twice they're so boring and then

1570
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:14,719
and then they're going to go into the

1571
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,159
1.5s again you do Dy back on them but

1572
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:17,439
I'm starting to when they get in the

1573
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:19,639
next one I'm going to start bending them

1574
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,838
over and start training them immediately

1575
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:22,000
when they get in those things I'll start

1576
00:55:20,838 --> 00:55:23,440
the training and that's when it starts

1577
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,159
getting fun for me but when they get

1578
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,280
bigger and I have to spend more time

1579
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:28,679
down there I start talking to my girls I

1580
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,880
have a good time down there throwing a

1581
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:33,399
podcast me and the girls have a good

1582
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:37,358
time I absolutely by the end of this

1583
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:39,079
grow I'm in love with four new girls

1584
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:40,679
it's true you don't mind do you I don't

1585
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:42,359
okay I'm absolutely in love with them

1586
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:44,798
because we we go through and we talk

1587
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:46,279
about them and for us they're almost

1588
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:47,838
they really are our little children

1589
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:50,280
they're kind of immortalized I think

1590
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:52,558
that's one I don't know if anybody loves

1591

1592

love our girls every season theme so

1593
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,480
it's heartbreaking

1594
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:02,200
at the end when you got to chop him down

1595
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:04,838

1596
00:56:02,199 --> 00:56:07,000
now and when I and when I do when I do

1597
00:56:04,838 --> 00:56:09,159
give away my girls um because I do I

1598
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,760

1600
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:15,799

1606
00:56:24,358 --> 00:56:28,119
them what it is I I tell them the girls

1607
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:31,000

1608
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:32,240
me that's who these girls are and this

1609
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,559
this season you guys we're going to let

1610
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:36,399
you in on something if you've seen a

1611
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:38,559
couple episodes we got girls we got

1612
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,119
girls we got we've girls are going to be

1613
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:43,640
talking to me this season and that's

1614
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:45,280
what I can't wait for yeah because I I

1615
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:46,719
go out and have a conversation but and I

1616
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,880
can hear them but nobody else can but

1617
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:51,358
Mrs graddy she has given them all voices

1618
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:54,798
this yeah we did some I don't know if

1619
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:57,598
you we did some AI um generated

1620
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:59,480
characters you know like that it's our

1621
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,160
idea of fun and we're always looking to

1622
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:03,000
we're always looking to entertain as

1623
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:04,480
well as maybe help people grow and

1624
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,199
that's the fun of our show and I think

1625
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:09,400
that's really that's that's it this is

1626
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:11,159
and and to be quite honest I don't think

1627
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,798
if we were doing if we were if we were

1628
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:15,118
doing this kind of content we would

1629
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:16,798
really keep doing it um I think we're

1630
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,559
doing it because we really enjoy doing

1631
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:20,960
it from each of our aspects I'm kind of

1632
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:24,039
the grower Ali's

1633
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,519

1634
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:27,359
