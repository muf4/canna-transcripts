1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,639
coming up on garden talk if it keeps

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,318
raining and you're like damn i gotta

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,000
water in my liquid nutrients i got to

4
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:10,080
get nutrition in there that could be a

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,240
conundrum because your plant's wet

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,320
already and that's why it's good to

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,560
cover yourself with well it's been

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,039
raining but i did have some top dress

9
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,799
thinning outside thinning your plants

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,560
out when you're out there scouting for

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,160
pests you're not going crazy through

12
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,759
like you got to thin it out a little for

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,719
air movement and not creating

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,560
microclimates uh for pests microbes man

15
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,919
game changer for the grow you can do a

16
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,600
lot better and don't think it's a

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,440
misconception i used to think this as

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,120
well like oh i'm using synthetic

19
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,479
nutrients or salt-based nutrients or

20
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,558
this it's just it's not going to work

21
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,959
well the microbes they can work together

22
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,519
for sure in your grow media grow your

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,079
plants as happy and healthy as possible

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,079
and that helps a ton with pests a plant

25
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,840
that's ailing or showing signs like the

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,600
pests know they'll come to that they'll

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,600
have an easier chance of taking it out

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,439

kind of how you got into gardening hmm

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,199
gardening

121
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,879
i don't know first came to me is

122
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,240
i want to say challenges but sometimes i

123
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,240
thought i could do things better with

124
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,160
plants i mean the very way back in the

125
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,840
day would be my dad had tropical plants

126
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,520
in the house and when you have tropical

127
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,478
plants in the house so

128
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,758
my my first plant was a tropical plant

129
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,079
in my bedroom i'm like we got to get

130
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,639
some ambiance in here you know just a

131
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,240
little bit of uh make this nice and then

132
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,560
the lead from there

133
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,319
to really i've always liked hot stuff

134
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,839
hot sauce me and my brother would

135
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,800
challenge each other with who could eat

136
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,399
the hot jalapenos out of the jar

137
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,918
and then i was like dude i can probably

138
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,439
just grow some habaneros and that turned

139
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,758
into just messing with people right

140
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:08,240
drying them making hot powders habanero

141
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,680
pepper eating challenges

142
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,400
and then i guess finally just getting

143
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,800
into

144
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,879
yeah the value of medicinal plants um

145
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,520
was what really when i started to grow

146
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,839
indoors um and then recently not

147
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,758
recently but later in my growing career

148
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:24,079
had the opportunity in colorado to get

149
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,000
some grows under my belt outdoors i'm

150
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,839
just on the backyard level you know for

151
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,478
you know medicinal garden for myself but

152
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:33,038
that's it in a nutshell nice i have yet

153
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,959
to grow peppers i actually planted a

154
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,120
couple pepper seeds actually i have the

155
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:40,799
seeds right here they're uh bullnose

156
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,639
pepper from baker creek so um

157
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,319
i planted like four of them and they

158
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,759
didn't sprout so i gotta give another

159
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,279
shot one thing that was really cool

160
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,800
about peppers that i found out is like

161
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,319
you can grow them in small containers

162
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,478
and get like a decent personal yield out

163
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,478
of it like one gallon containers so i

164
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,240
thought that was cool you definitely can

165
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,000
i'll give you a quick tip i had some

166
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,240
seeds have been harder for me to start

167
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,959
for peppers and do it did you do like a

168
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,519
soak i did the paper towel soak with

169
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:08,079
them for probably at least

170
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,000
i was thinking it was two to maybe four

171
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,399
days keeping it soaked watching them

172
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,839
just just to start to get them to pop a

173
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,279
little and get their first little tail a

174
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,439
little root coming out and then i

175
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,839
planted them had much better success i

176
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,639
have to give that a try

177
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:22,000
yeah across the board for a bunch of

178
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,319
different seeds that actually can can

179
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,279
help out help get them excited to go

180
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,720
yeah i'm definitely gonna have to give

181
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,478
it another shot because peppers is

182
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,240
definitely something i want to grow um

183
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:33,279
you know not just those bull nose wands

184
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,478
or or bell style peppers or habaneros

185
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,159
it's endless

186
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,159
carolina reapers right that'd be cool to

187
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,000
grow one of those eventually

188
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,479
nice cool so do you typically grow

189
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,600
indoors outdoors or both both um so it

190
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:47,680
would be

191
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,400
indoors typically all the time except

192
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,319
for when it's summertime i have a

193
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,318
it's whether it's been a grow room

194
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,680
currently have a five by five grow tent

195
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,840
that i have out in my garage so

196
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,560
summertime i find it convenient wherever

197
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,399
your indoor grow i like to enjoy i call

198
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,399
it summer summer summertime and like i'm

199
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,799
usually so busy with the outdoor growing

200
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,959
going on in summer time that to have

201
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,800
to deal with both responsibilities as

202
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,879
well as the cleanliness you should be

203
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,639
doing when going between the two because

204
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,719
it's really easy to run around and just

205
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,720
go into your tent and go out so right

206
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,880
now outside for me

207
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,039
i only have two very small medicinal

208
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,038
plants because they're only in one

209
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,800
gallons right now i basically said i'm

210
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,959
going to quit growing my medicinal

211
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,720
plants outside where i'm at because of

212
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,318
the problems i've ran i'm in vancouver

213
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,759
british columbia here compared to

214
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,039
growing outside in colorado a whole

215
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,960
different animal

216
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,719
but i do keep busy with

217
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,879
like you said before i go peppers

218
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,639
outside every year strawberries actually

219
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,120
i've gotten into strawberry i've gone

220
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,879
strawberry basket crazy because i love

221
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,240
it keeps them one at head height for

222
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,000
when you're walking around to see what's

223
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,199
ready to pick and just

224
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,720
and then

225
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,639
two it can help keep a lot of different

226
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,319
pests away from them and then lastly a

227
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,519
bunch of tomatoes i don't eat tomatoes

228
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,960
my neighbor's like what you don't what

229
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,799
are you doing i'm like hey they're for

230
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,120
you they're for the wife they're for

231
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,120
gifting to the neighbors um but yeah

232
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,120
that'd be what's going on what's going

233
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,759
on as far as what i'm growing right now

234
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,120
uh but yeah no indoors not until fall

235
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,400
things got to cool off too sometimes

236
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,840
summer can just be too hot for the

237
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,038
indoor growers to have the proper

238
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,679
equipment

239
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:19,120
to maintain all that gotcha now on the

240
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,720
kind of medicinal plant side of things

241
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,319
are you the type of person that chases

242
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,000
after yield or did you kind of let the

243
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,400
plants do their thing and not really

244
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,720
worry about yield as much you're gonna

245
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,159
get yield typically outdoors i mean

246
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,278
we're talking like

247
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,360
these things love love to grow i'm not

248
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,439
ever usually chasing the old first it's

249
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,038
gonna know what you're starting with

250
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,120
what either you're starting with a

251
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:44,080
quality source seeds

252
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,600
or maybe some trusted cuts

253
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,600
so

254
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,519
chasing plant health first and foremost

255
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,800
but yield outside

256
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,159
people should remember when you're

257
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,799
thinking about grow medicinal plants

258
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,719
outside what what is your goal how much

259
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,479
is this just to try to see if you have a

260
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,080
green thumb and how which i believe

261
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,600
everybody has some sort of green it's

262
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,519
it's genetic it's in you um but

263
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,200
since you can get a lot of yield i mean

264
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,200
you could grow three five gallon plants

265
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,600
and depending on people's consumption

266
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,399
uh be good to go until the next season

267
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,560
around so and that being said upscaling

268
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,240
that you could grow two 20 gallon plants

269
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,278
you're like oh my god this is too much

270
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,839
too big

271
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:23,120
uh so no don't chase yield

272
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,720
but

273
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,560
yeah mainly know what i'm starting with

274
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,399
is super important what what potential

275
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,359
it has and that it's good genetics

276
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,399
gotcha

277
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,720
let's focus on growing outdoors really i

278
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,958
want to get into your style of growing i

279
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,160
want to start with with ipm and some of

280
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,239
my viewers are going to laugh at this

281
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,519
because usually ipm's at the very end

282
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,600
and i'm like hey we probably should have

283
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,120
started with ipm because it's just it's

284
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,839
so important and for those that don't

285
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,679
know ipm integrated pest management in

286
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,920
layman's terms it's really just things

287
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,838
that you do in order to prevent pests

288
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,240
right so um tell me what do you

289
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,760
typically do in order to prevent pests

290
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,919
well i like the last word in that it's

291
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,679
management right so

292
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,439
you're trying to prevent you're gonna

293
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,958
have pests outside

294
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,360
if you know your area if you have the

295
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,039
opportunity to talk to different growers

296
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,200
or even maybe some of the pests you'll

297
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,639
see on other garden plants you might get

298
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,640
an idea of what you're going to have to

299
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,720
deal with

300
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,958
so for me here i didn't talk to many

301
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,480
growers the area in vancouver especially

302
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,199
i'm in a little micro climate where i

303
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,240
live

304
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,079
tons of humidity and pests that kick my

305
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,000
butt are always new ones to me it's for

306
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,838
here it was called the corn ear worm on

307
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,240
my outdoor buds never dealt with that

308
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,160
before i had no clue

309
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,240
most important thing i'd say for ipm on

310
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:37,519
outdoors since we are in an environment

311
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,440
that we're not controlling as much as

312
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:44,159
the indoors is being there and scouting

313
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,160
also being able to thin out your plants

314
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,679
they can get so big and bushy so you

315
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,600
have air movement

316
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,039
depending on the size of them but

317
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,560
scouting and looking around because it

318
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,120
can be nice you could go by you can go

319
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,319
outdoors for two weeks maybe a month and

320
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,159
be walking around looking at your grow

321
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,720
and have no problems because nature's in

322
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,719
balance things are taking care of things

323
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,040
but then eventually what what happened

324
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,639
to me because i had a nice hops plant i

325
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,919
was growing some hops just to look cool

326
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,240
i'm not going to do anything with them

327
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,199
unfortunately i didn't have time to brew

328
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,079
as well

329
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,480
but

330
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,799
that brought in some aphids

331
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,039
which in turn they actually is this hops

332
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,278
plant was right next to medicinal plant

333
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,958
the aphids just preferred it for like a

334
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,799
few weeks they just stayed on it i'm

335
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,078
like okay if that was an indicator point

336
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,159
i'll call that then i'll leave them

337
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:29,919
alone to be there and eventually of

338
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,278
course they work their way over

339
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,039
um because i wanted to see what's

340
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,559
happened and then i i got a ton of

341
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,078
ladybugs ladybugs can be really good

342
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,078
outside for aphids especially since

343
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,838
they're big enough to watch them just go

344
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,319
on in and eat those suckers i'll just

345
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,920
stand out there with like hanging out

346
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,680
maybe with a pine or whatnot and just

347
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,519
watch them go to war and that was

348
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,278
refreshing when you can see the bugs are

349
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,879
big enough some of our predatory insects

350
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:52,320
aren't big enough to enjoy that but when

351
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,159
you can see them eating the bugs that

352
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,440
are going to bug your plant

353
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,519
that's really good i mean we can go as

354
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,480
deep as you want with ipm outdoors as

355
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,759
far as what to do when we we see pests

356
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,240
and whatnot but that's first off

357
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,919
scouting makes sense now are you also i

358
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,839
mean important pieces to check the

359
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,519
undersides of the leaves right i mean

360
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,279
yeah how do we do that for sure

361
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,159
underside of the leaves you're going to

362
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,439
want to be looking there a lot of bugs

363
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,600
i won't even say that i was going to say

364
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,399
a lot of bugs you can see by the naked

365
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,040
eye but you do need a loop i ran into

366
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,039
hemp rust that's outside one time

367
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,000
and you do need a magnification to see

368
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:28,559
those

369
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,399
spider mites like to start from my

370
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,638
notice on the lower parts of the plant

371
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,159
on the underside of the leaves

372
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,759
before you start to see a bunch of

373
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,919
damage going up the plant you can

374
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,439
usually catch them when you do run if we

375
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,120
want to do a preventative maintenance

376
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,079
let's let's say you notice maybe a few

377
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,240
aphids or a few spider mites so if we're

378
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,479
in veg we can the preventative spray i

379
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,079
know you like me i like neem as well i

380
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,560
actually don't mind the smell of neem at

381
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:54,078
all it's supernatural it's inexpensive

382
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,479
easy to apply

383
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,159
um but doing a type of spray program

384
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,360
once every week

385
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,278
isn't bad but i don't want to spray

386
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,879
anything that's going to hurt also if

387
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,639
things again i said are working like in

388
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,399
balance like nature the bugs are taking

389
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,680
care of each other i have a few i don't

390
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,200
want to hurt anything that's doing a

391
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,519
good job either

392
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,120
but predators outside

393
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,120
people that know okay this is my second

394
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,799
year and last year i got these predators

395
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,720
aren't cheap you got to get them quick

396
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,479
you got to get them viable if you know

397
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,920
you have a problem putting predators out

398
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,079
definitely are a good idea in the

399
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,559
outdoor environment um there's a lot of

400
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,078
good places uh to source those you can

401
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,638
go to local insectaries to search

402
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,000
beneficial insect insectaries on google

403
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,839
you'll pull up some options i don't know

404
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,799
if you've had anybody on or anything to

405
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,399
recommend but um yeah then there's

406
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,519
arbico organics i'll just throw that one

407
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,919
off the top i know they have a lot of

408
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,519
information on their site as far as

409
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:44,958
identifying predators which ones will

410
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,560
work good for you

411
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,719
and uh yeah

412
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,278
so that would be that would be it so

413
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,079
once a week spray is it just neem using

414
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:57,439
or using any other type of products um i

415
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:59,120
do like to use for me i use neem or for

416
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,639
whatever i'm spraying

417
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,799
typically i'll use a type of wetting

418
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,198
agent uh mine's optic foiler has a

419
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,479
product called trans transport

420
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:08,240
which i use

421
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,079
and that once a week spray i'm talking

422
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,839
about you know if i if i'm battling

423
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,519
something we got to break its cycle so

424
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,279
if we got spider mites and eggs are

425
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,679
hatching every three days and there's

426
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,120
variations there how hot is it out how

427
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,638
cold is it out is really going to affect

428
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,399
the cycle of some of these things but

429
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,480
you do have to spray if we're trying to

430
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,639
we've identified pests that want to take

431
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,879
care of them spraying every three days

432
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,198
for out i'm going to go for probably at

433
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,480
least 10 days to two weeks should break

434
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:33,919
their cycle

435
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,440
that being said you can choose both

436
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,039
methods though if you have a garden that

437
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,320
you're like you don't necessarily want

438
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,319
to spray and you have access to see what

439
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,839
the beneficials can do for you

440
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,680
i recommend going that route too i

441
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,279
usually will do a combination of both

442
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,479
when i add hemp brusset mites i'm doing

443
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:48,480
a spray i'm going to beat down the

444
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,159
population i'm going to assume which is

445
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,079
the number one downfall for people

446
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:53,759
spraying for pests it's really hard to

447
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,838
reach everywhere in your garden you have

448
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,159
to make contact

449
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,760
and that can be problematic so first

450
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:02,240
i'll do the spray cycle and then after

451
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,879
that i'll maybe do two releases of

452
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,159
beneficials just to hang out man maybe i

453
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,240
missed some eggs and things are gonna

454
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,838
hatch and that has always worked for me

455
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,039
just to take care of most pests and

456
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,040
pests for me

457
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,039
outside have been aphids those are

458
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,120
pretty easy they're sizable i haven't

459
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,198
gotten thrips outside i've seen some

460
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,799
spider mites hemp russet mites in

461
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,120
colorado they are just i don't know

462
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,479
they're popular for a little bit

463
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,560
but we can go into the other things too

464
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,800
where i talked about here

465
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,758
in british columbia bud rot

466
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,919
molds mildew oh my god nightmares

467
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,759
literally nightmares for me we'll save

468
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,360
that for the end we'll talk about some

469
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,000
of the other challenges that are going

470
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,839
on beyond pests uh yeah because that'll

471
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,039
be a real good conversation bud run in

472
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,199
particular because i've experienced that

473
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:47,278
as well so i can also speak about that

474
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,719
one forgot to mention um

475
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:49,759
this kind of ties into maybe you can

476
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,560
tell me if something else you're asking

477
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,959
me but healthy plants grow your plants

478
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:57,518
as happy and healthy as possible and

479
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,439
that helps a ton with pests

480
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,440
um you know a plant that's alien or

481
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,279
showing signs like the pets know they'll

482
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,920
come to that they'll have an easier

483
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:08,240
chance of taking it out so yeah i had

484
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:11,039
chad westport on my podcast a couple

485
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,560
weeks ago and he talked about bricks and

486
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,000
kind of how you can measure the sugar

487
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,919
content in the plant and if your brix

488
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,600
level is 12 or above then um pests don't

489
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,360
attack the plants which i thought was

490
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,720
pretty interesting so it's another way

491
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,720
to kind of

492
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,680
kind of see the health of your plant is

493
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,800
bricks

494
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,399
for those that don't know might want to

495
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,479
research a little bit more on that one

496
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,559
cool let's switch it up let's talk about

497
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,720
your media what are you using for uh

498
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,000
what's in your mix that can vary

499
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,440
definitely we're talking okay we're

500
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,879
outdoors

501
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,880
it's a lot of times can be what's

502
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,039
available to you and you look where you

503
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,278
live are you you live in colorado and

504
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:46,958
there's like 25 hydro store options

505
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,679
around you

506
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:52,879
that can be a variable for sure a base

507
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:55,599
for me would probably be uh the hp pro

508
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,278
mix bale of peat right that's because

509
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,399
it's just you can get a lot out of that

510
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,879
veil

511
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,159
it's compact and it's usually available

512
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:04,400
even at nurseries if you don't have

513
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,480
local grow stores and stuff

514
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,880
and then into pete i don't make a super

515
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,880
soil but i do like to put things in a

516
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,480
little bit warm cast just some basics

517
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,640
let's put some organics in our soil warm

518
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,959
castings are good to mix in

519
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,640
you could do a 20 mix of worm castings

520
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,558
you could do a 10 mix it's your call

521
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,160
there's a lot of recipes out there

522
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:24,160
which is going to give you some

523
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,798
nutrition it's going to give a diversity

524
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,640
in your bacteria and your living soil

525
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,119
other things i know you're a fan of when

526
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,038
we had you on insect frass it's just a

527
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,199
cool product i'm learning more about it

528
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:37,599
mixing that in your soil

529
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,840
also works really well i have been

530
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:42,399
cutting on and off playing with cutting

531
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,759
some cocoa into the peat it seems to

532
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,440
help with its like water inability peat

533
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:48,720
gets hydrophobic if you don't catch it

534
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,400
quick enough for your water on the top

535
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,759
or it sucks in a little from the side of

536
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,080
your containers

537
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,720
um and then you gotta the water kind of

538
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,639
beads off for a minute until absorbs in

539
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,360
uh different ratios of cocoa i've messed

540
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,440
with i've done like 25 cocoa to peat

541
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,279
ratio and it does help with that water

542
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,600
and inability which i've liked

543
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,359
so and that's it i don't usually mix in

544
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,519
a lot more organics i usually don't go

545
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,119
to i'm not a living soil grower although

546
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,480
i do like to put some things in my soil

547
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,759
and leave room in my containers to do

548
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,640
top dresses

549
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,160
um

550
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,280
and then after that

551
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,640
um

552
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:21,519
yeah that would be the base of my mix

553
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,720
i'm trying to think of anything i'm

554
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:24,879
forgetting that i like to put in there

555
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,960
because like again sometimes it it does

556
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,520
vary oh some compost if there is some

557
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,160
nice compost i don't mind mixing in

558
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,160
another 10 compost

559
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,320
as well and all this just helps the

560
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,400
overall mix i know some people do some

561
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:39,200
additional aeration due to anything like

562
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,240
uh

563
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,480
perlite

564
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,160
there's enough in uh at that specific

565
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,440
pete perlite

566
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,279
uh for sure and most if you don't

567
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,600
if you're getting a straight pete then

568
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,119
yeah i would be adding in perlite for

569
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,279
sure i would say

570
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:57,119
20 again there's a lot of good recipes

571
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,798
out there search around uh shout out to

572
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,479
build a soil they got some good recipes

573
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,000
they actually have if you want to get

574
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,919
that bale of heat you can just get a

575
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,440
nutrient to men kit it's like in the

576
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,480
instructions it makes it really easy so

577
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,240
you don't have to go out source all

578
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,679
these different nutrients if you're

579
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,200
trying to do somewhat of a living soil

580
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,400
and when i say living soil everybody

581
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,720
typically i shouldn't say everyone

582
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,160
typically knows it's a nose but a an

583
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,000
enriched soil that's going to be you're

584
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,480
relying on your soil more to feed your

585
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,960
plants than you putting liquid or other

586
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,880
nutrient inputs in great point now how

587
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,919
about container size what do you

588
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,559
typically

589
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,480
start in what do you typically end up in

590
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:31,678
i mean that's like what kind of car do

591
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,880
you like because there's so many

592
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:37,280
variables with container size

593
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,039
um we just talked about this again when

594
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,359
you're on our show shout out to coming

595
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,119
on the dude grow show but what

596
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,119
how are you going to feed your plant

597
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,119
i've noticed and i'm learning my peppers

598
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,759
that i have now which is i think almost

599
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,639
too small are in one gallon containers

600
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:52,640
right

601
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,559
you got to feed those a lot one gallon

602
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,400
isn't as we call it a big enough battery

603
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,240
like it's just not it can't hold enough

604
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,280
organic matter nutrition whatever that

605
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,759
gets fed liquid nutrients uh quite often

606
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:05,200
the bigger your container the bigger

607
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:06,879
battery

608
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,558
but if you could have an enriched mix

609
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,840
let's say but i'm going to tell people

610
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,440
man it's still relevant i was going to

611
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,119
tell people to do at least a 10 gallon

612
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,038
outside but you can see

613
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,519
somebody that just has maybe a small

614
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,279
apartment with a balcony and they do

615
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,639
three autoflowers

616
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,399
in a uh

617
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,679
in three gals

618
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,120
you know what i mean

619
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,400
so

620
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,119
but i guess we're here i'm talking about

621
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,840
my style i like to go at least

622
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:35,199
i'm gonna say 20 to 25 gallon if i can

623
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:37,439
outside you don't want to be chasing

624
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,120
after water on hot days depending on

625
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,120
your irrigation setup

626
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,119
so the smaller the container on hotter

627
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,119
days the more you have to water

628
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,399
you do have to keep on them more with

629
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,199
feeding

630
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,720
so

631
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,159
bigger is going to be better smaller

632
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,919
usually has a little bit more work on

633
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,600
your end a little bit more maintenance

634
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,799
uh and yeah and container type i like

635
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:58,399
i don't like the black nursery

636
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,759
containers man they just it's like i

637
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,080
wish they made them white which is

638
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,599
probably more expensive on hot days they

639
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,119
sit there you can touch the side of a

640
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,839
black nursery container and i just feel

641
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:10,158
like my roots and my rhizosphere and my

642
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,480
plants just going to be upset about that

643
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,919
and require more maintenance more water

644
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,000
so

645
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,440
fabric pots are great there's all kinds

646
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,599
of brands out there

647
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,440
uh there's different i use product

648
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:24,240
called radical bags it's kind of like a

649
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,240
mesh pvc fabric type thing

650
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,558
but yeah container size as well as is

651
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,240
import container type i've seen people

652
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:31,839
kill it in the five gallon home depot

653
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,279
buckets though you know or you see

654
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:34,720
people planting the 30 gallon rubber

655
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,399
made trash can i love it just the

656
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,679
monstrous tree

657
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,519
are you

658
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,080
just planting that seed directly into

659
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:43,440
that 20 gallon or are you starting in a

660
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,359
small

661
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,960
pot for sure

662
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,719
what's your transplanting

663
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,880
method or techniques like when do you

664
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,038
transplant uh so

665
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,200
you could go outside

666
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,720
pretty early or not it depends um where

667
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,279
i want to end up but i'll just say i go

668
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:03,038
into first typical for a lot of people a

669
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:04,399
one gallon nursery pot size container

670
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,400
i will start a plant in there you can

671
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,880
keep a plant in there for as long as you

672
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,120
want and watch it get angry and hold it

673
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,240
back or keep topping it but when i go i

674
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:16,319
go from that one gal which is gonna be

675
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,400
not fully root bound but like ready to

676
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,480
go whatever i put it in and i'm gonna

677
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,080
put that one gal probably into my

678
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,240
finishing container i know some people

679
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,960
so if i go from a one gal boom i'm gonna

680
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,798
go outside into my 25 gal you don't want

681
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,319
to over water that it could be easy to

682
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:33,759
do but i skip the one maybe people would

683
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,599
go to a five

684
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,759
and then to the bigger size container

685
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,519
because i just don't want to up pot and

686
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,519
do it's not that labor intensive for me

687
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,679
because i'm not doing that many plants

688
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,119
but i like to go from the one gal to my

689
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,360
finishing size whether that might be a

690
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:51,519
five mine is going to be at least a 20

691
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:53,359
to 25 gal and i know that's not as as uh

692
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,119
best nursery practices i think it's

693
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,639
caller scotty what is he called

694
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:57,918
something best management nursery

695
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,280
practices they're they're typically

696
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,679
they're going like

697
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,440
one three five or one they're like

698
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,880
they're keeping it all and that can keep

699
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,159
your plant chugging along a little bit

700
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,240
better uh but yeah this is my transplant

701
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,679
schedule i i think it comes down to

702
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,359
personal preference i mean some people

703
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,400
have space control constraints they're

704
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,678
going to start indoors and they're going

705
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,880
to stay in that small container they're

706
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,679
going to try to stay as a small

707
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,919
container as possible and then you know

708
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,000
transplant some folks don't want to like

709
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,840
you mentioned over watering would be a

710
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,558
thing that could happen if you have this

711
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:30,399
small plant in a large container so

712
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,558
it comes down to personal preference in

713
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,400
my opinion on transplanting what

714
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,399
container size to use so on and so forth

715
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,159
i don't like to deter anybody on i mean

716
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,600
this is talking about my girl style like

717
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,080
i said before

718
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,000
oh you're saying at least a 20 or 25 man

719
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:46,558
you can do a one gal if you want you

720
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,558
could try all kinds of stuff um that's

721
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,200
one thing about as far as these

722
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:53,038
medicinal plants they love to grow

723
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,319
outside when you have you know you're

724
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:55,759
not worried about having the the

725
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,439
expensive nice grow light you got the

726
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:00,158
best girl out on earth the sun kicking

727
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,919
butt for you um it's it's hard to kill

728
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,320
these things they love to grow and

729
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,480
there's a lot of ways to do it so do it

730
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,918
my way is not always

731
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,919
there's a lot of different styles i want

732
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,360
to throw in there well said

733
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,520
now how about nutrients what do you

734
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,879
typically use for base nutrients and

735
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,038
additives

736
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,880
all right so base nutrients and

737
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,960
additives

738
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,120
so my base nutrients so my mix initially

739
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,880
it's not that enriched right it's the

740
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,319
the base peat some cocoa we're going to

741
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,480
get a little nutrition from the worm

742
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,558
castings not much a little nutrition

743
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,640
from the insect frass

744
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,000
and that could last me maybe a few

745
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,520
waterings or whatever but i have to get

746
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,720
water in this thing with some nutrients

747
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,200
right away

748
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,278
i usually use a set of bottles lacing

749
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,120
recently um actually for like the past

750
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:46,880
three or four years i've been using uh

751
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:49,199
ramos nutrients nutrient line and just

752
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,520
it's a basic i can follow the feed chart

753
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,840
it's eight or five mils of all the

754
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:55,440
product that's light though like i'm not

755
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,839
going to a high

756
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,080
ppm the highest parts per million so ppm

757
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,918
and ec is how you guys measure your what

758
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,839
how much nutrient is in your your

759
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,960
solution if you don't have that pen

760
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:06,639
you're looking at a feed chart you're

761
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,640
like well i put in x you know you're

762
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,038
probably going to be within the range um

763
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,038
that they want you to be in

764
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:14,158
but that's that's not my only nutrition

765
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:16,240
and some people will be like that's

766
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,600
pretty low 700 parts per million

767
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,359
well then i'm also going to take a break

768
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,959
with some of my as we say the fish

769
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:22,798
brings the dank maybe i'm going to add

770
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,880
in so there's a bunch of different fish

771
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,879
fertilizers out there a little bit of

772
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,799
fish because i like to diversify what

773
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,640
inputs i'm putting in and i believe you

774
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:32,240
know i like some of the thicker funkier

775
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,840
products at times

776
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,798
or top dressing i know you like the top

777
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:37,199
dress

778
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,440
um i used to before i start stopped

779
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,880
using bat guano i do need to do more

780
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,640
research into

781
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,240
i think i saw an uh like a scary

782
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,559
documentary on netflix where i'm like

783
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,079
this is how they get the sea bird like i

784
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:49,918
don't know man and how the people in

785
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,278
their camps it just didn't seem cool to

786
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,000
me i'll look into it a little more but

787
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:55,519
when i had back guano it's a good um

788
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,839
bone actually i think i have fish bone

789
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,200
meal now which is a byproduct of the

790
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,599
fishing industry which is a high

791
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,600
phosphorus i'll take these products and

792
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,759
i'll do a top dress at different points

793
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:06,959
in the grow maybe it's blooms really

794
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:08,720
coming on

795
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,319
just to feed the plant in all different

796
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,960
ways i feel like i'm giving it's that

797
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:15,918
the word synganic uh or you're feeding

798
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,759
synthetically or salt-based nutrients

799
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,159
and organically or just you know

800
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:23,519
nutrients and i do stay away from meals

801
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:26,640
i get a little freaked out of uh big ag

802
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,879
bone meal blood meal just i don't know

803
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,200
i i need to learn more about what

804
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,360
possibly might be in those byproducts i

805
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,360
don't know if any of the antibiotics or

806
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,119
funkiness from that industry comes over

807
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,399
but i don't i have other things i can

808
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:39,918
use in my garden where i don't need to

809
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,679
use those so

810
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,600
i'm trying to think what else i do have

811
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,159
some favorite like i don't know if you

812
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,959
do like do you water in with any bottles

813
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,640
at all yeah sometimes yeah yeah do you

814
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,558
have any favorite bloom additives or

815
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,960
something like that's the typical

816
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:56,879
additive or that you would use i used to

817
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,038
use back in the days to use

818
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,559
a pk booster used to use beastie blooms

819
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,879
by fox farm when i was using the fox

820
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:04,240
farm lineup and that that helped

821
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,919
and it was always when i worked

822
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,440
hydroponic retail it would be one of the

823
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,278
most hottest like people be like all

824
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,519
right i'm a month into flower what kind

825
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:14,558
of boost does he got like let's what

826
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,158
kind of boost oh this is a zero 60 you

827
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:17,918
know like they just get pumped but it's

828
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,520
not all about that i do really like it's

829
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,320
kind of a unique one

830
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:24,398
massive from green planet is a

831
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:25,839
like a trichantinol type and there's

832
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:27,759
more in it than that i don't even know

833
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:30,079
if they can market it as that

834
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,480
but it's one i really dig on i'm trying

835
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,839
to think what other bloom boost is

836
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,919
typically if you have your base

837
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,918
nutrition really rocked though it's not

838
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,000
about doing a big on booster you can

839
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,000
mess up things in your isosphere you can

840
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,759
kind of i think affect what's going on

841
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,440
with the microbes if you go too high in

842
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:47,759
with phosphorus

843
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,840
so watch that but yeah that would be one

844
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,359
of my my many main additives and of

845
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,199
course i haven't said it in any of this

846
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,798
i use re i know you like recharge i use

847
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,640
recharge across throughout the grow

848
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,278
that's one of the things that in a

849
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,278
roundabout way for me ties into ipm

850
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,200
recharge guys is just a

851
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:05,038
microbial inoculant if you aren't using

852
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,558
microbes you want to be adding microbes

853
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:09,038
we only have so much time with this

854
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:11,278
plant right to get it right uh and kick

855
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:13,679
out a good a good crop are there any

856
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,759
other microbial nockins you use beyond

857
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,840
recharge and do you use any sugars like

858
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:20,000
some people use molasses honey brown

859
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,720
sugar did you do any of that or

860
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,398
um recharge has enough molasses in it

861
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,440
where i don't need to add another sugar

862
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:27,759
sugar guys it's going to feed the

863
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,919
microbes i like to diversify my sugars

864
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,119
because i think if i'm a microbe maybe i

865
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,840
want to eat something different than

866
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:35,918
molasses today that's where i get into

867
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,839
god i don't know the name fox farm has

868
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,000
uh they have a lion something like a

869
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:42,480
bembe or bimbe line maybe it's actually

870
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,440
called bimbe it's like a sugar

871
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,278
uh from i believe from beets

872
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,038
i was like interesting okay i can

873
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:51,839
picture maybe some maybe some of the

874
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:54,240
microbes and this is kind of bro science

875
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:56,319
or just me making myself a microbe will

876
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,880
be more turned on by eating some of this

877
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:01,359
beet sugar today and do some type of

878
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,039
different attribute in my my terpene

879
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,199
profile you know

880
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,798
um so other than that what other sugars

881
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,360
have i used

882
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:11,278
just those two mainly as far as a sugar

883
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,038
to feed them microbes

884
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:16,398
yeah another micro product sorry you

885
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:18,398
asked um i did i haven't since just

886
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,079
availability up here microbes in canada

887
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:21,839
are really good it's just goofy

888
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,079
regulation thing hard to get their hands

889
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,079
on some um

890
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,599
oh mammoth p damn i don't know i'm

891
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:30,000
stumbling on that mammoth p i've used on

892
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,839
and off uh as well

893
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,440
and i have it in a while but i would

894
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:35,599
still recommend

895
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,600
at transplant there are some cool i

896
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:38,959
don't know if you know any but um

897
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:40,639
mycorrhizae products that are

898
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,360
specifically one strain i think the

899
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,480
intradices that it's nice at transplant

900
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,639
to get that

901
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,240
on i think mycos when you can get that

902
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,440
on the root zone when you're actually

903
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,960
transplanting you can put some

904
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,038
mycorrhizae in the hole make sure you

905
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,120
get that connection that's one good time

906
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:57,278
to use another type of that's actually a

907
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,199
fungi mycorrhizae i pretty much use the

908
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:01,679
same products i think the the mammoth p

909
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,679
and recharge combination is incredible i

910
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,759
mean they both just work so well

911
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,919
together you know i remember using

912
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:09,119
recharging mammoth p several grows ago

913
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,799
and

914
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:13,599
taking it out of the one gallon

915
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:16,558
container uh the roots were just

916
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:17,678
so amazingly pearly white like beautiful

917
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,960
and just

918
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,399
i i never got that before you know using

919
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,120
recharge you know

920
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,639
so uh in mammoth p together so i highly

921
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,479
recommend that combination for anybody

922
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,240
who is interested in

923
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,240
you know using trying out some new micro

924
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,839
products learn about microbes too if you

925
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,240
guys you don't have to learn a ton but

926
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,158
um that wasn't like i don't know my top

927
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,319
three i don't know if it was led

928
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,559
lighting co2 and microbes off the top my

929
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,398
head but microbes man game changer for

930
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:46,879
the grow you're gonna do a lot better

931
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,398
and don't think it's a misconception um

932
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,240
i used to think this as well like oh

933
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:51,918
well i'm using synthetic nutrients or

934
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,038
salt-based nutrients or this it's just

935
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,440
it's not going to work well with the

936
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,038
microbes they can work together for sure

937
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,880
in your grow media

938
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:01,278
so yeah look into that if you're not

939
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,799
it'll it'll help you grow great point

940
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:04,000
now you mentioned one other thing on

941
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:05,839
feeding i know you mentioned ramo

942
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,960
nutrients and you measure mention these

943
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,599
other things you're doing some top

944
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,000
feeding fish so on and so forth are you

945
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:13,918
following the feeding schedule for remo

946
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,159
nutrients at all or are you doing a

947
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,320
reduced dose or are you not looking at

948
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,640
that feeding schedule i try to just have

949
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:22,240
a plan i mean i feel the feeding

950
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,600
schedule as a basis their line

951
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,440
specifically

952
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:27,119
um it's super easy because it's always

953
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,399
the same amount

954
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,879
across the board doesn't matter what

955
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,879
bottle you're using until

956
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,200
you know if you you can start off at

957
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,880
five mils and that gives you this ppm

958
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,399
and then you can go up to eight mils or

959
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,840
you can go up to ten mils so it depends

960
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,439
on what you're doing

961
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,000
so i don't follow a feeding schedule

962
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,759
particularly um as far as a new grower

963
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
sometimes it's nice to say okay here's a

964
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:50,158
nutrient line let me hand you their

965
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,919
feeding schedule you follow this and you

966
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,039
should be good and that's right you

967
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,840
should be good

968
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:58,558
know your quality your quality your

969
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,879
water starting points if you can if

970
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,960
you're on a well or whatever you're on

971
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,840
it is nice to know to get either a water

972
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,240
test

973
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:09,359
know your starting pp or a ph my

974
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,759
starting ph is seven i'm on a well here

975
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:14,079
in british columbia my ppms off the tap

976
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:15,759
are i think one it's like the water's so

977
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,519
good here

978
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:19,679
there's nothing in it but to know that

979
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,440
starting point is good

980
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,960
for sure and then after that you should

981
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,399
succeed the only thing that'll mess up a

982
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,480
feeding chart

983
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:29,038
is if you have hiccups in the grow and

984
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,200
you you need to slow down on something

985
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:33,919
or you need to not feed

986
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,200
um and then outside speaking of all this

987
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,480
i don't know if this ties into something

988
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,080
you got coming up

989
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,679
if your plants aren't protected from

990
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:41,439
weather and rain

991
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,840
rain alone is going to

992
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,679
adjust like if it keeps raining and

993
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:47,278
you're like damn i gotta water in my

994
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,240
liquid nutrients i gotta get nutrition

995
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,000
in there

996
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,919
that can be a conundrum because your

997
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,759
plants wet already

998
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,159
and that's why it's good to cover

999
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,158
yourself with well it's been raining but

1000
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,919
i did have some top dress so that's kind

1001
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,120
of like a tip there if you know you got

1002
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,559
some weather coming because it could

1003
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:04,558
rain for like a week straight happen to

1004
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:06,319
be in colorado plants are always wet i

1005
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,558
can't add any nutrition

1006
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:10,480
nor are they probably going crazy at

1007
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:12,879
that point it's cloudy out it's been

1008
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,399
raining on them but if you can't add

1009
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,240
nutrition and no weather's coming you

1010
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:17,599
can always top dress some nutrition as

1011
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,440
well and that doesn't even have to be

1012
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:21,839
organic amendments they have vegetable

1013
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,080
granular fertilizer out there or it's

1014
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,439
just like osmocote type stuff we just

1015
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,599
sprinkle a little on there and you know

1016
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,200
if you you water through with plain

1017
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:30,398
water you're going to get nutrition if

1018
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,840
that answered your question with the

1019
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:33,518
feeding chart

1020
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,199
yeah i'm not rambling i got my cold brew

1021
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,120
kicking in here a little caffeine going

1022
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,120
so just if you cut me off at all i don't

1023
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:40,398
know no that's all good you're actually

1024
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:41,678
ahead of the game a little bit my next

1025
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:44,158
question was going to be about water and

1026
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,080
you touched on well water uh you know

1027
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,240
your water source is clean going in

1028
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:50,319
which is good my next question was going

1029
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,720
to be talking about ph

1030
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:54,720
now as your ph good like what does it

1031
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,919
come in at to begin and are you doing

1032
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,679
any sort of adjustments are you

1033
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,759
monitoring it all or

1034
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,759
okay i got that just quick with the well

1035
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:04,079
water if you guys got hard well like if

1036
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,519
you got high ppm in your well water

1037
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:09,199
let's say you get a little pen and it's

1038
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,559
like holy it's like at 400 500 600

1039
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,838
it's good to know what's in there i

1040
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:13,440
think i haven't had to deal with it i'm

1041
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:15,440
no expert a lot of times i think it

1042
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,480
could be calcium there are different

1043
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,358
liquid nutrients that um you can adjust

1044
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,960
your nutrients to that ppm so you're not

1045
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:25,199
giving too much of one thing or the

1046
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,960
other but if you do have that high of

1047
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,480
ppm i would like to know what's in there

1048
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,838
i would consider a water test if that's

1049
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,358
going to be your main source or after

1050
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:34,078
that if you don't you got to look at a

1051
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,838
water filtration system such as ro which

1052
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,760
gives you a zero starting point that's

1053
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:39,519
why uh when

1054
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,200
commercial facilities when they got to

1055
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:42,639
replicate their feeding plan across

1056
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,279
multiple facilities or anything

1057
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,800
everybody has the same ro system so when

1058
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,560
the lead grower over here is looking

1059
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,760
over here he knows everybody's starting

1060
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:52,159
at the same point at least with

1061
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,000
nutrients so if you do have or even city

1062
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,200
water not just well water check that man

1063
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,239
i've heard of some people say they're i

1064
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,239
don't know what's your do you know what

1065
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,719
your ppm is where you're at is it high

1066
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,479
my tap is like 485

1067
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:05,199
yeah do you know what now what what's in

1068
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,440
there or what does that uh i mean i have

1069
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:09,439
the water report that i get from the

1070
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,639
from the city but i don't i

1071
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,320
don't know i know what i can't always

1072
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:14,159
trust that either so many it seems like

1073
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,680
variables with what's in the pipes

1074
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:16,639
between here and there and the other

1075
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:18,399
thing

1076
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,319
but anyway check that guys know your

1077
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,480
water report then you asked about ph my

1078
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,720
starting ph is seven

1079
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,480
um i don't know most nutrients i don't

1080
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:29,118
know about most rainbow nutrients buffer

1081
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,440
down typically i think they anticipate

1082
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,920
a seven-ish starting point because i

1083
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,960
always brings me down within range which

1084
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:40,000
is going to be upper fives five point

1085
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,838
nine to six point i'll order in 5.9 to

1086
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,159
6.45

1087
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,239
or even high excuse me even higher if

1088
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:48,000
you have a lot of microbes active

1089
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:49,439
they're going to help buffer out and

1090
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,679
take care of this if you're a little out

1091
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,599
of range okay and then you touched on

1092
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:55,039
ppm and ec earlier a little bit you

1093
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,200
threw out a couple values i knew

1094
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,440
throughout 700 ppm can you tell me like

1095
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,519
what values you aim for like some people

1096
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,880
will start with a low ppm during

1097
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:04,639
seedling stage then they'll kind of work

1098
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,760
their way up can you tell me kind of

1099
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:10,719
your strategy for ppm or ec

1100
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,119
yeah i think uh it's been overdone a lot

1101
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:14,719
with the people like to push medicinal

1102
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,400
plants super hard to get the most they

1103
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:17,759
can out of it and then

1104
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,760
maybe you should

1105
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,680
come on back and try to go lower mine

1106
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:26,560
would be okay early veg i'm around

1107
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:28,480
you know three four hundred prime time

1108
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,078
veg meaning man these things are going

1109
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,519
everything's happy i could go you can go

1110
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,359
up to

1111
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,759
i'm still staying probably around though

1112
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,920
five to six hundred and i'm not saying

1113
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,760
if you went higher it might

1114
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,358
this can be strain dependent as well

1115
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,640
depending on your plants

1116
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:43,440
um

1117
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:47,039
but

1118
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,559
750 to 800 is what i max out out at and

1119
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,559
i don't see

1120
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:52,159
i see not diminish i guess diminishing

1121
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:54,480
returns might be the right phrase when i

1122
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:55,759
go higher i'm not seeing more come out

1123
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,079
of the plant

1124
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,680
you can mess with it of course if you're

1125
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,079
growing the same type of plant season

1126
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:04,719
after season but if you change up the

1127
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,880
strain or the plant type then you just

1128
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:09,279
how do you track that but less seems to

1129
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,519
be more typically i'll say not all of

1130
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,200
them nutrient companies want to put down

1131
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:14,559
like what they're not going to put down

1132
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:16,159
the least amount you could use i mean

1133
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:17,199
they i'm not saying they're there to rip

1134
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:18,799
you off

1135
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:21,039
um but they're going to go a little bit

1136
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,800
on the higher end sometimes the nutrient

1137
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,800
charts offer three different levels i've

1138
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,880
seen like it's funny some will be like

1139
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,400
are you at the master level are you at

1140
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,760
the pro level are you at the beginner

1141
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,119
level which i don't know why they work

1142
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,200
like that

1143
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,960
but less is more see what your plant

1144
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:36,879
don't overdo it under doing it's a

1145
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,280
little better i mean if you want to try

1146
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,039
and bump up at different times go for it

1147
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,640
but again using microbes i keep going

1148
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,400
there

1149
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,799
that helps with nutrition across the

1150
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,559
board and i have not needed high ppm at

1151
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,160
all since doing that i'm always lower

1152
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:51,039
than the feed chart and if you don't

1153
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,039
want to mess with all that you're

1154
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:55,599
intimidated by that you don't have to

1155
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:57,920
you put a plant out in a container with

1156
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,480
some enriched soil some compost

1157
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,400
water in some microbes and you know

1158
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,199
there's also just

1159
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,760
bagged soil out there that uh ocean

1160
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:09,598
forest is the most commonly available

1161
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,839
across the nation or i've heard

1162
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,680
different growers granted uh it's not

1163
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:15,838
going to work for all strains but man

1164
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,919
all they did is water in with some ocean

1165
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:20,078
forest which is enriched soil and i

1166
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,440
gotta harvest uh you probably can do

1167
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,280
better you're probably gonna run out of

1168
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,519
nutrition getting towards middle towards

1169
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,720
the end but this it can be real easy or

1170
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:31,119
easier than worrying about ppm ph but i

1171
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:33,519
grow synganic so both values i'm taking

1172
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,000
care of all of it gotcha let's flip up

1173
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,119
and talk about plant training so what

1174
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,159
plant training techniques do you

1175
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,440
typically do in outdoors on it outside

1176
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:43,358
when these things want to grow like

1177
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,720
beasts i mean

1178
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:47,199
you can do a lot of different training

1179
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:48,799
tactics i mean if it's uh

1180
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,480
first would be

1181
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,320
you're going to want to top a bit uh

1182
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,000
because these plants you're going to

1183
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,880
when you're going to go to bloom

1184
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,960
in colorado it was around mid-august i'd

1185
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,000
start to see flowers come in i'd assume

1186
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,599
i was two weeks in um i wouldn't i would

1187
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,920
want my plants to be and this is

1188
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,320
relevant to uh you know how big of

1189
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,320
plants you can grow but i would top them

1190
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,039
back like three or four times top in

1191
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,079
your plant you're taking off x amount of

1192
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:17,679
the top of your plant down to a node um

1193
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,920
and you can you know google that out and

1194
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,679
see exactly it's pretty easy to do

1195
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,838
the only time you you don't want to do

1196
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:25,199
this if you know like oh man i'm going

1197
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:27,519
to be going to bloom probably in about

1198
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:30,319
10 days for me i set that date at august

1199
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:32,559
15th so the last time i do some topping

1200
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,160
would be maybe august 1st so i have a

1201
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:35,519
little bit of recovery time for new

1202
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:36,879
shoots to come out

1203
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:39,039
and everything to be good but keep in

1204
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,280
mind you're going to gain at least i'm

1205
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:43,920
going to say across the board two feet

1206
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,680
if not three feet maybe four feet when

1207
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,358
you get into bloom and that's when

1208
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,039
training can come in too

1209
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:50,239
where you're doing you're bending over

1210
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:51,759
you can literally

1211
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,919
make sure your plants properly watered

1212
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,320
and healthy bending over your stems some

1213
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,838
people will just bend to not get a break

1214
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,280
sometimes i even bend to get a little

1215
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:00,400
bit of a break in the stem because i

1216
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,519
know how quick these are going to

1217
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,280
recover

1218
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:04,719
you can do tie down method where you're

1219
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,160
taking part of a plant and you're

1220
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:09,039
bending it way over here maybe because

1221
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:12,078
it needs to stay below a fence

1222
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:14,318
and also thinning outside thinning your

1223
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,839
plants out to get rid of those micro

1224
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:17,119
climates when you're out there scouting

1225
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:18,880
for pests

1226
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,318
you're not going crazy through like you

1227
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,480
gotta thin it out a little for air

1228
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:24,960
movement and not creating micro climates

1229
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,039
uh for pests and speaking about the

1230
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,318
fence uh the having the plant not grow

1231
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:30,480
over the fence i think you got i got

1232
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:32,800
some some good comments on whatever

1233
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,240
outdoor security your neighbors that

1234
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,400
kind of thing as well i think you have a

1235
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:40,239
question on here i know some people who

1236
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,318
swear by the 45 degree angle method they

1237
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:44,719
just do this one outdoors particular

1238
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:46,318
they just do a one bend of that bean

1239
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:48,399
chute at 45 degrees that's going to

1240
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,159
allow the lowers to come up which i

1241
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,800
thought was pretty interesting it really

1242
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,078
helps create more shoots coming up so

1243
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,160
it's not just like a christmas tree

1244
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,400
style that you typically see

1245
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:00,879
so that's one basic easy thing that you

1246
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,000
can do for for training um you know when

1247
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,079
growing outdoors you can do it indoors

1248
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,159
too sure but um we're you know we're

1249
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,039
focusing on outdoors on this video now

1250
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:11,440
what about uh more more so pruning

1251
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:13,358
defoliation lollipopping do you do any

1252
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,119
of that stuff growing outdoors yeah for

1253
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:17,440
sure defoliation i mean that was tying

1254
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,039
into kind of where i'm talking about

1255
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,760
thinning out your canopy thinning out

1256
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:23,519
your mid lollipopping like you said

1257
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,720
definitely that's bringing up your lower

1258
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:26,880
branches

1259
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:28,879
so again that can be an area where if

1260
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,318
you have that all thick down there where

1261
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,480
you might get a problem at the soil i

1262
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:34,559
like to see my soil level

1263
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,318
i was about to say i like to put sticky

1264
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,880
traps out at soil level but that's more

1265
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:40,559
for indoors for me sticky traps outside

1266
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,358
i feel like i'm catching some good guys

1267
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:45,519
too and it hurts my feelings but

1268
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,519
um yeah pruning your plant up

1269
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:49,119
lollipopping it up uh definitely

1270
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:50,239
important you'll get even more of those

1271
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,318
shoots it was hard for me as a new

1272
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:54,399
grower to cut off a lot of the lower

1273
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:57,199
ones because it's like oh there's going

1274
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,480
to be some good flour on here or here

1275
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:00,799
but really

1276
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,639
taking those off and i don't like to

1277
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,560
fully like pop it up two or three feet

1278
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,559
but taking a lot of those off

1279
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:08,318
to enable to send that energy and to

1280
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:11,440
send all that to the upper parts of the

1281
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:14,318
plant uh works great let's get into

1282
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,920
challenges growing outdoors so

1283
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:17,599
indoors outdoors totally different

1284
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,440
battlefield i mean we already talked

1285
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,920
about pests that's one challenge you

1286
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,599
gotta face

1287
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,800
i just i was just scrolling my notes i

1288
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,960
didn't want to mention one other thing

1289
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,519
before i forget about ipm uh we don't

1290
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,480
have this option as much on the indoors

1291
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:33,838
and outside if it doesn't i mean

1292
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,440
depending my plants are usually always

1293
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:37,358
covered outside which we can get into

1294
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,639
but spraying your plant taking the hose

1295
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:40,719
and just

1296
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,239
giving your plants a really good wash i

1297
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:44,078
mean it's a sim plus you're gonna get

1298
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:47,358
naturally outside you'll get some type

1299
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,800
of dust or pollen or you'd be actually

1300
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,119
for me here now in british columbia

1301
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,200
smoke particles some fires going on

1302
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,599
somewhere washing your plants is a good

1303
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:57,679
idea and same it'll wash off potential

1304
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,280
negative egg sacs or pests that are

1305
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:00,719
bothering stuff and it's super easy to

1306
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,720
do even if it was once every other day

1307
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,959
and just just clean off your outside

1308
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:06,959
garden it's a good a good tip

1309
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,880
sorry no all good so you just blast them

1310
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,400
with plain water now when you say wash

1311
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,720
your plants are you also talking about

1312
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,639
bud washing at the end after harvesting

1313
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:16,159
i haven't done bud washing and when you

1314
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:17,440
wash your plants it'll show your weak

1315
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:19,199
points and where you might not have them

1316
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,800
staked up properly as well because

1317
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,159
sometimes they'll just bend way over

1318
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,760
whatever but

1319
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:25,118
get that those plants staked up with

1320
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,359
bamboo

1321
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:30,160
bud washing i mean it's it's not the end

1322
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:31,598
of the world if your buds get wet um if

1323
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,399
they get rained on but i don't

1324
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,160
intentionally try to wash buds at any

1325
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,559
point with the yeah pressurized

1326
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:40,480
pressurized water okay now some of the

1327
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:42,400
other challenges that you've faced uh

1328
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,159
growing outdoors um like i was

1329
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,079
mentioning is this there's so many

1330
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:47,118
different things beyond pests one of the

1331
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,880
things that you had mentioned earlier

1332
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,318
was bud rod you want to talk about bud

1333
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,920
rod a little bit

1334
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:53,199
sure because that was one that just came

1335
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,480
i mean there's a few different types

1336
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:55,439
like bud rot

1337
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,679
can be

1338
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,358
just some rot in the bud that you get

1339
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,838
from a type of

1340
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:04,318
like bacteria or mold i believe

1341
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:06,400
sometimes just buds that are really big

1342
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:08,800
and dense i grew big bud crossed with

1343
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,480
white widow outside and the buds were so

1344
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,318
big and beautiful looking and i didn't

1345
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,880
know i had the rod um and this was in

1346
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:16,239
colorado until i started trimming and i

1347
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,440
was like oh that's when it's really

1348
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:19,439
disappointing because i wasn't even

1349
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,480
anticipating it

1350
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,800
and

1351
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,079
for me it came from corn ear worms corn

1352
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,519
ear worms

1353
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,079
if i understand right i'm trying to

1354
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:30,079
recall is i believe a moth that lay like

1355
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,519
an egg or something and then this thing

1356
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,200
comes it's a caterpillar and the

1357
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:34,639
caterpillar looking thing just goes

1358
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:36,480
around throughout your bud and when it

1359
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,078
does it shits

1360
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,000
and then we have

1361
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,839
the feces from the caterpillar in there

1362
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,679
which creates the rot

1363
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:45,199
um well it's so that was kind of

1364
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:46,719
interesting it wasn't actually this

1365
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:48,159
caterpillar would be like a half inch

1366
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:50,480
long

1367
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:51,358
it going around causing it was actually

1368
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,440
it's

1369
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:55,679
taking a dump my flowers that caused the

1370
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,119
problem i did not have my flowers

1371
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:00,159
protected there's different ways you

1372
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:03,280
could try and handle it um bti bacillus

1373
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:04,480
terengensis subspecies israeli insist is

1374
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,920
a product

1375
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,000
interesting enough though these things

1376
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,440
have become resistant to it on and off

1377
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,838
because everybody uses it and the corn

1378
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,480
earworm usually

1379
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:16,078
affects corn crops but it's found in the

1380
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,440
medicinal plants some of the flower

1381
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,960
structure i don't know if it thinks

1382
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,599
maybe the moths like that looks like a

1383
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,039
corn stalk or not but it messes with it

1384
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,800
and the only way for this one that i

1385
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:27,119
have found maybe when i try to set up a

1386
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,119
grow next season a little bit smaller is

1387
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,880
putting out the fine bug netting that

1388
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,640
you can buy for agricultural purposes

1389
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,680
and therefore these moss and things

1390
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:38,719
cannot fly into your plants

1391
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:41,440
because it's just such a bummer i mean i

1392
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:43,519
and then i did get a little pm

1393
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,800
and there's not a lot you can do i mean

1394
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:46,400
you can grow plants actually i could

1395
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,280
take that back there are plants there

1396
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,838
are

1397
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,680
breeders for different areas

1398
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:55,440
that you might be able to get a strain

1399
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:57,039
that is less susceptible to that type of

1400
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,559
issue i always cite an instance on the

1401
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:00,559
indoor

1402
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:02,000
indoor grow tent back in the day i had

1403
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:03,519
four plants in it

1404
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,239
three of them

1405
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:08,639
completely got pm like it was horrible

1406
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:10,879
and one of them same tent leave share in

1407
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,318
space and never got it i was like this

1408
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,960
is interesting these are all the same

1409
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:16,960
type of plant but different strains and

1410
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,880
this one just won't get it so there's an

1411
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,199
example of

1412
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,800
pm really powdery mildew when i say pm

1413
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:25,679
these other plants

1414
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,680
so it's hard to

1415
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,000
control that a lot there's different

1416
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:31,679
sprays and things you can do for pm you

1417
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,119
got to be on it but man depending on the

1418
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,960
size of your garden

1419
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,720
can really up your labor

1420
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,760
a lot trying to deal with these things

1421
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:42,239
um outside so kind of going back to bud

1422
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,560
rod i had bud rot before indoors and

1423
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:46,799
i'll briefly talk about this yes i uh

1424
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,400
had plants where i decided to do no

1425
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,760
training because i usually do training

1426
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,720
and topping and low stress string and

1427
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,920
all that stuff and i was like you know

1428
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:53,279
what my audience wants to see something

1429
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,680
different let me do no training for the

1430
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,599
beginners who who don't want to train so

1431
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:01,199
i had all these plants and they had nice

1432
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:03,440
real big colas coming up um and

1433
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:05,358
unfortunately my fan died overnight the

1434
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,800
oscillating family i had died overnight

1435
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:08,239
and i only had one fan in there so

1436
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,000
that's a mistake that's one thing going

1437
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:12,159
back always have two fans in your

1438
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,318
environment in case one dies uh that's

1439
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:16,480
something i'm doing moving forward

1440
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:18,159
um but really it

1441
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,079
you know i noticed it

1442
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:21,920
that my fan had to have just been uh

1443
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,760
dead for like 24 hours so there's no air

1444
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,400
movement whatsoever right and the

1445
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,680
humidity skyrocketed uh overnight you

1446
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,519
know i don't i don't remember if i like

1447
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:31,519
just watered the plants that the

1448
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:33,039
previous night or not but

1449
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:34,960
um what i'm trying to say is that the

1450
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:36,558
bud rod happened like pretty much

1451
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,559
overnight now

1452
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,000
once you get bud rod it starts to form

1453
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,359
it starts to form like on the stem and

1454
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,199
then kind of works its way out i'm

1455
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,639
talking about botrytis scenario in

1456
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:46,480
particular

1457
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,078
it'll uh

1458
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,920
it'll continue to grow so although i

1459
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,519
fixed that fan issue i still like two

1460
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,960
more weeks left in the grow

1461
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:54,719
the fans were going i had air movement

1462
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,559
but that botritis that's still there it

1463
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:58,879
doesn't just magically stop growing it

1464
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,960
doesn't matter you just disappear

1465
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,119
so like i got all the way to harvest and

1466
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,039
then i noticed actually that i had

1467
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,760
botrytis i was like what the what the

1468
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:09,920
hell this is terrible it's complete now

1469
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,520
luckily it was only that top main cola

1470
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,559
right the fattest one the lower buds

1471
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:16,480
were fine so like that's typical too

1472
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:19,599
yeah so in that case i just threw away

1473
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:22,079
those colas as had as it was they were

1474
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,519
beautiful and it sucks to take that cola

1475
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,640
and just throw it in the trash but you

1476
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:26,559
gotta do what you gotta do right you

1477
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:28,639
don't wanna be smoking that crap but

1478
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,400
yeah the lower buds were fine in there

1479
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:32,400
but it was uh

1480
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,000
it's not fun it's not fun that air

1481
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,800
movement is important and one other

1482
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,639
thing to mention is you can identify if

1483
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:42,000
bud drops happening if

1484
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:44,000
the leaves coming from the cola if it

1485
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,760
starts to yellow from the bottom of the

1486
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,199
leaf

1487
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,680
that's an indicator that you could

1488
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:52,480
potentially have bud rocks you can um

1489
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:54,879
you notice you'll see some of the little

1490
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,559
leaves coming out of developed flowers

1491
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,318
because this last grow i forgot to

1492
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,839
mention we've been talking outdoor i've

1493
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:04,960
been thinking but indoor my last harvest

1494
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:07,279
i probably lost about not bad maybe 10

1495
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,199
percent from the flowers but you would

1496
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,760
see i could you just be looking around

1497
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:13,838
in the canopy and this unhappy family

1498
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,880
for not family but leaf sticking out of

1499
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:17,279
the flower

1500
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,160
and so a test is to just grab that and

1501
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,920
then if it pulls right out super easy

1502
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:23,759
and then you can see it potentially a

1503
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,599
little bit of dust or whatever you know

1504
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,280
like that area is contaminated and what

1505
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,079
i did for that is i just immediately

1506
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,800
take

1507
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,119
a

1508
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:34,000
just a plastic garbage bag or whatever

1509
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:35,119
over it and then snip below it because

1510
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,519
i'm worried about you don't want and

1511
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,599
turn off all your fans and hope none of

1512
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:41,358
that little dust spreads around anywhere

1513
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,800
but assume you're already gonna be

1514
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:44,400
dealing with it and you're gonna when

1515
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,760
you get the final processing of your

1516
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,760
plants you're gonna run into more of it

1517
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,640
and just be pleasantly surprised if not

1518
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,640
yeah it's not fun at all i and now i

1519
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,239
also another tip is i

1520
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,838
make sure i set up alerts so i use a

1521
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:57,039
sensor push alert i know some people use

1522
00:49:55,838 --> 00:49:59,199
like the pulse

1523
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:01,039
but i have alerts come to my smartphone

1524
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:02,318
if my humidity is too high well i get an

1525
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:04,800
alert on my smartphone i know i need to

1526
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:06,558
go take action so i can see now if the

1527
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,640
fan does die out well i should be

1528
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,880
getting alert yeah but yeah it's not not

1529
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,480
fun at all getting bud rod all right no

1530
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,240
challenges yeah i've got a few other

1531
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,159
good ones here some fun ones here timer

1532
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:18,959
mail function okay so

1533
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:21,199
in uh colorado had four four outdoor

1534
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,159
four or five outdoor grows um and the

1535
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:25,838
first thing i realized i'm gonna need to

1536
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:27,838
eventually because uh the first season i

1537
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:29,199
put no protection over my plants i lived

1538
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:30,400
in an area where every once in a while i

1539
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:33,118
was almost guaranteed we're gonna get

1540
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,800
some hail that comes through um so and i

1541
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,559
could see i was like addicted to i'd sit

1542
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,480
at the computer when i'd see it look at

1543
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,240
uh the weather underground or whatever

1544
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,159
and i'd have the enhanced radar i'd be

1545
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:43,358
like man it's common and i'd be like i

1546
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:44,799
gotta stay home this afternoon no

1547
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:45,679
mountain biking not having umbrellas

1548
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,559
ready

1549
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:50,879
after that season i set up uh what i

1550
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,359
call my tiki grow where i use you can

1551
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,720
get the corrugated uh greenhouse panels

1552
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:55,838
from home depot they're not that

1553
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,159
expensive

1554
00:50:55,838 --> 00:51:00,400
and then i'm not a handy carpenter but i

1555
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:01,598
can rig stuff up and a grow tip here is

1556
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,680
you can get

1557
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,838
two foot long pieces of rebar that are

1558
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:07,679
already pre-cut at home depot and easily

1559
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:09,279
pound that one foot into the ground and

1560
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:12,000
then they sell all kinds of different

1561
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,599
sizes of bamboo but there's bamboo poles

1562
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,599
that were eight foot or maybe ten foot

1563
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:18,000
tall that the bottom diameter of them

1564
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:20,960
were big enough just to slide over that

1565
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,280
rebar and i was like boom now that and

1566
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,838
some green zip ties i'm starting to grow

1567
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,480
plus i want my outdoor grow to look kind

1568
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:30,078
of cool and i thought having a bamboo

1569
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,000
like grow shack over it with some

1570
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:34,000
corrugated plastic panels works great

1571
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,400
and it did it stayed up for like seven

1572
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,239
years so if you can protect your plants

1573
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,760
from even if it's just rain

1574
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:41,358
and weather and figure out how to rig

1575
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,359
something up or even into the structure

1576
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:45,679
that temporarily goes over them you're a

1577
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:46,719
huge advantage there but i'd run into

1578
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:48,879
weather

1579
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:50,399
as far as the challenge here that man

1580
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,160
the sun's going away or was going to get

1581
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,400
too cold and i had spare grow lights

1582
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:56,960
sitting around so i put out two 600

1583
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,400
watts and a thousand watt hps out over

1584
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,318
my outdoor grow

1585
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,559
and then had a timer mail function

1586
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:04,079
coming home at night it's dark out and

1587
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:07,599
in between my house and the neighbor's

1588
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:09,920
house it looks like a ufo's landing like

1589
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,838
luckily at that point i lived on a court

1590
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,159
i knew all the neighbors at that i

1591
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:15,759
wasn't doing uh at that point in time my

1592
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:17,199
garden was allowed i didn't have

1593
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,240
anything to worry about or to get in

1594
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:23,118
trouble for uh but that was just rather

1595
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:25,439
interesting to be like whoa uh

1596
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:27,280
talking about lighting if you if you go

1597
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,358
outside light pollution

1598
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,880
uh does your neighbor have a light that

1599
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:32,558
might shine toward your garden to affect

1600
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,318
its photo period

1601
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:36,720
i had a

1602
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:38,318
street light in front of my house

1603
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:40,000
so i was like oh what am i getting to do

1604
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:41,358
about this because you don't want to

1605
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,880
have light pollution coming in they can

1606
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:44,159
handle some don't get me wrong think

1607
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,318
about how bright it is when a full

1608
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,838
moon's out but for this particular

1609
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:49,759
situation

1610
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:51,199
it's like okay we can't do anything to

1611
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,119
the light that we can't we can't

1612
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:54,399
vandalize the light or do anything to

1613
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,200
the lights

1614
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,200
so i set up a ladder and actually i took

1615
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:00,480
a piece of foil and spray painted it

1616
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:02,078
primer gray

1617
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,679
it looked kind of gray like the light

1618
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,599
and just wrapped the back side of it

1619
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:08,239
that pointed towards my house

1620
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,079
and just used some uh some type of zip

1621
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:11,598
ties i believe that lasted like five

1622
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,119
years as well and my neighbors actually

1623
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,400
like thank you that light used to shine

1624
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,160
into our window

1625
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,440
so be careful of light pollution out

1626
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,639
there anticipate where you're going to

1627
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,159
put your garden are you going to get any

1628
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:22,558
light pollution from your neighbor's

1629
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:24,480
security light or outside lights

1630
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,480
and then it ties into smell man you can

1631
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,519
have some smell from medicinal plants

1632
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,280
and

1633
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:31,920
different you know different strains

1634
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,760
different strengths of smells uh

1635
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,680
my neighbors were cool but also

1636
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,920
sensitive to it at times like that's

1637
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:40,639
getting kind of strong dude

1638
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,318
but you know keep that in mind and you

1639
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:43,679
can do a little research into that into

1640
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:45,440
what which plants might give you more

1641
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:46,558
smell than others at prime times and

1642
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,400
flowering

1643
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,000
um so those would be i don't know it's i

1644
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,639
don't know did you want a little

1645
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
security talk at all or i know that's

1646
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:55,838
good i was going to mention you remind

1647
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,280
me of uh when you talk about the smell

1648
00:53:55,838 --> 00:53:58,799
one time it would mean three of my

1649
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,079
buddies were trimming

1650
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,720
and uh

1651
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:05,760
fedex guy came rang the doorbell and so

1652
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:07,358
i opened up the door and he had to have

1653
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,200
smelled something really strong because

1654
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:11,838
i needed a smile

1655
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:14,000
yeah well no he saw my shirt i had a

1656
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:15,358
gross shirt on he's like oh that's what

1657
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,119
that smell was

1658
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:18,000
and

1659
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,838
so

1660
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,599
so yeah i mean kind of that wraps into

1661
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:23,759
security right if you don't want people

1662
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,519
to um you know know what you're doing

1663
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,119

1664
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:29,358
carpet filters or air

1665
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,559
filtration systems yeah i mean if you

1666
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:31,358

1667
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,119

1668
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:35,199

mailbox and she was like huh and and

00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:42,960
i'm like are you garden at all and she's

1673
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,480

1675
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,679
she's happy so but it was all good yeah

1676
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:52,720
i mean keeping your garden um

1677
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:54,798
out of sight if need be uh

1678
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:56,399
keeping it to where there's not a lot

1679
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:57,759
you can do about smell if the wind's

1680
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,200
going the right direction and you have

1681
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,799
neighbors close by sometimes that's

1682
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:02,879
going to happen you can blame blame

1683
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:04,798
skunks if need be

1684
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,240
but yeah keeping it you know out of

1685
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:09,920
sight and uh secure as possible

1686
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:11,838
things are changing all the time with

1687
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,838
how secure you need to keep it grow and

1688
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:15,519
and it really it's nice to share your

1689
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:16,480
grow if you can

1690
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:17,838
but

1691
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,559
the less people that know the better

1692
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:22,798
it's easy to put things you know out to

1693
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,040
notify you know this day and age with

1694
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:27,280
technology and the affordability of

1695
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:29,039
different cameras or things that can let

1696
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,480
you know hey somebody's in your garden

1697
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:32,079
or maybe even you're catching that can

1698
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,760
tie into animals or pests you know if

1699
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,440
you want to know that something's there

1700
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,040

to eat your plants

1702
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:39,838
you can get other types of pests that

1703
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,358
might come in and really like to eat

1704
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:43,759
your plants but having a notification if

1705
