it along in this video i am by no means

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,879
an expert when it comes to growing

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,200
vegetables only been doing it for about

14
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,879
about three years now mostly outdoors a

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,480
little bit indoors what i'm going to

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,480
show you is indoors i feel like it's

17
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,479
definitely a continuous learning process

18
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,718
when it comes to growing just about any

19
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,398
plant so feedback is welcome down in the

on the right i've got a cut and come

52
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,599
again method i'm doing there so i've got

53
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,519
lettuce on half of the pot and then i

54
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,599
have spinach on the other half of the

55
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,599
pot you can see my sensor push

56
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,599
temperature and humidity monitor is

57
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,640
hanging down there and there's also the

58
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,000
probe for my ac infinity inline fan

59
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,439
that's her as well regulating the

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,598
temperature and i'm getting alerts to my

61
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,199
smartphone when needed by the way sorry

62
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,759
if i sound a little bit congested here

63
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,519
i'm just getting over a sickness i was

64
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,439
sick earlier in the month then it

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,599
started to get better and now i'm back

66
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,318
to being sick again so it kind of came

67
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,479
back which is a super bummer i feel like

68
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,159
it's going away again so i'm thankful on

69
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,639
that avenue i just a little bit

70
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:33,280
congested right now here are the seeds

71
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:36,000
they are all from baker creek we got the

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,640
bloomsdale long standing spinach butter

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,479
crunch lettuce and then bull nose

74
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,479
peppers so these are the varieties that

75
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,399
i'm growing this round in this two foot

76
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,318
by four foot grow tent i've grown up the

77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,640
lettuce and the spinach in the past and

78
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,238
my outdoor garden i have not grown out

79
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,958
the peppers i tried to sprout the

80
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,200
peppers a while ago they didn't actually

81
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,039
sprout but now i'm lucky i have four

82
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,639
here that have sprouted so getting into

83
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,479
the peppers first they're looking pretty

84
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,639
good all of them look healthy they're

85
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,639
all in one gallon containers the medium

86
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,559
is a little bit dry right here but

87
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,000
that's okay i'm just gonna water it it's

88
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,080
also pretty much due for a feeding i'm

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,759
gonna be doing organic nutrients in

90
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,519
these containers so i'm gonna be doing

91
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,199
earth dust nutrients by the green

92
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,200
sunshine company and i'll just top dress

93
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,878
in the nutrients and water them in and

94
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,639
it should be good to go i see a lot of

95
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,799
people growing peppers in one gallon

96
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,639
containers so i figured i'd try out this

97
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,719
container size this time around what

98
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,958
size container do you grow peppers in

99
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,199
let me know also any tips for growing

100
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,719
peppers i did not top these plants i

101
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,439
know a lot of people for peppers they'll

102
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,439
do one topping so they'll get a split

103
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,519
coming out and many claim that that will

104
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,120
achieve a higher yield but i didn't do

105
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,719
any topping this time around just

106
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,640
decided to kind of let them grow

107
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,280
naturally but yeah love to know any

108
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,878
feedback in the comment section below

109
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,719
also would love to know about the

110
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,399
lighting requirements for these plans so

111
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,639
i think these are highlighting

112
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,599
requirements on peppers does anybody

113
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,679
have any details on what the ppfd should

114
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,199
be at the canopy level i would like to

115
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,159
dial in the light distance i think right

116
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:07,359
now i'm doing like 200 300 maybe upwards

117
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:09,679
of 400 ppfd for these plants

118
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,360
and they're on an 18-6 light cycle i

119
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,280
haven't calculated what the dli is on

120
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,280
that but these plants seem to be doing

121
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,879
fine right now but if anybody has any

122
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,478
details on what the light level should

123
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,519
be let me know

124
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,439
these being grown under the es180

125
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,240
v3 led grill light

126
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,560
overkill for these plans in my opinion

127
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,400
uh this is more for medicinal plants i

128
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,839
have this like dimmed all the way down

129
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,638
as low as it could possibly go i think

130
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,719
it's pulling about 32 watts right now so

131
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,360
very very low energy consumption it

132
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,199
doesn't seem like much more is needed

133
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,040
for these particular plants they seem to

134
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,800
be growing pretty good so figure to keep

135
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,040
them at the low light level and yeah i

136
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,199
think future stay would be for me to

137
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,759
swap out this light for something a bit

138
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,240
cheaper and i think this light is a 400

139
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,080
light and this just isn't needed for

140
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,519
vegetables i was using them all my

141
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,519
medicinal plants and kind of lying

142
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,560
around so i figured i'd use it let's

143
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,038
move on to the lettuce and spinach i

144
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,959
have them in a seven gallon container

145
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,279
fox from ocean forest oil i'll be

146
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,319
amending these with organic nutrients i

147
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,719
believe i'm going to be going with the

148
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,759
earth dust nutrients for this as well

149
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,520
spinach is not coming in as nicely as i

150
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,319
would like it to i'm not sure if it's

151
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,159
just

152
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,519
the container size it's in how it's kind

153
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,000
of cluttered

154
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,918
not getting good leaf growth there so i

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,759
don't know if i'm gonna continue to have

156
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,758
spinach in this container or not the

157
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,759
lettuce looks fine i've actually already

158
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,680
harvested the lettuce i'm gonna continue

159
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,038
to harvest this lettuce and like i

160
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,120
mentioned before i'm doing the cut and

161
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,560
come again method so just kind of

162
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,079
cutting off the tops

163
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,319
working my way around the container

164
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,719
harvesting as i need it right so if i

165
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,399
want a salad tonight i will cut up just

166
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,080
enough that i would need for my salad

167
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,239
and leave the rest so i'm happy with how

168
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,599
the lettuce is looking not so happy with

169
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,600
how the spinach is looking i'm probably

170
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,600
going to kill that off i have grown both

171
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,160
of these plants outdoors in the past and

172
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,400
i got some great results outdoors the

173
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,120
spinach was going fine outdoors but here

174
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,560
indoors maybe it's just in too close of

175
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,280
a container everything's so cluttered in

176
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,519
this container that's probably a gut

177
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,038
feeling on why that's happening but i

178
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,038
it's all good got a little bit there to

179
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,719
harvest i'll definitely eat that up and

180
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,879
i'll probably fill up the rest container

181
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,560
with uh just lettuce just do the whole

182
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,159
thing as being lettuce maybe i'll get

183
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,478
another variety of lettuce and have it

184
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,360

185
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,719

186
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,800
