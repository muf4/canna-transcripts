1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,720
coming up on garden talk did you know

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,640
that plant roots

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:08,080
can like hear water

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:11,599
and also

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,440
plants have a memory every color

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,160
penetrates and gets captured by the

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,320
plant differently you'll get more sites

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,640
that can get more light so you're

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,000
getting more photosynthesis the leaves

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,519
are getting bigger capturing more and

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,518
you're getting more nodes hitting to

12
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,518
where there is light his studies show

13
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:30,399
that infrared in the presence of other

14
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:34,079
colors does cause photosynthesis

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:36,640
i don't really like dli for indoor just

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,719
because it's so hard to calculate i

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,878
think we're trying to do as humans is

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,960
pinpoint one thing about the plant and

19
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,119
just say we know what happens when

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,719
really there's every color is something

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,718
different there's different systems in

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,000
the plant there's different receptors

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,000
all sorts of things going on

24
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,399

some new information as well a lot of

92
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,719
you may know dan from the green sunshine

93
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,239
company i've been running his lights

94
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,719
since they first came out i think it was

95
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,719
like 2018 i believe i've been running

96
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:32,318
the es 300 and also the es 180 they had

97
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,158
multiple versions of those lights which

98
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:37,598
i'm sure we'll get into later on you

99
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:40,079
know the v1 v2 now it's on the v3

100
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:42,000
version uh awesome awesome light and

101
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,080
then you also may know him from a couple

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,598
videos we did together so

103
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,239
we did most recently it was probably

104
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,079
about a year ago now we did an episode

105
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,599
on just a quick video talking about

106
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,159
security cameras

107
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,399
they they uh emit ir light so big

108
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,000
question was is that impact plant growth

109
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,560
so that one actually did really well for

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
21 000 views on that one and then the

111
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,560
one one before that was at uh mj biz con

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
where we did uh kind of a sit down there

113
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,519
and we talked about lighting and

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,759
different spectrum and how it impacts

115
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,879
plant growth and so on and so forth that

116
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,159
got over 193 000 views so that one

117
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,478
really popped off so you're pretty

118
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,000
pretty famous about those two videos

119
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,639
i'm sure uh there's quite a few people

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,079
who know you are so but let's get into

121
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,840
uh for those that don't know who you are

122
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,039
how about an introduction can you tell

123
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,879
us a little bit about yourself and kind

124
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,439
of how you got into gardening

125
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:34,000
yeah well my name is dan i founded the

126
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,240
green sunshine company uh in my living

127
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,478
room in basement

128
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,240
like five or six years ago

129
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:44,079
and i

130
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,680
i didn't really uh intend to get into

131
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,359
uh lighting or nutrients or anything

132
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,840
that we're into now

133
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,600
uh you know really i just kind of

134
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,519
knew i liked gardening and that started

135
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,960
with my grandfather he always had a

136
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:59,439
tomato garden in his backyard tomatoes

137
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,120
uh he was all he was feeding me uh juice

138
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,800
i don't know if you guys ever had uh

139
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,399
vegetable juice but he was always like

140
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,879
here daniel you know they called me

141
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,839
daniel when i was a kid you know carrot

142
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,918
juice or celery juice and that's carried

143
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:15,439
with me for a long time so that was a

144
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:18,000
good imprint um and then my grandma

145
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,918
actually uh was was uh she was like a

146
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,759
apple expert if you think about grandma

147
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,478
computer expert so i got this like

148
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,759
technical and gardening thing that fused

149
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,199
together

150
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,280
but you know really i didn't garden

151
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:33,439
myself for a while um until i was living

152
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,319
in a tropical state

153
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,279
and

154
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,759
i

155
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,359
i was hanging out at a bar

156
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,120
and this story is kind of how i got

157
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,199
started and like you know i'm talking

158
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,918
with this guy and he like invites me up

159
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,240
to is to his apartment to like see his

160
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,680
garden and i'm like and it's nighttime

161
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,840
so i'm just like

162
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,519
okay i didn't know anyone

163
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,079
in the town and i was like you know i

164
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,719
just go see whatever this guy's garden

165
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,800

166
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,759
something illegal at the time

167
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,360
but it was not it was legitimately he

168
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,560
just showed me his balcony nighttime

169
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,000
garden um we tried he had like peppers

170
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,560
tomatoes

171
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,439
um you know and then he had uh what else

172
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,879
he had he had like a um

173
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,719
i forget what you call it it's that

174
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,719
fruit where you you eat it and like it

175
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,120
goes like your your mouth can only taste

176
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,639
sweet instead of sour

177
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,120
there's like that there's a special

178
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,800
fruit that does that anyways he had that

179
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,720
and you know that can that kind of

180
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,720
opened my eyes to the fact like oh like

181
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,039
you can you know garden on your balcony

182
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,880
so i tried it with some

183
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,159
peppers didn't work out too good i

184
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,759
started reading square foot gardening

185
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,520
and when i

186
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,759
you know went to the oregon i had some

187
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,359
yard space and i was able to

188
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,680
unsuccessfully

189
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,160
grow outdoors for a while

190
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,120
uh eventually i got pretty good at it

191
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,080
and

192
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,720
um i've been doing that for

193
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,800
um like

194
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,400
like maybe a decade i've been kind of

195
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,240
pumping around with

196
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,120
outdoor gardening and then i went

197
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,720
indoors about

198
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,840
i don't know the number of years maybe

199
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,080
six or seven became legal in oregon and

200
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,918
i needed to grow for my family and

201
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,199
that's kind of when i started doing the

202
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:19,519
indoor stuff

203
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,720
and then my little technical mind got

204
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,758
into lighting

205
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,560
um way back in the day if if you if you

206
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,639
uh

207
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,160
uh look at the wikipedia article for

208
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,319
photosynthesis

209
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,639
i actually was angry because everyone

210
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,800
was saying that red and blue light

211
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,519
was the only thing that plants used

212
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,478
and i was like no they use green

213
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,399
they use infrared like i've seen the

214
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,159
plant studies like

215
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,598
it works guys and like way back in the

216
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,960
day we finally got over the red and blue

217
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,839
pump uh bright red and blue uh

218
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:51,918
hump

219
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,478
and then uh recently we're getting over

220
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,560
the infrared uh bump so

221
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,959
uh and like that's basically how i start

222
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,839
with the electric sky is i found what i

223
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,439
thought was the best spectrum we use

224
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,359
custom diodes

225
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,959
uh that creates a smooth response and

226
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,439
that's kind of how

227
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,598
i started in my gardening career and

228
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,759
then we went on to we made earth dust

229
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,279
that's our other product so that's it

230
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,000
start to finish you know i started with

231
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:20,159
my grandfather and then some random guy

232
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,560
in a tropical state showed me his

233
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,720
balcony garden and i started growing

234
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,280
outdoors indoors and then now here we

235
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,280
are that's awesome yeah like i mentioned

236
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,598
uh to begin as you know we've known each

237
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:35,038
other since 2018 i believe is when we

238
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:37,360
first 2017 i think it was at mj viscom

239
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,559
yeah that was cool yeah i remember

240
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,240
yeah it was like it was like one of

241
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,718
those things like you see like a famous

242
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,200
person because you see my video like hey

243
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,680
i know you you know and then like no i

244
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,879
don't and then yeah so it was one of

245
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,479
those things so uh yeah it was fun

246
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,759
and now you're the famous one you've got

247
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,360
a youtube channel now which i'll

248
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,278
actually link it down in the youtube

249
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,039
description section below um the green

250
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:00,240
sunshine company tell us a little bit

251
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,079
about what you have on the channel i

252
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,399
mean there's a ton of information on

253
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,320
lighting and also how to grow as well

254
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,559
right exactly yeah we have a just did a

255
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,640
how to grow series from start to finish

256
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,559
we did two live broadcasts or a few live

257
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,480
broadcasts we did live q and a so we've

258
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,479
got one with earth dust

259
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,000
and then one that's broken up that's not

260
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,080
about our duster

261
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,320
electric's got it brings you through the

262
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,759
entire process of growing or at least

263
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,080
how we do it

264
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,759
uh so if you're just looking for a guide

265
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,839
of where to begin especially if you're

266
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,919
using our products you can use that

267
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,959
and then we have a bunch of ones like

268
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:37,278
unearth dust because really like the i

269
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:40,399
recently got really into the science of

270
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:42,080
growing in soil and how that works so uh

271
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,080
we were not talking about that today but

272
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,800
you know we could talk a lot about you

273
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,560
know bacteria and fungi and the

274
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:53,039
mycorrhizal forms and all that so uh but

275
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,559
today is about lighting um i actually i

276
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,240
should be covering a lot in this

277
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,399
interview that

278
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,959
i haven't really covered uh in any of my

279
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,278
other videos before so letting it all

280
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,799
out on this one sweet some exclusive

281
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,278
material

282
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,479
man so let's start with the basics uh

283
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:09,519
i'm going to ask you a very basic

284
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,600
question but i'm sure it's going to have

285
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,159
a very complex answer which is well

286
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,200
probably

287
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:19,759
how do plants interact with light

288
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,120
that's the age-old question right

289
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,200
um

290
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,519
before i answer that question did you

291
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,440
know that plant roots

292
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,200
can like hear water

293
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,200
you know they like go towards it they

294
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,560
can like hear they've done studies about

295
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,079
this it's crazy

296
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:38,000
and also

297
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:41,120
plants uh have like a memory

298
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,240
they do like they they will remember

299
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,000
like sounds and air movements and

300
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,159
react in certain ways so they're way

301
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,600
smarter than you think probably smarter

302
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:53,278
than you and they're probably so smart

303
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,519
they don't even know it so light is just

304
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,120
something totally different and it's uh

305
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,159
it's amazing because you know we can

306
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,759
measure light sense like we can uh take

307
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,600
the light and put it on top of the plant

308
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,879
side the plants change the color change

309
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,360
the intensity

310
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,320
uh it's it's kind of like our way of

311
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,959
really

312
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,000
interacting with how the plant works

313
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,518
and uh really this this started to

314
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,320
accelerate

315
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,919
when leds came out because finally

316
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,720
and you know instead of taking like you

317
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,240
know old stage lighting gels and like

318
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,959
changing the color that way you know we

319
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,839
can we can identify you know led

320
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:32,078
wavelengths you know and that's actually

321
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,079
right around when leds came out they

322
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:36,399
could only make red and blue

323
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,719
uh that correlated with uh one of our

324
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,879
plant studies that uh recognizes what

325
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,920
chlorophyll absorbs just absorbed which

326
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:46,159
is red and blue so they're like hey

327
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,399
leds make red and blue really good look

328
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,120
at this we got a chlorophyll graph and

329
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,078
look

330
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,320
bam

331
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:53,919
it can grow therefore plants only use

332
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,160
red and blue light like that's where

333
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,599
purple led lights came from so if you're

334
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,519
ever wondering how on earth did we get

335
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,920
all these purple id led grill lights it

336
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,320
was a combination of technology and our

337
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,120
limited understanding at the time

338
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,680
of being able to really adjust that

339
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,519
so uh when i started

340
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,838
you know as you mentioned as i mentioned

341
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,159
before i saw the photosynthetically

342
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,920
active radiation guide in wikipedia it

343
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,000
was like my red and blue lights and i

344
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:22,399
think i put in there like plants use

345
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,480
green light to grow because we have this

346
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,120
range called par right which is the

347
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,480
photosynthetic reactive range

348
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,839
uh so

349
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,039
that was one of my first kind of

350
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,200
breakthroughs i was thinking that you

351
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,679
know green light you know it's not

352
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,519
picked up by chlorophyll but it does get

353
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,359
absorbed by the plant

354
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,879
um you know and but it's used for

355
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,159
photosynthesis and

356
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,559
really like

357
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,719
i think we're trying to do as humans is

358
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,799
pinpoint one thing about the plant and

359
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,399
just say we know what happens when

360
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:51,919
really there is

361
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,600
every color is something different

362
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,599
there's different systems in the plant

363
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,278
there's different receptors all sorts of

364
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,240
things going on

365
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:59,679
so

366
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,759
if you want to disregard everything that

367
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,479
i just said i'm going to break this down

368
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,480
for you uh with a with a i actually did

369
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,320
a video about this called planks how

370
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,759
plants use light i'll break it down

371
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,399
right now and add some a little extra

372
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,200
information so how do plants use light

373
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,720
uh

374
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,200
there's a three-step way to remember

375
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,800
this it's uh c

376
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,440
p r

377
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,639
like you know resuscitating somebody

378
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,680
cpr

379
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,759
uh it stands for capture photosynthesis

380
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,759
react so that's the three ways plants

381
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,759
interact with light so if you want to

382
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,278
stay with me this can be a longer answer

383
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,078
i'll give some more information of what

384
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:37,759
i've learned since that video and add

385
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:39,519
into the interview now so first is

386
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:40,879
capture

387
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,720
obviously

388
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,559
for plants to do anything

389
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,040
with the light it has to capture it has

390
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:49,119
to get into the plant so how does that

391
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,639
work well if you think about you know a

392
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,000
plant going like this is growing

393
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,839
branches out

394
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,159
you know it's growing leaves for the

395
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,480
vegetative process it's growing it's

396
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,278
seeking out where light comes from and

397
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,120
it's making a structure right so that's

398
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,360
how it captures light so

399
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,120
obviously how how big the area like the

400
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,560
leaves how big they are

401
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,159
that's how much light it can capture

402
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,198
everything else is not hitting the plant

403
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,799
is not

404
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:16,559
not getting used uh and another thing to

405
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,919
think about is direction

406
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,278
right a lot of people don't think about

407
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,799
this you know there's a lot of videos

408
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,958
out there where people are testing grow

409
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,399
lights by just taking a plant meter and

410
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,239
going like this and only seeing the

411
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,919
light that comes from above but really

412
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,320
light is bouncing around it's getting

413
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,159
under the plant and the plant is a 3d

414
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,320
object right so if you measure the light

415
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,399
output from up at top here it's not

416
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,720
going to be the same down here at all

417
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,039
it's a 3d object and light's coming from

418
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,560
multiple directions so you've got all

419
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:46,078
this different capturing going on so

420
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:47,919
it's really you know again where the

421
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,198
planet is the direction of the light if

422
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,078
it's getting in between the leaves or

423
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:51,838
not

424
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,439
and the last thing is color this is

425
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,360
really fascinating

426
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,040
you probably don't know this but every

427
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,959
color

428
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,639
penetrates and gets captured by the

429
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,838
plant differently

430
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,440
uh so

431
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,600
let me do like a little cross-section of

432
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,800
a leaf right here so pretend the leaf is

433
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,320
like in in here so a red and blue light

434
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,599
will actually mostly get blocked

435
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,278
especially narrow band leds the hits of

436
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,759
red blue light usually hits the top

437
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,519
layer of the the leaf zone stops

438
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,600
so if all of your light is concentrated

439
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,198
on the red and blue this top layer will

440
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,240
be like

441
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,759
just absorb like glowing with light and

442
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,120
the wrestle will be pretty dark so what

443
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,039
will happen if that's why those red and

444
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,278
blue lights give you a

445
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:35,198
plant what is it called photo bleaching

446
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,838
a lot because that narrow brand red

447
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:40,479
never been blue are concentrated getting

448
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,279
absorbed in a really small area

449
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,360
of cells so those cells get overworked

450
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:47,600
so that's why those peaks even though

451
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,919
it's really efficient uh you know you

452
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,079
can cheat on uh making a garlic really

453
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,599
efficient by using those you know to the

454
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,078
plant it's going to absorb the top right

455
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,879
here now if you think about other colors

456
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:01,278
like green yellow those will penetrate a

457
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:04,159
little deeper into the leaf so this is

458
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:06,559
just the leaf and it's glowing more of

459
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,958
the leaf and when you get to infrared

460
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,479
infrared will actually go through the

461
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,119
entire leaf

462
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,320
so it's it's it's capturing it's hitting

463
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,679
actually more of the planet because you

464
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,680
think about there's another leaf down

465
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,838
here that's going to be getting green

466
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,278
and infrared so it's capturing it in

467
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,399
multiple different

468
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:27,919
ways so that's c capture so we've got

469
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,440
it's 3d got direction and color okay so

470
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:33,198
c now we're on to p

471
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,880
photosynthesis so cpr p photosynthesis

472
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,719
we just did capture i want you to stay

473
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,799
with me so p

474
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,879
stands for photosynthesis now how does

475
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:43,120
photosynthesis happen

476
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,120
uh well if you don't know about plants

477
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,039
they use water right

478
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,000
and use air

479
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:52,000
and light to to make all the magic

480
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,120
happen so they're they're bringing up

481
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,519
water

482
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,839
to the leaves and something amazing

483
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,078
happens in the leaves where you heard

484
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,000
about plants breathing you know they're

485
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:05,759
they're making co2 and oxygen so what's

486
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,519
happening is they're splitting water out

487
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,640
oxygen and hydrogen

488
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,798
i don't know how that part works and

489
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,679
then they make something called atp

490
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,838
which is an energy source okay

491
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,319
there's actually two specific things in

492
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,838
the plant to call two photo systems that

493
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:21,918
do this in the plant that's how

494
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:24,558
photosynthesis works so if you want to

495
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,240
sound really smart you can you can say i

496
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,879
know how the two photo systems of the

497
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,798
plant works splits water

498
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,480
to make energy and makes this chemical

499
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:35,519
called atp

500
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,319
and that's how photosynthesis works and

501
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:41,918
here's how it interacts with light um

502
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:43,839
and it relates to dr bugbee's uh you

503
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,919
know recent findings with infrared of

504
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,639
why infrared is important so there's two

505
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:52,640
photo systems right and they're first

506
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,960
discovered by a man uh named dr emerson

507
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,280
so dr emerson was like hey man like i

508
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,919
know we got this par range which is just

509
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:02,160
blue to red but if i give a plant

510
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,080
infrared light and red light it like

511
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,600
gets this boost and growth that's

512
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,000
greater than the two it's like one plus

513
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:10,079
one equals three instead of two uh

514
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
usually not that dramatic but you know

515
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,079
that was the emerson effect and the

516
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,119
reason for that is you have photo system

517
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,798
one and photo system two so photo system

518
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:20,159
two i call the engine

519
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,558
and photo system one i call the

520
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,160
supercharger so if you think about a car

521
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,160
so if you just turn on the supercharger

522
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,960
nothing's gonna happen which is

523
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,240
infrared light if you turn on the engine

524
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,960
well something's going to happen even

525
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,720
without the supercharger so

526
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,440
photo system one supercharger photo

527
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,480
system two engine and what the engine

528
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,320
does it absorbs blue through red

529
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,640
and then the supercharger does is it

530
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:47,439
absorbs uh red through up through

531
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,520
infrared okay so that's why if you give

532
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,880
it both things it's going to work the

533
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,798
engine is going to work better more

534
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,520
growth and they're linked together first

535
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,599
one splits water second one makes atp

536
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,038
but this one flows into this one

537
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,199
automatically so that's why you don't

538
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,400
need infrared but if you give infrared

539
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,519
to the plant

540
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,880
it

541
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,798
makes the growth

542
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,960
go easier quicker with the two photo

543
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,879
systems so just remember

544
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,960
photo system one photo system two photo

545
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,640
system one the supercharger four system

546
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,480
two that engine

547
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,400
blue to red and this one goes through

548
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,400
infrared and that's why the emerson

549
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,280
effect works and that's why the par

550
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,559
range is outdated which we'll get to a

551
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,038
little later but the power range was

552
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:29,359
made in 1970.

553
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:32,079
yeah so we did c we did p and now we're

554
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,038
into r which is uh they react so plants

555
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,359
react

556
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:38,480
the two ways they most generally

557
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:40,719
react is to intensity and color

558
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,400
a lot of people don't realize the

559
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,558
intensity actually will can determine

560
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,160
how big the plant gets so if you get

561
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,599
a low intensity light they'll get

562
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,679
stretchy right if you have high

563
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,199
intensity they'll they'll stay compacted

564
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,759
down that's why

565
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,759
in veg i like to have my life far away

566
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,200
at a high brightness because what will

567
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:01,038
happen is that plant will stay bushier

568
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,200
and you know i'll get into this little

569
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:05,119
later but you get kind of more of a

570
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,200
wilder room with play because light

571
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,798
light dynamics are more even when the

572
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,360
lights further away like the sun but

573
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:13,759
anyways they react to intensity the

574
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:15,199
second thing they react to is color and

575
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,119
we'll get into more of this later but

576
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,279
the makeup of the spectrum

577
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:21,519
you know really matters with

578
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:24,879
how the shape it grows the yield that

579
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:28,079
grows the the types of compounds it

580
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,440
produces the color all matters

581
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:34,079
so just to recap c p r capture

582
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,038
photosynthesis react that's how plants

583
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,798
interact with flight now how about

584
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:41,200
photoreceptors what are those and how is

585
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:43,038
plant growth impacted by them

586
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,600
yeah photoreceptors it's basically a

587
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,359
plant's way of seeing like with their

588
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:50,158
eyes a certain color

589
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,839
or a combination of colors so that's

590
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,760
really what they are and then there are

591
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,798
two types of photoreceptors is that

592
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,359
right

593
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:59,918
there are a few uh

594
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:02,240
there's a for blue light i mean notes i

595
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:07,120
don't remember them all but there's uh

596
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:10,480
cryptochromes phytotropins ztl fk f1

597
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,359
lkp2 now i don't know what all these do

598
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,558
but

599
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:14,959
there's a lot

600
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,399
with blue light and uva light where they

601
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,880
can sense that

602
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,200
a good way to kind of visualize this in

603
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,240
your head is if you give a plant no blue

604
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,558
light

605
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,319
it will not think that there's any light

606
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:29,279
around so if you just

607
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:31,200
made a grow light no blue light

608
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,639
it's going to stretch extraordinarily

609
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,640
because it's not going to have that

610
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,520
signal that it normally gets that

611
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,159
here is the presence of light

612
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,400
it's going to want to stretch

613
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,320
so if you add blue light it's going to

614
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,559
say okay this is the direction of where

615
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,240
the light is coming from and also if you

616
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,960
the more blue light you add generally

617
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,120
speaking the tighter uh internal spacing

618
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,200
the plant has the smaller the leaves get

619
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:57,119
so it makes the plant more compact so

620
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,600
that's an example of

621
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,879
one photoreceptor system

622
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,959
um

623
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,760
and the second one that's that's pretty

624
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,679
common is the phytochrome system which

625
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,679
is like the biological on and off slip

626
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,559
so if you ever wondered how your plants

627
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,759
uh know its bedtime

628
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:15,599
well

629
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,879
it's a phytochrome system and here's how

630
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,000
it works it's actually really really

631
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,880
cool so

632
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,400
uh it's called uh there's p and and then

633
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,480
uh pfr

634
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,200
which you know uh i'm gonna get into it

635
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,159
but

636
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,840
there's a far red one and a red one okay

637
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,760
so i want you to visualize the lights

638
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,798
are on in your grow room

639
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,960
the red tank gets full okay and now the

640
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:40,558
lights go off click

641
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,319
and then this is what happens

642
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:44,079
over a period about two hours and then

643
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,639
this gets full

644
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:48,480
and what that means is the planet goes

645
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,159
it's nighttime because this chemical

646
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,480
reaction occurred so

647
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,120
red far right over two hours and we can

648
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,440
actually do is daytime lights turn off

649
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:00,479
you can you can give the plant just far

650
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,960
red and the switch happens sooner so

651
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,200
i've seen research where people can give

652
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,000
the plant a ton of far red light and

653
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,919
reduce the darkness period because this

654
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,839
reaction actually needs to occur for

655
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,559
about 10 hours for the plant to realize

656
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,678
hey

657
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,240
it's nighttime that's why you need that

658
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,480
12 hours of off so hypothetically if you

659
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,679
sped this up you could get away with 11

660
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,360
13

661
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,679
hours but it's i don't think it's that

662
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,199
reliable so it's like kind of one of

663
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,600
those things so

664
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,840
and this also that what it does it

665
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,359
detects the amount of red and infrared

666
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:33,439
in the environment and i'll get into

667
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:36,399
this later but that's that system that

668
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,000
does that so uh if i just described the

669
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,320
two main groups of photo systems like

670
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,798
the blue and the red and the infrared

671
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,000
infrared okay now

672
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:46,879
there's another thing i want to throw at

673
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,480
you there's a way to bypass both of them

674
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,440
to give the planet color that i can't

675
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,038
even detect which is green light

676
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,720
so that's

677
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:56,158
why in the beginning of planet science

678
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,079
people are like well i go in my grow

679
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,600
room with a green light on

680
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,599
it doesn't wake them up

681
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,359
therefore plants don't use green light

682
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,199
they just use uh red and blue like that

683
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,038
was kind of like a thing in people's

684
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,400
people's heads but really you're just

685
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,200
bypassing

686
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,519
the photoreceptors of the plant it'll

687
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,360
ironically absorb it use it for

688
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,480
photosynthesis but you're bypassing the

689
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,158
red and blue and the uh yeah you're

690
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,319
practicing the blue and the red and far

691
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,679
red with the green light so that's why

692
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:25,918
you can go in your

693
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,759
grow room at night the green headlamp

694
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,080
and it's not waking up the plant because

695
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,839
it's blind to it even though it uses it

696
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:34,158
for growth so that's something

697
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,480
fascinating about photoreceptors in the

698
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,679
plant you mentioned a few light cycles

699
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,839
there and i want to get a little bit

700
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,200
deeper into it now so

701
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,639
some people give zero hours of darkness

702
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,919
right they run their hour they run their

703
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,080
grow like 24 hours a day other folks you

704
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,320
know for veg stage some people do 18

705
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:55,119
hours on six hours off some people do 20

706
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:56,399
hours on four hours off for veg and then

707
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,599
when they go to flower there's a couple

708
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,840
different life cycles that people

709
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:03,038
traditionally do which is 12 hours on 12

710
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:04,639
hours off or 11 hours on

711
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,879
13 hours off

712
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,440
what light cycles for veg and flower do

713
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,000
you generally recommend and why

714
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,720
yeah that's a great question um

715
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,759
the plant research i've seen when plants

716
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,000
get damaged they need a

717
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,200
they need an off time to recover you

718
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,359
know plants

719
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,278
uh they switch between you know what

720
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,879
they're exhaling and inhaling when the

721
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:28,400
lights are on versus when the lights are

722
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,278
off and

723
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,278
uh i'm not an expert on this but there

724
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:36,319
are different flows in the plant that

725
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,759
occur when the lights are off so

726
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,359
in my mind

727
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:40,240
uh unless

728
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,278
you're

729
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,400
like a super pro you know the

730
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:47,679
the

731
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,278
zero works for you that dark period is a

732
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,519
time for recovery

733
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,319
and you know reorganizing of the plant

734
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:54,079
and

735
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:59,038
so it can be healthier with that off

736
00:25:54,079 --> 00:26:00,960
period of time so 18 on six off for veg

737
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,599
is what i'd recommend

738
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,640
for flower 1212 is pretty standard if

739
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:06,558
you want to

740
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,720
play around with infrared you can maybe

741
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:11,119
shave an hour off of your nighttime

742
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,558
cycle to give it more dli during the day

743
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:15,599
and really the only reason you need the

744
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:18,000
12 hours off is because of that

745
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,240
time when the plant needs to think it's

746
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,240
you know it's fall time so that's why

747
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,960
that 12 hours off is necessary the on

748
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,720
time really doesn't matter so much um

749
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,679
and then in terms of autoflowers you

750
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,120
know

751
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,919
a 18 on six off 20 and four

752
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:35,678
can be can be helpful because

753
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,720
you know you don't need it doesn't have

754
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:41,038
that sensing to make the flowers

755
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,880
happen so it does not sense night and

756
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,558
day that's why autoflowers you can kind

757
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,400
of move through the cycle i'm not an

758
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,960
expert on autoflowers but

759
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,320
uh that's a whole another like topic of

760
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,159
niche i believe you have some videos

761
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,678
about it so go watch somewhere to grow

762
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,679
up videos about autoflowers you want to

763
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,759
know how that works but we're generally

764
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,400
speaking normal photo period plant which

765
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:03,599
senses night and day 18 on six off for

766
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,880
veg and then 12 12 for flower okay

767
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:07,759
gotcha

768
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,278
i want to talk about measuring light um

769
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,720
there's different ways to measure light

770
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:12,400
right some people will get a par meter

771
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,159
and they're like oh measure the par and

772
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,840
they think that's it right they go after

773
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,000
that number and that's all but there are

774
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:19,678
different ways to measure light

775
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,679
talk to us about that in terms of like

776
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,000
color and wavelengths

777
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,360
yeah yeah so

778
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,319
there's a lot of different light

779
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:30,479
measurements out there and they gets

780
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,398
very confusing so

781
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,599
uh i want to break down the different

782
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:35,199
types and then we'll talk about the

783
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,599
color so

784
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,880
first there's the color output that you

785
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:41,199
are measuring

786
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,520
so when we say par what that means is

787
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,240
red to blue okay so that's just the

788
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,038
range of colors you're measuring

789
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,278
and

790
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,038
the range of colors of par was defined

791
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:52,960
in 1970s

792
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,480
limited limited plant research okay

793
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,079
we'll give that a little bit then

794
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,839
there's this then there's the total

795
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,639
output of the light

796
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:04,319
which is uh pp which is pdf which is

797
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,759
photon output and then you have ppfd

798
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,558
which is

799
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:11,119
density at a spot so there's ppf which

800
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:14,000
is total output and then ppfd which is

801
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:17,519
at a certain spot and ppfd can actually

802
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,278
be quite misleading because

803
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,038
a planet is 3d

804
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:22,960
and especially if you have a bar light

805
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:24,558
and like the ideal range is about six

806
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,319
inches away and you're getting great

807
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:27,839
numbers you move that down a little bit

808
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,720
that number is going to change quite a

809
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:33,278
bit so it's very difficult to really get

810
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,880
a good handle on what the plant is

811
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:37,359
actually using because you think of a

812
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,720
giant cola that's here you know you

813
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:43,199
might get 1200 here and then 600 here so

814
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,278
ppfd measurements are very difficult

815
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,600
it's best to kind of

816
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:48,880
know the maximum of what the the plan is

817
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,918
getting so

818
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,320
so again it's color output the total

819
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,480
output and then the spot measurement

820
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,240
um and those all have different acronyms

821
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,440
and then if you think about the colors

822
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,759
there's par

823
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,440
and then dr bugbee

824
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,158
is doing some very important research

825
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,640
about infrared and his studies show that

826
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,440
infrared in the presence of other colors

827
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,159
does cause photosynthesis at the same or

828
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,840
greater rate than other colors so now we

829
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,440
have a decision to make

830
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:19,519
do we make a new metric and the answer

831
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,038
is yes and that's called extended power

832
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:22,960
which is e par

833
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:26,720
so e p a r

834
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,480
and that is 400 blue to about 750 which

835
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,399
is in the infrared range

836
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,798
uh and then the metric that we use which

837
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:35,599
was kind of like before

838
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:37,200
uh epar was released there's a time when

839
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,558
everyone is just going crazy with these

840
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,440
but uh but it's coming out like e par is

841
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,960
blue through infrared and then you have

842
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,159
uh b par

843
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,360
or p bar i've seen it both ways which is

844
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,440
biologically bio

845
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:56,319
photobiologically active radiation which

846
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,558
is the colors that affect plants not the

847
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:01,439
colors that actually cause growth so

848
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:04,240
that is you lead it to infrared

849
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,399
so and that's like 300 to like 780 or

850
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,558
something so again power

851
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:12,398
1970s old 400 to 700 that's what most uh

852
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:15,918
uh parameters will give you then the e

853
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:17,918
power which is new 400 to about 750 and

854
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,320
then b par which is

855
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,038
all the colors that affect the plant 300

856
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:25,439
to about 800 which is a wider range so

857
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:26,960
there you go those are the three it's

858
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,880
like it's like a grid you know you've

859
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,319
got the titan you've got the types they

860
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,600
got the colors and there's all different

861
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:33,439
acronyms so

862
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,839
um yeah you could do

863
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,960
what we call instead of ppfd for

864
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:42,158
biological bpfd so i think with epar it

865
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,079
would be like e ppfd i don't know

866
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,399
so

867
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:49,439
there's so much there's so many i think

868
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:52,798
most people just go after par or or dli

869
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,640
right yeah how much par or dli do you

870
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:56,879
typically recommend for medicinal

871
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,519
varieties yeah during the different

872
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,200
stages of growth yeah um

873
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,399
i don't really like

874
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,080
dli or indoor just because

875
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,639
it's so hard to calculate as i said

876
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,439
before plants are 3d you know

877
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,278
and

878
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,360
the majority of your plant is not the

879
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:14,240
top the majority of it is like halfway

880
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:16,798
down

881
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,640
or or further and if you think about

882
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:20,398
measuring dli outside makes a lot more

883
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,000
sense because if you take a parameter

884
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,518
raise it up above your head hold it at

885
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,519
your chest it's going to be the same

886
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,200
because the sun is very far away but

887
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,278
indoors if your gorilla is here you're

888
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,798
going to get all different numbers going

889
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:32,960
through here so if you if you calculate

890
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:35,440
calculated dli here well what if you're

891
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,360
growing bushy plants well then you gotta

892
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,159
you gotta map it out totally differently

893
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:40,558
so

894
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,640
that kind of just you know

895
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:43,839
i like to kind of say hey you know throw

896
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,399
out the window

897
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:48,720
maybe maybe look at the par output of

898
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:49,759
the light instead the ppf rating

899
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,440
um

900
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:53,679
and so

901
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,440
to get to give a solid answer it's

902
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,200
really the maximums that you're that

903
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,120
you're looking for

904
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,840
when when you're dealing with a with a

905
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:04,239
with a plant so and and the ppfd is more

906
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:07,439
the intensity that it can handle so in

907
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,640
vegas or uh early veg like 200 to 400

908
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,600
ppfd

909
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,480
then in veg that's about four to six

910
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,798
then a flower it's eight to a thousand

911
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,079
and that's generally the intensity that

912
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,079
it can take

913
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,158
now a trick is

914
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:23,759
as i said before

915
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,159
the distance matters so if you have a

916
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,480
light that's this close and you get 200

917
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,840
pp of d that is actually getting quite

918
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,440
dim

919
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:32,879
you know and if you move if you move the

920
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,880
meter up a little bit it might jump up

921
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,000
to like 400 so within an inch you're

922
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:41,039
getting huge variances right

923
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,038
that's why in in in ceilings and veg i

924
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:44,558
like to have the light very far away

925
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:46,158
because that means you move your meter

926
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:47,038
around where the plant goes around it's

927
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,000
not

928
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:52,640
wildly different and actually

929
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,960
a low reading further away is going to

930
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,200
be stronger than all that same reading

931
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,558
when it's close because

932
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,000
when it's close and you get a thousand

933
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,319
you move an inch down it's going to drop

934
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,159
down to maybe like 500 or something

935
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:05,918
you're far away and you get a thousand

936
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,039
that's really bright because you move an

937
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,278
inch down might go to 900. so it's

938
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:12,480
stronger light and it's more forgiving

939
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:14,798
so you don't

940
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,519
you don't get these wild wild variances

941
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:19,038
so that's my tip is

942
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,880
try to get those measurements the light

943
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,960
further away and then the plant will

944
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,320
understand it's a brighter light and you

945
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,640
can ramp it up to those higher

946
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:28,879
intensities much faster because if you

947
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,960
get in the if you start with your light

948
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,880
really close at like you know 200 pp of

949
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,159
d and you want to ramp that light up

950
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,240
those leaves are going to be pretty

951
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,159
wimpy and you need to grow a whole new

952
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,519
set and kind of train it to get to a

953
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,679
higher light source where if you have

954
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,599
something super bright far away

955
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,840
it's going to be used to kind of like a

956
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:47,759
sunlight brightness from that grow light

957
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:49,278
so that's kind of the answer that i give

958
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,359
i never really use a parameter when

959
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:53,440
growing it's all feel for me and

960
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,038
understanding and watching the plant you

961
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,919
know is are the leaves turning light

962
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:58,240
green

963
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,080
is it drooping you can see in the plant

964
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,960
if it has uh too much or too little

965
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,158
light

966
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,519
you definitely touched upon a little

967
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,399
while ago

968
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,440
a good reason why to have number one an

969
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:11,440
even canopy right and number two even

970
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,159
light spread with the grow light right

971
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,519
so

972
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,679
um having those two things as you

973
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:18,239
mentioned like it's it's so true the

974
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,358
fact that you your bud the top bud could

975
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,439
be at

976
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,440
800 ppfd right

977
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,440
but four or five inches lower than that

978
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,358
everything else getting you know 600 500

979
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,639
ppfd so it's like

980
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:30,480
there's a big difference there's two

981
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,159
reasons why i should aim for an even

982
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,320
light spread and have a grow light

983
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,398
that's gonna actually emit

984
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,200
even light across the entire footprint

985
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:39,838
so

986
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,480
yeah good call out there

987
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:43,759
so let's get into i mean touch upon ir i

988
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,519
don't know if there's anything else to

989
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,720
be said about ir and how it impacts

990
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:49,199
plant growth

991
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,118
or uv you know to maybe talk to us about

992
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,279
those two things how they you know how

993
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:57,119
they're beneficial for plant growth

994
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,800
yeah let's talk about ir first um so

995
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,320
uh here's something actually pretty

996
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,480
interesting so it does a lot of

997
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:07,200
different things so it's kind of like um

998
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:10,079
because we're it's like infrared is a

999
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:12,639
thing because it's normally not in in

1000
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,480
grow lights or leds these days uh which

1001
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:16,639
is not so it's like now we have to talk

1002
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,719
about how does the plant respond without

1003
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,400
infrared and how does it respond with

1004
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,480
infrared well

1005
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,119
uh going back to emerson effect it

1006
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,280
causes a little more growth

1007
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,599
uh photosynthesis photosynthetically

1008
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,280
when you when you introduce infrared

1009
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,200
it's just a fact

1010
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,880
so you get more growth

1011
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:37,199
not by like

1012
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,440
massive leaps and bounds on a

1013
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:42,159
photosynthetic

1014
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,320
level but

1015
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,799
you can get leaps and bounds with some

1016
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,320
other benefits especially in veg

1017
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,880
and

1018
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,200
the reason for that is it acts upon the

1019
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,320
plant in several different ways so

1020
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:58,960
first it will actually cause the leaves

1021
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,838
to get bigger so when the leaves get

1022
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,240
bigger

1023
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:03,679
then the plant is actually absorbing

1024
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:04,399
more light

1025
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:06,559
so

1026
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,320
when you give it infrared

1027
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:10,320
it less becomes the infrared doing

1028
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,480
anything the plant has just grown bigger

1029
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,640
leaves so therefore all the light that

1030
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,159
it gets is going to be greater

1031
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,358
so there's that too

1032
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:21,759
if you think about that aspect and then

1033
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,838
it also helps branching

1034
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,280
and that will cause

1035
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:28,719
more nodes to hit the canopy so um

1036
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,119
remember what i talked about before in

1037
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,118
the i think it was the capture part

1038
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,519
we're talking about different colors so

1039
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,920
infrared will go through

1040
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:39,759
the leaf along the green light so if you

1041
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,240
think about a plant down here all the i

1042
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,400
got the shadow on my hand there we go so

1043
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:45,679
this would be like more infrared and

1044
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,680
that that's where the phytochrome

1045
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:50,799
receptor that we all learned about comes

1046
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:52,799
into play this it's it's off off kilter

1047
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,839
and it's like whoa i need to reach for

1048
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,079
the light right so if you don't have

1049
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:59,440
infrared that response is just not as

1050
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,359
strong

1051
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,079
so you're getting a plant that's they're

1052
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:07,440
all gonna boom hit the canopy

1053
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,160
and you'll get more you'll get more

1054
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,599
sites that can get more light

1055
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:13,118
so you're you're getting more

1056
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,559
photosynthesis

1057
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,760
the leaves are getting bigger capturing

1058
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:18,400
more and you're getting more nodes

1059
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,280
hitting to where there is light

1060
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,519
so you get this kind of especially in

1061
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,560
veg you get this really nice boost in

1062
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:28,639
growth with infrared and it it can cause

1063
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:31,358
like like people will say

1064
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:33,440
infrared causes stretching you know like

1065
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:34,880
the sun has a huge amount of infrared

1066
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,400
and plants grow grey out there because

1067
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,480
it's a balanced spectrum

1068
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,200
or they'll say it's wasted which is not

1069
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:44,000
true anymore because we've proven that

1070
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:46,319
infrared does cause great uh growth and

1071
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,920
it's photosynthetically active so if you

1072
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,680
have infrared

1073
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,079
in your grow light it's going to give

1074
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:54,399
you uh those benefits not like night and

1075
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,160
day but it's they're there

1076
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,400
um and especially when you get into you

1077
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:59,759
know having the maximum amount of light

1078
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,519
you're going to want other colors to

1079
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,560
kind of fill that out because you're not

1080
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,880
maxing out on the other ones um so

1081
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,799
let's see here yeah so just to recap you

1082
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,559
get more growth

1083
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,880
uh leaf expansion

1084
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:15,519
better branching and overall bigger

1085
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,720
faster growing plant especially in veg

1086
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:20,480
then uv right was next yeah uv and

1087
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,078
there's some actually controversy behind

1088
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,559
this now i mean there's some people

1089
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,160
saying that uh there's studies in

1090
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:27,279
regards to it increases strike home

1091
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:29,519
production stuff like that but then

1092
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,880
there's stuff debunking that so what

1093
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,440
what's your take on uv what do you know

1094
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,838
about it yeah um

1095
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,159
so back in the day

1096
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:40,320
when people use uv

1097
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:43,199
um it was a stress to plant out

1098
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,240
to to get more trichromes which it does

1099
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:46,559
so

1100
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,919
and i think bruce dr vogby talks about

1101
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:51,279
this too it's

1102
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,358
stress causes that response so

1103
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,280
yes if you dose a plant with you know

1104
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:57,279
those old uv fluorescent bulbs it's

1105
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,960
going to cause it to stress out and may

1106
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,800
give you the result that you're looking

1107
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,519
for however you could probably get the

1108
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,200
same result by you know giving a drought

1109
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,838
giving it heat

1110
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:10,960
those sorts of things so it's like

1111
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:12,639
it that becomes less about the uv and

1112
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,800
more about the stress

1113
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:15,920
and and blue light also causes stress in

1114
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,440
the plane

1115
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,760
uh so that's why i think we're seeing

1116
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,000
that a little bit um what i know it's

1117
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,760
like going back to kind of like i think

1118
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,519
about a whole plate of food

1119
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,000
you know you work the best on a whole

1120
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:29,920
plate of food so if you have if you like

1121
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,280
don't eat your greens

1122
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,680
um

1123
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,280
that's you know you can survive but will

1124
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:37,519
you be like the very best if you don't

1125
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,000
eat your greens or veggies no

1126
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:42,719
that's kind of like uv so it's like a

1127
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,838
little piece on the plate of food that

1128
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,559
is there

1129
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:48,320
and will help the plant grow better

1130
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:49,920
uh slightly

1131
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,760
and i think that's what we're finding is

1132
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,440
you included this included it's not like

1133
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,839
nine day difference

1134
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,480
but it does

1135
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:59,679
help so uh what i've seen or heard i

1136
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,760
heard

1137
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,838
and this is um

1138
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,119
i figured it was talking to

1139
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:09,358
but in veg uh you can get

1140
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:12,318
uh basically like it's a gly glycogen

1141
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:14,480
store i think with uv so it stores it

1142
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:16,800
opens a pathway and veg so in flower

1143
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,039
it'll actually release it with uv i

1144
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,480
don't know if that's true or not but it

1145
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:24,960
has benefits in flower and veg that are

1146
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,039
that are slight and i think the key is a

1147
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,480
little bit goes a long way

1148
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:31,199
instead of just trying to stress out the

1149
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,400
plant with the uv

1150
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:35,838
so and then there's also like uvc uvb

1151
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,400
and uva

1152
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:39,838
uvc is like cancer causing i think

1153
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,838
they're using that

1154
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:44,318
to kill coronavirus like way back in the

1155
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:46,719
day super dangerous uvb

1156
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:49,519
um it's normally not so much in the sun

1157
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:52,318
so that's that's dangerous to uva is

1158
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:54,239
really what the what you're looking for

1159
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:56,800
giving to plants um and you can't get a

1160
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:59,439
sunburn from it so there's those the

1161
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,880
different ranges of uv

1162
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,039
okay gotcha

1163
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,318
now i know you can give too much uv you

1164
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:06,480
can actually do

1165
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:08,318
too much light a lot of people are

1166
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,960
getting light burn is often what it's

1167
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:13,119
called too but is there really such

1168
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,720
thing as light burn or is it just

1169
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,640
oftentimes it said it's just a lack of

1170
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:18,879
nutrients the the plant is working

1171
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:19,838
harder with the increased leg intensity

1172
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,358
and then there's just a lack of

1173
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:23,440
nutrients in the medium and that people

1174
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:24,639
should just increase the the nutrients

1175
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,358
in the medium

1176
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:26,960
so

1177
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,960
answer that is there such thing as too

1178
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,720
much light or what well if you think

1179
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,960
about the sun it's extraordinarily

1180
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:35,279
bright right and

1181
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,800
sometimes the sun will burn your plants

1182
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,560
outside just because they're not ready

1183
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,680
for it same thing with that with a grow

1184
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:43,440
light

1185
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:43,440
so the way i like to think about it is

1186
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:47,920
as i said before when you introduce your

1187
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:49,599
seedlings to that high light intensity

1188
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,200
at a far distance

1189
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,280
you're training it to get used to that

1190
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:55,919
really bright light right

1191
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,760
and if you don't do that

1192
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,880
and then you als all of a sudden get it

1193
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,640
like a close light range it's gonna fry

1194
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,119
and burn because those leaves are just

1195
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,639
not thick and ready for that high amount

1196
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,519
of light

1197
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:12,239
um like for example our electric sky

1198
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:13,759
b3 you know has what i consider like if

1199
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:14,959
you're running that thing max power i

1200
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,359
mean kudos

1201
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,920
that's off to you because it's 2000 ppfd

1202
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:22,318
here but if your plant which is outside

1203
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,800
sunlight intensity but if your plant is

1204
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:26,159
able to handle that which some growers

1205
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,800
you know like they've trained their

1206
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:30,399
plants very well they're very healthy

1207
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,280
they're not they're not gonna have a

1208
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,960
problem with it so

1209
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,640
but when you get to those levels you're

1210
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,800
just stressing the crap out of the plant

1211
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:41,199
so like think mistakes just happen

1212
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,560
faster so if you're cramming the plant

1213
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:44,719
with tons of light

1214
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,480
can you handle mistakes is it going to

1215
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:48,399
run out of water are your nutrients in

1216
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,240
check like is it the healthiest that can

1217
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,760
be because if it's not you're going to

1218
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,519
fall off a cliff and it's going to start

1219
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,880
to get damaged once you get a little bit

1220
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:58,239
of damage then

1221
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,240
boom so i would say unless you're you

1222
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:02,639
know

1223
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:04,559
you can get too much light depending on

1224
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:05,838
your environment and that's where co2

1225
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:07,519
comes in

1226
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:09,599
so the planet can actually handle more

1227
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:11,280
of it and you get a curve of where more

1228
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,480
light doesn't get you the same results

1229
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,519
anymore

1230
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,599
so

1231
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:17,440
and especially you know

1232
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,440
is there too much light for a new grower

1233
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,358
like absolutely like a thousand watt led

1234
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,679
grow light like actually a thousand

1235
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:25,838
watts and a 4x4 is going to roast

1236
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:27,519
probably like everything if you run it

1237
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:29,599
full power you know what i mean so it's

1238
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:31,358
like too much for that person and then

1239
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,880
can't are you actually going to get more

1240
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:34,719
yield with that

1241
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,720
you know or is it wasted you know that's

1242
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:37,598
kind of where i would go in my mind

1243
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:38,838
okay

1244
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,079
that makes

1245
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:43,920
sense let's talk about new science in

1246
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,280
regards to lighting so

1247
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,800
you know it seems like we're finding out

1248
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,280
things more and more new things are

1249
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,119
happening right within science um what

1250
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,119
new science in regards to lighting for

1251
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,400
plants has come out in the past year or

1252
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,760
so

1253
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,440
um yeah the dr bugbee with the infrared

1254
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,480
that's pretty big

1255
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,159
um with you know actually proving it

1256
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,559
fluence actually did a study about our

1257
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:08,639
favorite medicinal plant showing they

1258
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,799
gave it a baseline and like this is

1259
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:13,118
actually like yield in in the medicinal

1260
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,560
plant they did a baseline

1261
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,559
of light

1262
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:18,480
and added added like this much white

1263
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,239
light or this much

1264
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,800
infrared and the infrared you can see

1265
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:24,239
like a sizeable gain

1266
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,920
over white light which is actually

1267
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:27,598
pretty cool so not only does it

1268
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,358
photosynthetically active but they show

1269
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,838
there is a slight gain

1270
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:34,000
and they just did that in flower

1271
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:35,279
so you're you're not that did not

1272
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,039
recognize

1273
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,519
any of the

1274
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:41,519
benefits that you might get in veg like

1275
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:42,960
like because usually with infrared you

1276
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:45,199
get a bigger plant

1277
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,720
so it didn't it didn't study that like

1278
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:47,519
it was just flower

1279
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:51,519
so

1280
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:53,358
they showed that which is exciting um

1281
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:55,039
i think now i think

1282
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:56,559
it's harder to find breakthroughs

1283
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:57,440
because if you think about it many years

1284
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:59,039
ago

1285
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,440
we didn't think green light caused

1286
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:03,358
growth you know we didn't think infrared

1287
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,440
costs grow and now we're there

1288
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:06,960
um so now it's kind of like okay you're

1289
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,400
you're getting into the nitty-gritty of

1290
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,720
like uv

1291
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,280
and you're gonna get lots of uh hype you

1292
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,959
know conflicting plant science articles

1293
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,760
uh like what i found is sometimes you

1294
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,440
can run the same experiment twice

1295
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,200
and you get different results because

1296
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,519
something else is off so i think we're

1297
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:24,960
just going to find the fine tune of

1298
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:26,559
you know what where

1299
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,400
and you know there's so many things you

1300
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:29,759
can study so

1301
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,079
really kind of we're getting to the end

1302
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,760
of understanding a lot of what light

1303
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,119
does i was going to say what do you see

1304
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,599
happening with planet lighting over the

1305
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:40,160
next three to five years

1306
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,680
well um

1307
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:43,118
i don't think

1308
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:44,838
efficiency is gonna be that i think

1309
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,960
we're there in terms of

1310
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:48,318
efficiency um

1311
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,880
and you know

1312
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:52,880
your plant doesn't understand efficiency

1313
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,480
right so i think you know

1314
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,039
a lot of people are caught up in like a

1315
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,400
number that's advertised and

1316
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:59,358
the home grower

1317
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,200
like

1318
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:02,799
you know i don't even know how money

1319
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:05,439
walks my refrigerator pulls from the

1320
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,039
wall so it's like

1321
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,880
there's that you know it's like is your

1322
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:10,960
refrigerator more efficient than your

1323
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,800
grow light like who knows using this

1324
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,720
you know so

1325
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,800
that i think is because they become less

1326
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:18,318
important um i'm not actually sure

1327
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,880
because it seems like

1328
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:22,559
you know this is you know more wattage

1329
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,599
more efficiency

1330
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:25,039
um

1331
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,318
you know i think we're going to see just

1332
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:27,440
different brands through different

1333
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:29,039
things

1334
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,039
uh with what they're lighting and maybe

1335
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:32,559
a consolidation there but

1336
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:33,759
um kind of seems like everyone's doing

1337
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:35,279
the same thing

1338
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,240
so we'll see how long that can last i'm

1339
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,160
not sure

1340
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:40,000
yeah people are so uh nitpicky when it

1341
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:43,199
comes to the efficiency i mean it was

1342
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,318
like you know 2.8 2.9 micromost per

1343
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,199
joule and then a light will come out

1344
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:49,920
where it's like 3.0 and it's like you're

1345
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:52,239
comparing prices like 2.8 microns per

1346
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,240
joule 3.0 it's like do i want to pay the

1347
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:56,479
extra 2 300

1348
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,799
for that 3.0 might you know what i mean

1349
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,240
it's like it's crazy how like

1350
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,000
people are so nitpicky and they want the

1351
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:05,439
best of the best as far as efficiency

1352
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,440
yeah point one at

1353
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:10,400
that's like

1354
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:11,759
three percent difference you know a lot

1355
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,800
okay yeah like yeah like what's the

1356
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,280
difference

1357
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,359
could you do yeah three

1358
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,280
3.0 difference between 2.8 yeah that's

1359
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:21,440
like not that's not very much you know

1360
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,680
like nothing like five and seven

1361
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,159
seven percent so yeah and then at that

1362
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:27,598
point it's like output and like even you

1363
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,318
know it's a different output ranges so

1364
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,519
if you get like 10 more watts here

1365
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:33,358
yeah it's

1366
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:35,358
it's uh

1367
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:37,039
even measuring the light is so confusing

1368
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:38,400
too i mean you can put into a sphere you

1369
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:40,719
can do a map

1370
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,720
but all those you know it's it's really

1371
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:45,358
at the end of the day yield

1372
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:47,279
and actually what's fascinating is and

1373
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:49,759
here's another tidbit is

1374
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,160
it's like a red and blue light is like

1375
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,520
the most efficient girl like you can get

1376
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:57,358
like i think up to four you mole right

1377
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:59,199
so

1378
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:00,799
and like if you if you look at a

1379
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:02,639
spectral chart you see it has a lot of

1380
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,039
blue

1381
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:08,480
the blue is really efficient too

1382
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:11,759
so and and uh even uh dr bugbee even

1383
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:15,119
said in a previous video that red is 30

1384
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,800
30 more efficient at creating growth

1385
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,760
so if you're looking at a uml and you're

1386
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,839
like

1387
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,000
man this one's a higher humor but it has

1388
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:24,000
more blue than this one

1389
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,318
well what's the plant gonna think

1390
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,920
right it's it's not

1391
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:29,599
reality it's

1392
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,880
you you can get a better reading on

1393
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,200
paper

1394
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,960
and then and then plant growth is just

1395
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:37,598
not something you can

1396
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,519
you can like you know say or or like

1397
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,039
give it a number so that's something to

1398
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:43,119
think about too so look for that blue

1399
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:44,480
spike the higher the blue spike higher

1400
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,400
the red spike

1401
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,159
your concentrating energy in those two

1402
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,599
two areas and it's gonna be more

1403
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:52,960
efficient but that might not always

1404
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:54,720
translate to uh micro that makes sense

1405
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,079
so we're gonna see any new or updated

1406
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:58,799
grow lights from the green sunshine

1407
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,000
company in 2022 or what

1408
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,800
maybe

1409
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,119
we're working on a few things uh nothing

1410
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:08,000
to directly replace we have going on now

1411
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,838
with the 300 and 180s but perhaps around

1412
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,838
when this video is released

1413
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:13,599
something will be around the corner

1414
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:15,599
i hope so we're trying to we're trying

1415
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,960
to do something a little different than

1416
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,838
everybody else as always but uh yeah

1417
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,599
cool

1418
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:23,599
so kind of wrapping things up how can

1419
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,960
listeners find you and uh is there

1420
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,280
anything you got upcoming in the future

1421
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,119
that you want to talk about or um let's

1424
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:36,159
we just have our new

1425
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,838
we did a revamp of our grow kits so

1426
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:40,078
that's exciting so we've got grow kids

1427
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:41,679
with earth dust i've even talked about

1428
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,079
nutrients and all the earth dust is our

1429
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:45,358
amendments that you add the soil it's

1430
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,800
got everything you need it's got all the

1431
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:48,318
microbes in there so it makes it super

1432
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,160
easy to grow we're just going to

1433
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:52,719
continue doing that and then you can

1434

00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,119
goal of 200. dan this has been awesome

1467
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:58,719
man this is uh

1468
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,880
there's so much to know about lighting

1469
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:02,558
for sure and you uh you definitely

1470
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,800
touched upon some things that haven't

1471
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,640
been touched upon on this channel or i

1472
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,559
guess on your channel too you said so

1473
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:11,279
good to have you here and release some

1474
