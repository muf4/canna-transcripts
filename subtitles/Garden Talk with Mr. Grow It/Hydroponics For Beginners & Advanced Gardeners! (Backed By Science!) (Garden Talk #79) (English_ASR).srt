1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,160
coming up on garden talk it is

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,919
definitely not the optimal way to grow

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,400
it's just a way to grow that is

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,320
extremely simple so if you are in a

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,480
place where you have no energy access

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,798
where you can have a pump you can still

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,278
grow things hydroponically using the

8
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:19,278
kratky method it can be as complicated

9
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,600
or as simple as you want the simplest

10
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,359
versions of this are extremely simple i

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,278
can guarantee most people have the stuff

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,599
they need from a growing perspective in

13
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,759
their house if you use something like a

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,159
normal miracle grow that is a high urea

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,160
fertilizer in hydroponics the plants

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,319
will die when the plant gets the

17
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,159
solution it will uptake some things and

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,759
release some things and those things

19
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,078
that the plant uptakes and release

20
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,960
heavily affect the ph even though it

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,799
seems very intimidating it can't be

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:52,239
done and you will be saving yourself

23
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,238
like a lot of money

24
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,640
what's up everybody if you that don't

25
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,920

00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,640
channel in this episode he talks all

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,560
about hydroponics there's definitely

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,400
some good information for beginners such

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,240
as the basics but there's also a lot of

35

54
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:01,039
growing process by automating stage of

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,680
growth requirements on and off schedules

56
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,680
spectral range airflow and circulation

57
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,000
and even records useful data about your

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,920

66
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,239
oscillating fan is now released i've

67
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,480
been using their six-inch version for

68
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,400
over six months now and i absolutely

69
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,639
love it it's easy to clip on the side of

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,480
my grow tent and it has 10 different

71
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,799
speeds which makes it easy to control

72
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,399
air circulation they do also have

73
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,560
non-oscillating versions of these

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
clip-on fans these fans are currently in

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,039
high demand when they sell out of the

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,120
fans which i expect them to often you

77
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,679
can pre-order them for the next release

talk podcast today i am joined with

86
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,919
daniel fernandez from science on

87
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,238
hydroponics how you doing today i'm

88
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,799
doing great thanks for having me first

89
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,878
of all we enjoy your podcast so this is

90
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,560
a great opportunity for me to be able to

91
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:21,840
have this talk with you

92
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,360
yeah i appreciate you coming on when you

93
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,959
reached out to me through dms like i

94
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,080
mentioned before we hit the record

95
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,959
button here i noticed you from the

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,280
cultivation certificate program at utah

97
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,959
state university with dr bruce bugbee

98
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,799
and i actually attended that and i saw

99
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,120
you you have a couple videos through

100
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,400
that program and i recognize your name

101
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,640
right away through instagram and i was

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,000
like yes he wants to come on so i know

103
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,598
you have extensive knowledge when it

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,439
comes to hydroponics i mean you have a

105
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,798
whole youtube channel based around it

106
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,400
and that's what really what we're going

107
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,080
to get into today talk all about

108
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
hydroponics we're going to get into some

109
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,439
stuff for beginners but we're also

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,959
getting into some more advanced

111
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:58,479
knowledge stuff for those folks that

112
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,158
have the experience that want to get to

113
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,479
the next level so i think this is going

114
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,158
to appeal to a wide audience

115
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,399
but first what i like to do with all the

116
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,919
guests is an introduction can you tell

117
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,599
us a little bit about yourself and how

118
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,079
you got into gardening

119
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:15,280
uh yeah sure so as you mentioned my name

120
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,519
is daniel fernandez i

121
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,160
got into gardening around 20 years ago

122
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,079
when i was 15. you know i had a big

123
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,199
space that

124
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,079
i could grow things in and then a friend

125
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,000
told me that we should try hydroponics

126
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,319
so we actually started growing tomatoes

127
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,160
there and at the time

128
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,478
that was right before i started studying

129
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,919
chemistry so i did my undergrad in

130
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:44,159
chemistry while i learned hydroponics

131
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:44,959
and then i went and did a phd in spain

132
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,040
and

133
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:50,560
and i've been working in hydroponics

134
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,639
ever since so i've been working

135
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,639
in my own growth

136
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,720
20 years and then

137
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,639
i've been working with people as a

138
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,720
consultant for the past more or less 12

139
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,720
years awesome

140
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,199
so let's start with a basic question

141
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,680
super basic for the beginners

142
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,800
what is hydroponics and what are some of

143
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,280
the hydroponic systems out there so

144
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,199
that is an interesting question and it's

145
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,198
it's not as straightforward like there

146
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,439
are a lot of definitions out there i

147
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:23,120
like to think about hydroponics as any

148
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:25,038
crop where you have no soil in it

149
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,000
so for me anytime where you're growing

150
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,918
plants and there is no soil that

151
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,478
contains the nutrition that the plants

152
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,159
need then that to me is a hydroponic

153
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,399
crop in

154
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,039
the scientific community it will be more

155
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:41,359
formally defined as a crop where you

156
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,279
have only water so where you have no

157
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,759
media to support plants

158
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,359
while the growth where you have media

159
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,520
supporting the plants for example when

160
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,759
you grow in cocoa or in rock wool those

161
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,240
are more referred to as soilless culture

162
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,759
i like to think about all of those as

163
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,400
hydroponics

164
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,319
and i mean that's to me it's the science

165
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,399
of growing plants without soil like

166
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,400
hydroponic culture

167
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,359
regarding the types of systems that you

168
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,799
have

169
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,319
so

170
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,520
depending on the type of plant that you

171
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,240
have you have access to different

172
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,159
systems the most basic systems that we

173
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,478
have are basically a plant with its

174
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,520
roots sitting in water where you have

175
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,199
all

176
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,478
the things that we what we call deep

177
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,919
water culture

178
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:26,159
and what we call kratky systems and you

179
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,758
then have see this usually caters to

180
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,680
plants that are smaller

181
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,800
and normally

182
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,879
you have then systems for bigger plants

183
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,400
that you can have things like dutch

184
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,279
buckets where you have large amounts of

185
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,439
media there or you can even have bigger

186
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,679
plants in what we call like they there

187
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,639
are industrial systems to do this type

188
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,120
of thing

189
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,960
where we have channels you know if

190
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,800
somebody has ever seen

191
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,959
a hydroponic crop where you have these

192
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,360
huge gutters that are normally made of

193
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:58,719
plastic and then you have plants grown

194
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,639
on them and these plants these systems

195
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,960
are usually what we call nutrient flow

196
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,840
technique systems nft systems and we

197
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:08,239
also have dft systems and

198
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:10,239
which are deep

199
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,720
flow technique systems

200
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,160
so all of these systems can be used to

201
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,919
to grow plants

202
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,759
you mentioned the kratky method and

203
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,560
that's a method that has been around for

204
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,720
a very long time a lot of people use it

205
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,478
we haven't yet talked about it on this

206
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,880
podcast can you explain what is the

207
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:29,360
kratky method and how does that work

208
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:32,959
so the kratky method is

209
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,840
was created by dr kratkin hawaii

210
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,359
so

211
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,000
around the

212
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,240
20 years ago more or less are the first

213
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,598
papers about it and then you have papers

214
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,360
up until like

215
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,680
the mid-2010s

216
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,919
i believe and the idea here is basically

217
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,519
to grow a plant with no energy input

218
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,240
what happens is that when you have

219
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,959
something like a plant that is sitting

220
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,840
on water that the roots are in the water

221
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:02,399
the water needs to contain oxygen for

222
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,959
the roots to uptake nutrients if the

223
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,439
water runs out of oxygen then the roots

224
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:11,519
will die normally

225
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:13,918
so what happens in um kratky system

226
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,478
is that we want to be able to grow

227
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,399
without having to introduce that oxygen

228
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,079
because in a normal deep water culture

229
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,560
system you'll need to constantly pump

230
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,038
air to keep that oxygen high enough well

231
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,120
in the cracking method we say we don't

232
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,800
even need that what we're going to do is

233
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,399
that simply we're going to add all the

234
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,919
water that the plant needs for its

235
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,598
entire life

236
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,598
and then we're going to let the roots

237
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,240
drain that water so the plant will

238
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,479
transpire that water and by reducing the

239
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,680
level of the water the roots that get

240
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,720
exposed to the air will actually be able

241
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,079
to absorb oxygen and use that oxygen

242
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,240
transported to the roots that are

243
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,080
actually submerged in the water to get

244
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,839
nutrients so in this way you can grow

245
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,680
basically any plant

246
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,600
provided you can put all the water

247
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,519
that's ever gonna be needed

248
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,320
in the initial reservoir

249
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,879
so this sort of method is

250
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,959
sort of limited to plants that are small

251
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,240
because you can imagine that a tomato

252
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,919
plant might use

253
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,080
i don't know 100 gallons of water

254
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,958
through its lifetime so it might be

255
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,278
difficult for you to create a tall 100

256
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:22,399
gallon container and then have it empty

257
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:24,799
while a lettuce plant might use

258
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,879
a tenth of that or even less so it might

259
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:30,000
use very little water which allows you

260
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:32,159
to basically put the plant inside of a

261
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,080
the plant in a bucket

262
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,480
where the roots are growing into the

263
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,839
water and then they transpire the water

264
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,000
the water level is dropping it's

265
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,800
dropping is dropping it allows oxygen to

266
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,839
be transported and the plant does not

267
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,399
die

268
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,080
and it is a low yielding method yields

269
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,080
in kratky are obviously lower because

270
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,879
the plant is under like a optimal

271
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,800
condition the entire time trying to stay

272
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,879
alive but you can grow healthy plants

273
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,120
you can grow leafy greens you can't even

274
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,200
grow tomatoes if you like are willing to

275
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,278
replenish solution and introduce a

276
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,680
little bit of labor into it

277
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,759
but it is definitely not the optimal way

278
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,239
to grow it's just a way to grow that is

279
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,159
extremely simple so if you are in a

280
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,320
place where you have no energy access

281
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,639
where you can have a pump you can still

282
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,040
grow things hydroponically using the

283
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,159
kratky method that's interesting yeah

284
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,559
i've heard a lot of people having

285
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,240
success with that method and like they

286
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,479
said the same thing you did is it's a

287
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,639
simple method but i personally haven't

288
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,079
tried that method yet so yeah really

289
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:31,679
interesting to hear i know there's a lot

290
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,039
of people out there that you know they

291
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,719
hear about hydroponics talking about a

292
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,000
whole system that needs to be purchased

293
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,519
some people are spending hundreds of

294
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,200
dollars on systems

295
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,278
but really you don't have to spend that

296
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,278
much you can do a diy you can actually

297
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,799
build it yourself some people have the

298
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:46,799
materials just lying around their house

299
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,120
or in their garage for example

300
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:52,639
can you talk to us about how to create a

301
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,399
basic diy hydroponic system okay so it

302
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,879
depends fundamentally on the level of

303
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,958
complexity all you need in reality is a

304
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,480
container that you can put a plant in

305
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,958
with water in it

306
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,200
so think about akratki setup in a kratky

307
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,518
setup you can use a mason jar to build

308
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,278
that kratky setup or you can use any

309
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,278
sort of container where you can place

310
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,759
the plant and then have the water inside

311
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:17,039
the container there is no need for any

312
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:20,240
sort of a high tech stuff just a

313
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,759
container is enough for starting

314
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,600
of course

315
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,679
what do you want to achieve with your

316
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,399
growing system do you just want to grow

317
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,639
a plant and see it grow and you don't

318
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,519
care too much about learning about

319
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,559
what's going on and your priorities are

320
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,720
to have

321
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,039
less to to

322
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,519
spend less time growing the plan if

323
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,519
that's your priority then akratki system

324
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,000
is going to be a great introduction and

325
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,078
something that you can do basically set

326
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,320
and forget type of thing

327
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,078
however if you're interesting if you're

328
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,959
interested in growing

329
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,679
and

330
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:58,000
learning more about hydroponics then a

331
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,239
deep water culture system is

332
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,480
close to the exact same thing just with

333
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,039
an air pump in just with an air stone

334
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,600
and an air pump and the issue is that

335
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:10,399
because uh the water culture system is

336
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,800
way more efficient the plant will gather

337
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,320
way more nutrition from it and therefore

338
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,639
the chemistry will be affected

339
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,879
significantly more so you will need to

340
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,959
do things like ph monitoring ec

341
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,879
monitoring adjust the level of the

342
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,799
solution all these sorts of things that

343
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:27,200
a kratky setup doesn't have to deal with

344
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,439
because it's less efficient a less

345
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,519
efficient growing method anybody can do

346
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,519
a deep water culture system with like

347
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,440
minimal investment for like a couple of

348
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,120
plants or something like that

349
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,600
you can also go more into it and then

350
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,440
there are a bunch of alternatives that

351
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,560
are midway between buying something

352
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,399
fully made

353
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,479
and

354
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,958
building it yourself from like complete

355
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,039
scratch for example to build an nft

356
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,439
system maybe you

357
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,958
don't want to like cut the plastic

358
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,519
gutters yourself

359
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,679
you can just buy the the

360
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,839
gutters already pre-made and then do the

361
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,759
rest yourself it can be as complicated

362
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,160
or as simple as you want the simplest

363
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,838
versions of this are extremely simple i

364
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,759
can guarantee most people have the stuff

365
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,079
they need from a growing perspective in

366
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,319
their house not counting the fertilizer

367
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:19,039
but just the containers and stuff

368
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,440
and and then you can make it as

369
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:24,000
more advanced as as you want

370
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,160
and you know you could even go even some

371
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,958
diy people have gone into like fully

372
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:31,199
automated hydroponic systems where you

373
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,359
have peristaltic pumps doing all the

374
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,120
nutrient dosing and the ph adjusting and

375
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,240
you have environmental control and i

376
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,159
mean diy in hydroponics goes as simple

377
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,720
or as crazy as you want it to go

378
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,719
depending on your level of interest

379
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,480
the amount of time that you have and

380
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,320
well what your goals are

381
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,639
yeah everybody who actually he just

382
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,720
grows one plant and he took a five

383
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,720
gallon bucket with a lid

384
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,920
cut a hole in the top dropped a net pot

385
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,000
in there uh had his air stones fed into

386
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:01,360
there and that's pretty much it of

387
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,278
course you have the hydroton pellets in

388
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,278
the net pot and stuff like that but like

389
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,360
that's all he does you know he monitors

390
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,919
water level there's some maintenance but

391
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,480
very very basic something you can do on

392
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,679
your own with very minimal money so i

393
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,600
want to make that well known to the

394
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:18,719
folks that are beginners that maybe feel

395
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,040
overwhelmed listening to this

396
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,040
because it can be that simple

397
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:25,360
there are there are several videos on my

398
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,278
channel about a system that i built

399
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,120
using uh

400
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,198
what was it like a four gallon bucket a

401
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,278
five gallon bucket with a net pot and a

402
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,599
lid and it was a kratky system it didn't

403
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:38,720
have a pot it didn't have i i did

404
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,480
monitor the ph and the easy 24 7 because

405
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,040
part of the objective was to log it but

406
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,680
i could have not done that so

407
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,879
it is definitely can be extremely simple

408
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,519
absolutely

409
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:52,320
let's get into the fertilizer side of

410
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,879
things here so what fertilizers can be

411
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,760
used and then what fertilizers can't be

412
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,439
used in hydroponics so that's a very

413
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,838
interesting question and a question that

414
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,160
comes up very frequently they're the

415
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,839
fertilizers that most people are used to

416
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,838
are the fertilizers that are used for

417
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,360
soil

418
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,839
soil

419
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,600
has a big advantage to it and it's that

420
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,480
it has a lot of microbes that can

421
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,800
process things into other things

422
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,199
and most importantly

423
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,439
you have urea

424
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:25,599
that is a very very common

425
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,279
commodity fertilizer because it's

426
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,240
practically the cheapest form of

427
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,838
nitrogen you can get of reduced nitrogen

428
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,680
and then

429
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,600
you can use that in soil because there

430
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,838
are bacteria there that can convert that

431
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,560
urea into nitrate which is a form of

432
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,279
nitrogen that plants do best with

433
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:47,119
now in hydroponics there are usually no

434
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:48,958
such bacterial bacterial populations so

435
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,799
if you use something like a normal

436
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,198
miracle grow that is a high urea

437
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:56,000
fertilizer in hydroponics the plants

438
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:59,120
will die because they will not get any

439
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,039
nitrate from it the ph will acidify

440
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,720
extremely fast whenever that urea is

441
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,719
decomposed to ammonium so

442
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,879
basically if you're thinking about soil

443
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,959
fertilizers especially the nitrogen

444
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,679
containing soil fertilizers all those

445
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,439
cannot be used in hydroponics

446
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:18,000
there are also a lot of things that are

447
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,920
insoluble that are used in soil we have

448
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,958
a lot of fertilizers like rock

449
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:26,559
phosphates like maybe

450
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,439
we have composts we have things that

451
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,518
are

452
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,000
good for soil because the microbes can

453
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,320
break it down but in a hydroponic setup

454
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,879
they would just sit there and there

455
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,519
would they wouldn't dissolve at all

456
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:41,679
so we definitely don't want to be using

457
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,519
anything that is insoluble or that is

458
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,039
the wrong chemical form

459
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,600
there are a bunch of things that are

460
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,838
shared between both worlds for example

461
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,399
calcium nitrate which is a super common

462
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,720
fertilizer used to green out

463
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,278
yards like front yards

464
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,199
uh green up incredibly easily when you

465
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,360
apply calcium nitrate to it so that's a

466
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:03,838
fertilizer that is sort of used in those

467
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,360
situations as well and then it is also

468
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,959
very commonly used in fertilizers

469
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,438
because in the end everything you use in

470
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,839
hydroponics you could use in soil but

471
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,400
not the other way around so anything

472
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:17,279
that is hydroponic that is a hydroponic

473
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,600
fertilizer is going to be

474
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,318
usable in a soil environment but the

475
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,078
other way around is not the case so if

476
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,720
you want to buy a fertilizer for

477
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:29,359
hydroponics then you need to ensure that

478
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,279
it is formulated for hydroponic growing

479
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:33,599
if you are not familiar with the

480
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,200
chemistry of how all this happens

481
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,000
got it and i know you're actually a

482
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,440
proponent of making your own nutrients

483
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,119
can you talk to us about how to make

484
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,440
your own nutrients for hydroponic

485
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,839
systems yeah so when i talk about making

486
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,600
your own nutrients i refer to using so

487
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,720
most of the fertilizers that you can buy

488
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,439
that are

489
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,360
for hydroponics are blends of

490
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,519
raw fertilizer inputs

491
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,918
so what i mean when i say make your own

492
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,960
fertilizer is instead of buying these

493
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,440
boutique blends for hydroponics you can

494
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,440
actually make your own from these raw

495
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,759
fertilizer inputs

496
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,120
so i created a program that's called

497
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:15,279
hydrobody that i created 13 years ago in

498
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:17,678
2009 that basically helps you formulate

499
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:21,279
your own fertilizers using these raw

500
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,640
inputs so chemistry can be extremely

501
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:24,480
um

502
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,360
extremely intimidating to a lot of

503
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,360
people

504
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,279
and so i understand that this is not

505
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,599
very easy to do

506
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:34,000
but there are like some baby steps that

507
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,759
can be involved here for example instead

508
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,440
of having to make a complete fertilizer

509
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,679
with all the elements that are required

510
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,558
for a plant to survive from scratch from

511
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:46,320
all the different raw fertilizer inputs

512
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:49,359
you can actually start by

513
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,240
going into for example a fertilizer like

514
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,000
uh

515
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,000
5 11 26

516
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,759
for example like a master blend or a

517
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,279
peters5 26 which has already most of the

518
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:02,079
things blended in ratios that are

519
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,960
adequate and then you just make

520
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:07,119
the calcium nitrate and the

521
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,279
let's say modern potassium phosphate or

522
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:12,479
some of these other fertilizers so sort

523
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:14,399
of a midpoint between these two things

524
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,000
and then from there

525
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,240
you know you can move into making your

526
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,359
own concentrated solutions so that you

527
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,599
can then

528
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,599
prepare your own fertilizers

529
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,439
and i at your

530
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,199
at your house or at your grow or

531
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,679
anything like this

532
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,919
um or you can also

533
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,080
move instead of making your nutrient

534
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,919
solution you can also move perhaps it's

535
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,639
less intimidating to then start making

536
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,320
your own amendments so there are things

537
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,759
for example like

538
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,639
calmax

539
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:47,759
that you can make yourself call max or

540
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,400
fertilizers that use calcium magnesium

541
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:53,119
salts that i have a videos i have a

542
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,480
video about making a calmac and you use

543
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,558
um calcium nitrate calcium acetate salts

544
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,240
of this sort you blend them and you

545
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,879
create you create a solution with them

546
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,798
and then that's your calmac and i know

547
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,280
i'm talking about all it's very hard to

548
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:09,839
talk about uh such a complicated topic

549
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,759
in such a short amount of time but if

550
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,599
you go to my website or if you look at

551
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,519
my youtube channel i have a lot of

552
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:18,000
videos about how to actually make your

553
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:20,158
own fertilizers where i talk about the

554
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,480
chemistry of how to do this properly

555
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,400
what inputs to use which sorts of

556
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,640
formulations to make

557
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,960
it's an entire world but what i want

558
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,520
people to take from this is that even

559
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,720
though it seems very intimidating

560
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,558
it can't be

561
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,960
done and you will be saving yourself

562
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:41,440
like a lot of money because the markup

563
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,159
in these hydroponic fertilizers the

564
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,120
markups are insane like the margins that

565
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,280
fertilizer manufacturers make are

566
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,599
very very large and especially the ones

567
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,240
that are selling you fertilizers that

568
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:57,279
are specialized for certain plants those

569
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,839
will be usually the most most expensive

570
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:02,480
because like definitely peters or master

571
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,839
blender aren't making like a lot of

572
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,120
margin on their

573
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:09,119
5 11 26 or these sorts of blends that

574
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,359
they make that are for like the large

575
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,119
scale horticultural industry i was gonna

576
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:15,119
say there must be a significant cost

577
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,798
savings and you answered that yeah there

578
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,038
is and if you spend the time to do the

579
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,879
research to learn how to do it you know

580
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,038
going to your website or youtube channel

581
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,280
or whatever and and learning how to

582
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:28,079
formulate your own nutrients in the long

583
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:30,000
run it'll definitely save you so yeah

584
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:32,158
thanks for sharing that with us today

585
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,319
the cost savings just to go a little bit

586
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,120
different though the cost savings are

587
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,399
normally for a single person making this

588
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:41,038
and

589
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,519
they can be it can be even 100 times

590
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,839
cheaper if you're willing to buy

591
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,519
a large enough quantity of things that's

592
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,918
incredible

593
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,158
so i have to ask about organic growing

594
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,400
in hydroponics some people say it's not

595
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,240
possible there's some people that say it

596
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,159
is possible

597
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,319
talk to us about organic growing and

598
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,039
hydroponics is it actually possible or

599
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:05,439
not it depends on how you define it

600
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:08,079
so if we define hydro if we define

601
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,320
organic growing as

602
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:12,960
the agricultural practice

603
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,558
that grows the soil then it is

604
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,798
impossible because by definition

605
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:17,519
hydroponics does not include any solid

606
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:19,119
so

607
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,720
if we start with that definition then

608
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:23,759
the answer is that it can't be done

609
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,960
however if we go for a more um holistic

610
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:30,079
definition where we do not say soil must

611
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,038
be involved but let's say no

612
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,399
um

613
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:35,519
processed fertilizers can be used no

614
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,320
um

615
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,200
like

616
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:41,279
synthetic fertilizers can be used so we

617
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,759
go into a world where can we grow in a

618
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,480
hydroponic setup using only the raw

619
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:49,599
inputs that would be allowed in a soil

620
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,200
hydroponic crop in a sorry in a soil

621
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:54,000
a organic crop

622
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,880
so could we do that uh the answer is

623
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,359
that we can we can do it like i've

624
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,280
worked i've been working with several

625
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,279
large-scale facilities growing leafy

626
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,599
greens organically

627
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,599
and we have achieved it and you can look

628
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,480
at that in my instagram and you can see

629
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:14,480
pictures where we we're growing

630
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:17,360
plants in fully organic solutions in

631
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,599
a hydroponic environment where we are

632
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,678
even beating the yields of the

633
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,199
conventional hydroponic setups that are

634
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,120
right next to them

635
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,558
so it can be done

636
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:29,199
and

637
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:32,558
it can be done very successfully now it

638
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,000
is tricky because a lot of the as i

639
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,399
mentioned there are things like the

640
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,240
nitrogen cycle that does not exist in a

641
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,000
hydroponic setup so we need to

642
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,319
separate things a little bit and what we

643
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,278
do need to do is a lot of pre-processing

644
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:49,599
of the solutions right so while you

645
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:52,798
would mix for example

646
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:55,359
i don't know your your

647
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,558
for example corn steeply core is a very

648
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,278
common

649
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:58,960
uh

650
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:00,880
source of phosphorus in organic growing

651
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,880
because it's very high phosphorus it

652
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,679
contains a lot of lactic acid for

653
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,520
example if you use stealing hydroponics

654
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,440
as is it wouldn't work well because that

655
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:12,079
amount of lactic acid would be toxic to

656
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,798
the plants so we need to

657
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:18,319
pre-ferment that in a tank with adequate

658
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:21,519
bacteria to get all those organic acids

659
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:24,000
to be used and turned into co2 and

660
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,038
we eliminate it and that way we can

661
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,240
create

662
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:30,720
a fertilizers that can be used in in a

663
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,558
hydroponic setup now at a large scale we

664
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,360
do this at the large-scale facilities

665
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:37,918
right but there are already companies

666
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:41,038
that are producing these like fertilizer

667
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,320
pre-fermented inputs that you can use

668
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,720
and

669
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,079
there is a company that is i'm not

670
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,159
affiliated with which is called

671
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,720
agriculture which has like potassium

672
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,720
nitrate equivalent solutions calcium

673
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,519
nitrate equivalent solutions that are

674
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,400
all omri registered and that are derived

675
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:00,400
fully from organic inputs and they are

676
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,519
just processed so that all these

677
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,600
available forms of nutrition are

678
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:08,240
already there so that they don't need to

679
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,798
be generated right there so

680
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,880
yeah if we define organics as growing

681
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:17,278
plants using only omri approved inputs

682
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,679
then we can we can do it and we can do

683
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:22,159
it with like we need actually active

684
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,720
bacterial populations to be able to

685
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,640
achieve these with without a problem now

686
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,558
what about microbial inoculants see i

687
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,799
mean touched upon microbes earlier in

688
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,879
this episode and uh you mentioned that

689
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:36,240
there's really no exchange happening as

690
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,679
far as the conversion of elements in

691
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,839
hydroponics

692
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:43,038
are microbial inoculants

693
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:45,199
useless when growing hydroponically or

694
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,319
are they useful in some ways

695
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,120
they are

696
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:51,119
so yeah this is super controversial

697
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,038
because the evidence is all over the

698
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:54,879
place if you look at the scientific

699
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,839
evidence of micro inoculation in

700
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,039
hydroponics you'll find anything

701
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,359
so

702
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,440
i think that the answer is

703
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:06,079
if you're perfect

704
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,600
the benefits from them are going to be

705
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:09,918
very limited

706
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:12,719
because if your growing conditions are

707
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:15,520
absolutely perfect the microbes are very

708
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,278
little to contribute because everything

709
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,639
is already perfect if you are not

710
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:22,960
perfect then they might give you some

711
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,759
breathing room if you screw up

712
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,360
so they can help you if your growing

713
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:29,359
conditions are not perfect if there's

714
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,759
stress going on there might be

715
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:34,000
mechanisms by which they can protect you

716
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,519
not all hydroponic systems are suitable

717
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,359
for microbes if you have a deep water

718
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:38,400
culture system and you add microbes to

719
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,599
it it will be

720
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,038
super

721
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:45,359
dirty and if the solution does not cater

722
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,359
to those microbes then those microbes

723
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,678
will likely become

724
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:52,639
or they will encourage pathogenic

725
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,759
microbes than getting in there so you

726
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,600
need to if you are going to have

727
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,558
microbes then the solution needs to

728
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:00,719
cater to them as well and the media also

729
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:02,480
needs to cater to them so it is a

730
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,159
decision that needs to be made like is

731
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,159
it going to have microbes or is it not

732
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,919
going to have microbes

733
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,600
if it is going to have microbes then

734
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,080
design everything around that if it's

735
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:14,399
not going to then

736
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,158
design it so that it's not going to it

737
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,000
is also easier to have microbes in

738
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,559
hydroponic systems where the solutions

739
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,960
are not recirculated for example if you

740
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,398
have a drain to waste setup where you

741
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,960
are just irrigating a plant in a

742
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:29,359
soilless medium then

743
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,120
inserting microbes there is far easier

744
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:32,719
than if you recirculated the solution

745
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,479
because the microbes are just going to

746
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,240
be there with the plan they're not going

747
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,079
to in your drip lines they're not going

748
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,240
to in your tanks they're not going to be

749
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,079
anywhere else so usually if you are

750
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,038
going to introduce micros in a system

751
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,038
like that

752
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:47,839
usually you're not going to have a

753
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:50,960
problem when you do that

754
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:52,879
i consider them useful like uh

755
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,038
another point is that microbes can also

756
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,600
help you with pathogens there are

757
00:27:55,038 --> 00:28:00,960
microbes that are not for the plant but

758
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,319
for fighting pathogens so while they

759
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,558
might not help you with the optical

760
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,720
nutrients for the plant just the fact

761
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:09,038
that they're feeling an ecological niche

762
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,038
in the root zone will mean that

763
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:13,599
something else that's pathogenic will

764
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,278
not be able to fill it so

765
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,038
furthermore there are some microbes that

766
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,880
will actively fight

767
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:19,679
things that are there for example if you

768
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,278
have

769
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,159
um

770
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:25,919
let's say root aphids and you how you

771
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,600
inoculate your media

772
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,080
with um

773
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,839
poverty of asiana or with other microbes

774
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:33,359
that are pathogenic to root aphids then

775
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,480
they will fight their relations when

776
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:39,439
they get there so microbes are insurance

777
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,839
in my view they are something that we do

778
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,000
not need to grow perfect

779
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:46,639
if we can grow perfectly if you are not

780
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,640
perfect then i think that it's

781
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,240
not going to hurt you if you add them

782
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,159
and you have designed your system so

783
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,519
that adding them is beneficial i agree

784
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,720
when you said it was a controversial

785
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:59,599
topic because i get a lot of people that

786
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,880
are arguing both ways and so thanks for

787
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:04,079
bringing some clarity on that avenue

788
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,240
i want to switch it up i want to get

789
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,199
into silica next talk to us about

790
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,319
silicon and silicates in hydroponics

791
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,480
okay

792
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,398
so silicon is not an element that's

793
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,759
necessary for plant life

794
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:18,158
at least for

795
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:20,960
many uh plants like there are some

796
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:24,960
plants like grasses that require silicon

797
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:27,360
but for plants like tomatoes cucumbers

798
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,798
lettuce you don't really need silicone

799
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,398
for them to live

800
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,798
we have found through research that it

801
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:34,239
is beneficial uh there's a lot of

802
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:35,839
research in the scientific community

803
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,839
showing that if you can get silicon into

804
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:40,398
a plant then it will

805
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:42,558
at the very very least protected from a

806
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:44,959
fungal pathogens like that we have so

807
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:46,480
much evidence for that we already take

808
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,759
that as fact

809
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,120
um but how do you get it into the plants

810
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:52,960
the problem is that the chemistry of

811
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:54,879
silicon is tricky

812
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,200
most of the silicates that we have most

813
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,240
of the minerals that contain silicon

814
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,080
are not soluble they are just not going

815
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,120
to dissolve in water

816
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:07,038
so how do we get silicon in the water

817
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:09,439
so we have these products that are

818
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:11,440
called we have these types of minerals

819
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,440
called silicates and some of these

820
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,519
silicates like calcium silicate

821
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,360
potassium silicate and sodium silicate

822
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:22,398
are soluble in water at really high ph

823
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:24,319
so if you have a ph of above 11 then all

824
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:24,609
of these will be solvable

825
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,000
then

826
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:27,678
[Music]

827
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,440
as soon as you you can create a

828
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,440
concentrated solution of these silicates

829
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,200
they're dissolved in water then you can

830
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,200
add a little bit of that to a solution

831
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,759
to a hydroponic solution

832
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,000
and at the ph that you have in

833
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:41,278
hydroponics between five five and six

834
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,440
five let's say

835
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,519
all that silicate will be transformed

836
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,558
into silicic acid

837
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,798
which is a form that is available to

838
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:53,359
plants for their uptick

839
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:55,440
there is there are some hypotheses that

840
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:57,199
other slightly larger forms of silicon

841
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,798
are also available to plants very

842
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,960
difficult to test it

843
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:03,200
the issue is that these silicic acids

844
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,480
these monoxilicic acids are extremely

845
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,840
unstable under ph between in their phs

846
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,319
between four and eight they are

847
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:12,000
extremely unstable so they will quickly

848
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,480
polymerize and

849
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,359
be unavailable for the plant

850
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,200
so

851
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,398
that's the main issue with this

852
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,960
chemistry

853
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:23,278
now there are some products that will

854
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,440
give will not give you silicates the

855
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:28,398
basic solutions but they will give you

856
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,519
monoxilicic acids stabilized monoxylacic

857
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:34,879
acids which can exist in a stable form

858
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:37,200
at a ph below two so if you have these

859
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,919
silicic acid with molecules that can

860
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,240
stabilize its structure at a ph below

861
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:45,919
two then it will not polymerize because

862
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,558
this polymerization forms quartz like um

863
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,320
silicon dioxide which is insoluble or a

864
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:51,038
silica gel basically

865
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:52,639
so

866
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:55,278
you can have those these two extremes

867
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,120
now when those stabilized elastic acids

868
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,960
get put into a hydroponic solution at a

869
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:02,239
ph of five eight

870
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,159
or 55265 the question is

871
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,000
are they polymerizing as well or are

872
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,000
they not

873
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,319
so far

874
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,839
very few people have studied this

875
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:13,759
however we know that there are some

876
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:16,079
differences in availability of some of

877
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:18,640
these stabilized elastic acids there are

878
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:21,439
several i mean probably a handful of

879
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,679
studies right now that are showing that

880
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,640
it is different

881
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,759
and

882
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,080
then

883
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:30,960
monosyllabic acid derived just from

884
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:34,398
silicates that whose ph has been dropped

885
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,679
to the ph in hydroponics so which is

886
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:38,798
better

887
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,798
for root uptake we don't know there is

888
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:44,079
also the question of foliar feeding of

889
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:46,398
silicon if you feed silicon through

890
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:48,240
the leaves and not through the roots

891
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,079
then you need to consider that silicone

892
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,759
is completely immobile once it is

893
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,000
mobilized inside a plant and placed

894
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,679
somewhere it will not move so this means

895
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,200
you need to routinely apply it because

896
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,038
tissue that grows after you do the

897
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,759
foliar will never get the silicone that

898
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:03,759
you applied before

899
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:05,919
is it better to apply one form or the

900
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:08,000
other right now it is

901
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,519
unknown it is unknown evidence is

902
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,159
pointing to the fact that it is not

903
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,640
exactly the same but

904
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:17,039
acilisic assets ability like a

905
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,278
stabilized silicic acids properties will

906
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:23,200
depend heavily on what it was stabilized

907
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:25,759
for and how that was achieved

908
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,840
there are many there are maybe like 30

909
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:30,000
ways to achieve that so

910
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:32,558
it is a when things are marketed as

911
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,440
monocytelicic acids just bear in mind

912
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:36,480
that

913
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,880
what sort of stabilized monoxilicic acid

914
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,880
when mixing silica into a reservoir it's

915
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,720
generally recommended to mix that in

916
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,399
first and then mix in your other

917
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,319
nutrients can you talk to us about why

918
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,599
that is and then also what order

919
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:49,678
nutrient should be mixed into your

920
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:52,558
reservoir yeah so

921
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:56,240
normally you will mix the silicates

922
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,960
first because silicates are more stable

923
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,200
in

924
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,200
dilute solutions if they encounter a

925
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,600
solution that has more things in it more

926
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,480
cations and more anions it is bound to

927
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:08,878
be less stable and polymerize faster so

928
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,240
you add it first because the least

929
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,078
amount of things that your solution is

930
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,479
that we're going to have will be the

931
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,399
when it's like our water or tap water

932
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,320
when it's when it has when you have

933
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:20,239
added nothing else so you add the

934
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,559
silicon to that and when you add the

935
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,638
silicon the ph will be higher and it

936
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,960
will be a little bit more stable

937
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,358
normally you will inject silicone first

938
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,960
then you will inject whatever is more

939
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:33,759
acidic

940
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,878
which is normally a solution containing

941
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,960
acidic potassium phosphates of some sort

942
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:39,918
which is normally micros and potassium

943
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,679
so

944
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,480
more potassium phosphate or things like

945
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,200
this so silicate then this acidic

946
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,358
solution then the nitrates usually go or

947
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,199
the calcium containing solutions

948
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,759
and then finally you will set the ph

949
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:56,638
with an acid and to the final ph that

950
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,119
you want that is normally a way that

951
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,640
works well it is not the only way like

952
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,559
you could also for example do at the

953
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,960
silicon then

954
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:09,358
set the ph then add the other things

955
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,960
then set the ph again although that is

956
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:15,039
not very effective in terms of like the

957
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,960
amount of control that you require so

958
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:19,199
this is the standard what i've mentioned

959
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,280
is usually the standard it is also very

960
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,039
common to put a mixing chamber right

961
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,200
after the silicon especially if you're

962
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,519
using an injector system

963
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:29,279
because the silicates if they are not

964
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:31,440
fully mixed into the solution then they

965
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,519
can precipitate when the next injector

966
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,519
injects things into the line

967
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,039
if you are mixing into a large reservoir

968
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,199
by hand then you need to ensure that

969
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:40,639
that's properly mixed before adding the

970
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:42,960
the other

971
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,559
nutrients to your solution

972
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,559
gotcha okay

973
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,960
another controversial one i wanted to

974
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:50,799
touch base on is that gypsum so here

975
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,800
people adding in gypsum into their

976
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,480
hydroponic systems

977
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,839
and uh there's others that say you

978
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,880
shouldn't do that because it's not

979
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:58,880
soluble

980
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,358
give us a low down on gypsum with

981
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,280
calcium sulfate and hydroponics i have

982
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:06,078
an entire video on just this like

983
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:09,200
precise topic of gypsum in hydroponics

984
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:12,160
and gypsum is not as soluble as many

985
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:14,719
things it's not calcium nitrate but it

986
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:17,519
is very soluble like it is

987
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,759
i mean it is not as insoluble as many

988
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:22,880
other things it is not a rock phosphate

989
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,280
it is way more soluble than that so

990
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,400
it is definitely not soluble enough for

991
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,800
you to prepare

992
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,800
a concentrated solution of gibson to use

993
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,599
in your hydroponic setup that will not

994
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,720
work

995
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,280
but

996
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:36,639
you can get 400 ppms of calcium from

997
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,280
gibson

998
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:40,960
like from gypsum i mean it is soluble

999
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,000
enough that you could dissolve enough to

1000
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,599
supply

1001
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,400
more than double the nutrient

1002
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:49,599
requirement of the highest calcium

1003
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,960
requiring plant in a hydroponic solution

1004
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,200
however you would need to add it

1005
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,280
directly to the to the final nutrient

1006
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:57,279
solution you cannot as i mentioned

1007
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,040
prepare a concentrated solution and then

1008
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,160
add it you will need to add it to the

1009
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:03,759
final solution and then you have one

1010
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:06,639
thing and it's that the kinetics of the

1011
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,640
solution of the gypsum are slow so it

1012
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:11,440
will take time for it to dissolve it

1013
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:13,598
will take time in the order of maybe

1014
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,639
hours for it to properly dissolve in a

1015
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,800
solution

1016
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:18,960
another thing that gypsum has that is

1017
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,160
quite tricky is that its solubility goes

1018
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,720
down as temperature increases so you

1019
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:27,358
need to mix it at pretty low temperature

1020
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:30,239
so if you have a solution that's above

1021
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:32,078
70 fahrenheit then gypsum is going to be

1022
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:34,719
less soluble than all the solubility

1023
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,480
that could have so yeah it can be used

1024
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:38,719
so under

1025
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,760
precise conditions

1026
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:41,759
okay

1027
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,960
getting a little bit deeper into water

1028
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,640
temperature

1029
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,639
what is the optimal water temperature

1030
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:50,960
when growing hydroponically

1031
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:53,118
so in most cases i would say that around

1032
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,519
70 fahrenheit is the optimal temperature

1033
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,680
for roots in general

1034
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:00,639
you can grow at a little bit higher

1035
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:02,879
temperature and that can be optimal for

1036
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:04,639
some plants under some conditions but

1037
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,200
then we start getting into the point you

1038
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:08,719
know oxygen solubility goes down as the

1039
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:12,000
temperature goes up

1040
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:14,959
so if it's a system that has

1041
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,800
issues with its oxygenation then that's

1042
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,559
not going to help it all for example if

1043
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,200
you have a media that retains too much

1044
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,960
water between irrigations

1045
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:25,118
that's not going to help at all so

1046
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,760
normally if you're at 70 that's perfect

1047
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,079
if you are at 75 plants can most plants

1048
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,480
can tolerate that if you are at 80 then

1049
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,560
you're gonna have low oxygen and fungal

1050
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,519
and bacterial issues because especially

1051
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:39,039
anaerobic bacteria

1052
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:41,358
will love

1053
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:43,119
solutions that are low in oxygen and

1054
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:47,598
high in temperature

1055
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:49,838
to the low side then when you go 265 you

1056
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:52,320
might still be able to do fine but the

1057
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:54,078
problem is that the kinetics of nutrient

1058
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,640
transport becomes slower as the

1059
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,039
temperature drops so the uptake of

1060
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:01,199
nutrients becomes more sluggish

1061
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,279
so you start having issues with the

1062
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:06,719
uptake of some things and then when you

1063
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:09,839
drop below 65 phosphorus uptake drops to

1064
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:11,279
basically zero because it does require

1065
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:12,719
substantial

1066
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,480
i mean it does require the temperature

1067
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,959
for the uptake because of these kinetics

1068
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,440
of uptake so if you drop the temperature

1069
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,760
below 65 you'll start noticing that your

1070
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,800
plants will basically turn purple

1071
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,280
and

1072
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,519
because of because of that

1073
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,880
which some people use to their advantage

1074
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:32,800
yeah the water temperature is one of my

1075
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,119
biggest concerns uh yeah i live in a

1076
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,200
desert region and i think right now it's

1077
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,440
at uh okay in this room right here it's

1078
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,358
at 81 degrees fahrenheit i turned off

1079
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,119
the ac for recording blah blah blah

1080
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:45,759
usually it's about 78 but water

1081
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,400
temperature what i heard is over 75 is

1082
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,640
really you're at risk of those pathogens

1083
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,599
happening right and so uh i've just

1084
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:55,838
avoided dwc you know hydroponics in

1085
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,280
general because of that reason why but i

1086
00:39:55,838 --> 00:39:58,960
know there are hacks around it some

1087
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,320
people add in like frozen water bottles

1088
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,800
into the reservoir to lower the

1089
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,720
temperature some people buy a chiller to

1090
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,800
add to reduce the water temperature so

1091
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:08,239
there are solutions for controlling it

1092
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,560
but and if you're adding in a chiller

1093
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,239
year you have to consume more energy

1094
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,000
right and then do a cost analysis see if

1095
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:15,838
it's worth it or not so that's just one

1096
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,599
of my biggest things that i've avoided

1097
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:20,239
hydroponic growing for is water

1098
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,760
temperature alone so just just to tie to

1099
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:23,919
the previous topic

1100
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,079
one of the things that mainly limits

1101
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,079
kratky usage is water temperature

1102
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,240
because if the water gets hot then it's

1103
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,079
not going to work at all so that's the

1104
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,799
main limiting factor

1105
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:37,519
as you say normally plants tolerate

1106
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:41,200
warmer air way better than warmer water

1107
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:45,358
because warm air still contains um

1108
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:47,439
20 oxygen so plants will do much i mean

1109
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:50,279
if you're growing in a hot region it is

1110
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:54,400
much better to do something like

1111
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:56,880
a dutch bucket or a system that is like

1112
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,920
a drain to waste system with cocoa

1113
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,838
because that way you can very easily

1114
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,639
control the temperature even if your

1115
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:06,358
plants get hot water for like water at

1116
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:09,199
85 for

1117
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:10,960
a few minutes or 30 minutes while you

1118
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:14,078
irrigate them they will still get the

1119
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,119
air soon after so it's way way less

1120
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,599
troubling

1121
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,880
okay that's good to know

1122
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,079
ph

1123
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,680
super important when it comes to

1124
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:26,400
hydroponics what ph is optimal for

1125
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:27,519
hydroponics and then stabilizing ph can

1126
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,440
you get into that a little bit because

1127
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:30,239
that's tricky for some people

1128
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,200
so

1129
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:35,759
the optimal ph in hydroponics for plants

1130
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,919
for most higher plants is going to be

1131
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,319
let's say between five eight and six two

1132
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,880
like if you wanna be narrow but plants

1133
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:44,639
can do well between five and six five

1134
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,680
that's really the reason that they do

1135
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:47,519
finding

1136
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:48,960
um

1137
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:50,318
it is

1138
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,358
very important to keep them in that

1139
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:53,920
region

1140
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:55,440
because when you go to the lower end you

1141
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,440
start getting

1142
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,599
very high uptake of some nutrients

1143
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,240
micronutrient uptake becomes way too

1144
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,400
high below five five and also sulfur

1145
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:06,239
uptake becomes way too low

1146
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,318
and then to the upside then you get

1147
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:10,000
issues with micro uptake becoming too

1148
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,639
low so that's like the main thing that

1149
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,800
happens is that your micro uptake just

1150
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:18,400
plummets especially iron uptake at high

1151
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,000
ph is super super low so

1152
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,440
that's why you need to take care of your

1153
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,480
of your ph

1154
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,480
now

1155
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,159
how do you make it stable there are two

1156
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,159
things that change your ph one is

1157
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:29,920
chemistry so

1158
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:32,239
what the chemicals that are actually in

1159
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,680
there when you prepare the solution

1160
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:35,439
but the most important thing that

1161
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:38,159
changes your ph is how the plant

1162
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,079
modifies the solution when it gets it so

1163
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:41,920
when the plant gets the solution it will

1164
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,000
uptake some things and release some

1165
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,920
things and those things that the plant

1166
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,880
uptakes and release heavily affect the

1167
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,119
ph

1168
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,680
and the best way to stabilize the ph of

1169
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,280
a solution and the media is to make sure

1170
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:55,679
that the ratio of the things that the

1171
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,920
plant uptakes causes as little of a

1172
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:01,519
shift in the ph as possible this

1173
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:04,480
normally means that you'll need to

1174
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:06,719
play with your ammonium to nitrate ratio

1175
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,679
so plants will generally uptake a lot of

1176
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:12,799
nitrate and push the ph up under normal

1177
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:14,799
circumstances most plants will do that

1178
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,880
they when they're especially in vegging

1179
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,640
phases they will push the ph up due to

1180
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,960
nitrate uptake so if you add some

1181
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:22,719
ammonium that ammonium is uptaken really

1182
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,039
fast and it counter balances that so

1183
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:28,239
that the plant does not modify the ph

1184
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:30,079
much trying to stabilize the ph of the

1185
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:32,959
solution itself

1186
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,480
is very problematic if you are not also

1187
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,440
catering to the

1188
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,000
chemistry that the plant wants to uptake

1189
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,079
because if you just try to add buffers

1190
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,199
or stuff to like force the solution to a

1191
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,480
ph the the and you feed things that the

1192
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:48,559
plant will

1193
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,159
uptake very drastically and dramatically

1194
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:53,199
affect the ph then it's going to be a

1195
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:55,279
losing game like the best solution that

1196
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:56,719
you have to control the ph is to make

1197
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,680
sure that the nutrients that you're

1198
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:59,838
feeding

1199
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:02,078
are actually

1200
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:03,199
buffering the nutrient uptake of the

1201
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,920
plant

1202
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:08,159
now you can

1203
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,838
buffer this nutrient uptake through this

1204
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:11,838
but there are other plants for example

1205
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:14,000
you have tomatoes that uptake massive

1206
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:16,719
amounts of potassium and will heavily

1207
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,639
acidify the solution at some points then

1208
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:20,959
in those cases

1209
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:23,118
you might want to use

1210
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,358
uh add more nitrate for example to

1211
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,480
counterbalance that

1212
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:28,559
extreme

1213
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,440
uptake of potassium

1214
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:31,199
so

1215
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,720
there are a bunch of

1216
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:35,039
strategies you can use in terms of the

1217
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:37,919
nutrient uptake but you need to consider

1218
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,838
the plan like just chemically adjusting

1219
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,639
the solution does not work that well

1220
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:44,400
however when you adjust the solution you

1221
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:46,239
can also consider the uptake when you

1222
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,358
adjust it for example a very common

1223
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:53,439
strategy is that when the ph increases

1224
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:55,440
you add nitric acid with ammonium in it

1225
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,358
so that you both replenish the nitrogen

1226
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,079
but you are also increasing the ammonium

1227
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:01,440
to nitrate ratio so that so that every

1228
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,519
time you adjust

1229
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,119
the probability of adjusting is lowered

1230
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:06,800
because you are shifting things a little

1231
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,838
bit every time you adjust

1232
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,960
so that sort of like smart adjustment of

1233
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:13,039
the ph

1234
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,159
and works better

1235
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:15,759
than

1236
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:17,679
um

1237
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,920
doing just adjustments with regular

1238
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:22,239
acids or bases and you'll notice that

1239
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,079
companies will often sell ph ups and ph

1240
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:26,719
styles that consider that take these

1241
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:29,119
into consideration like ph chaps are not

1242
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:31,279
just potassium hydroxide and ph downs

1243
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,800
are not just mono potassium phosphate

1244
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,720
they often include

1245
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,720
or phosphoric acid they include other

1246
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:38,559
things to help you

1247
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:40,959
buffer nutrient uptake

1248
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:43,119
okay so basically you're saying most of

1249
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,240
the causes are due to

1250
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:48,318
the fertilizer not being balanced for

1251
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:50,239
that plant so if somebody generally

1252
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:51,920
speaking if somebody is growing

1253
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:54,719
hydroponically and they continue to

1254
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,000
struggle with that stable ph they may

1255
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:58,159
want to consider going to a different

1256
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,199
fertilizer yeah they might consider

1257
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:02,799
changing their ratio of certain things

1258
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:04,879
in your fertilizer

1259
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,960
and so that they need to fight that less

1260
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:10,559
however there's also the case that some

1261
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:13,599
plants will be will grow way better in a

1262
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,480
way that is very destabilizing to the ph

1263
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,400
so

1264
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,719
that is also a

1265
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,440
counter to this like if you are going to

1266
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:23,838
be growing a plant at its maximum

1267
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,039
potential maybe your ph will never be

1268
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:27,279
stable

1269
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:29,679
man you you sometimes need to compromise

1270
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,680
that you can also for example let's say

1271
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:35,440
if you're using a drain to waste setup

1272
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,519
and you're irrigating with um a ph of

1273
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,880
six and then your runoff is always like

1274
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:43,519
six five seven you can then water at

1275
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,599
lower ph like at five five to like

1276
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:47,920
compensate that change so that your

1277
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,838
runoff does not shift that much and it's

1278
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,440
in the zone that you want it to be so

1279
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:53,599
you can also play with the in because

1280
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,000
what what matters is the ph of the root

1281
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,079
zone so in systems where you are

1282
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,440
watering and then that solution is not

1283
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,039
recirculated

1284
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,358
you need to consider that you are blind

1285
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:05,199
to the ph of the root zone and the ph of

1286
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:07,199
the input is not as important as the ph

1287
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:09,279
of the root zone that you're growing

1288
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:12,159
got it i did actually watch your video

1289
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,839
on runoff and ph really really good

1290
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:15,598
video i totally recommend it for anybody

1291
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:17,199
who hasn't seen it yet definitely check

1292
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,039
it out a lot of good information you

1293
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:22,639
clarify a lot of things in that video

1294
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:26,000
next up i want to get into ec or ppm

1295
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:28,239
what's the optimal range for hydroponics

1296
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,400
so this is an interesting question

1297
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:33,039
because different ions conduct

1298
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,358
electricity differently and therefore

1299
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:38,719
the ec of two solutions with different

1300
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:40,480
composition and they won't be

1301
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:43,279
they they're they won't be chemically

1302
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,599
equivalent to the same ec so what i'm

1303
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,720
saying is that while you might be at a

1304
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,880
certain ec that works well for

1305
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:52,318
a given nutrient composition then if you

1306
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,720
have a nutrient composition that is

1307
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:56,079
substantially different then that same

1308
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:58,239
ec

1309
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,880
will not be equivalent

1310
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:03,919
so this is why talking terms of vc is a

1311
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,599
little bit misleading because then

1312
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,599
a person might say hey i grow out and

1313
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,599
you see a 1-5 and it works great and

1314
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,440
another person might say well i grow a

1315
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,480
two and then the solutions are very

1316
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,079
different

1317
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,079
and then when you look at what the

1318
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,839
actual osmotic pressure of the solutions

1319
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,599
is they might be the same at one five

1320
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:23,039
and a two so

1321
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:25,280
it is it is not a good practice and i

1322
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,400
know why it's so common but i think it

1323
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,280
would be

1324
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,358
um it is more

1325
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,119
uh useful if

1326
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:34,880
people only do easy comparisons when

1327
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,800
they're talking about like the same

1328
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,800
nutrients right

1329
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,599
otherwise i prefer to think instead of

1330
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,680
dc what are the optimal nutrient ratios

1331
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,280
in hydroponics like what are the optimal

1332
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:47,279
nutrients to grow in

1333
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,200
and that we can have a deeper

1334
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,440
conversation about and

1335
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:53,358
like that goes into like the

1336
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,119
formulations that are better for each

1337
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:57,358
plant according to the tissue that each

1338
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,960
plant is growing you know because like

1339
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:00,480
it's not the same to grow ahead of

1340
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,920
lettuce than it is to grow a tomato

1341
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,039
because in one case we're growing fruits

1342
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,639
and in the other kids we're growing

1343
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:07,279
leaves so

1344
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:09,039
what tissue are you growing and then

1345
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,440
your nutrients need to cater to whatever

1346
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:12,880
tissue you want to be grown yeah i was

1347
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,639
going to say that the type of plant

1348
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,160
would certainly have an impact on it as

1349
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:18,558
well all right one more controversial

1350
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:20,000
topic for you and i know people are

1351
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,200
going to love this one

1352
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,440
flushing

1353
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:25,598
is there any science behind flushing

1354
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,920
particularly medicinal plants prior to

1355
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,599
harvest when growing in hydroponics or

1356
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,960
actually growing in general

1357
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,640
so

1358
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,800
um

1359
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:35,838
the question is do you

1360
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,960
is there

1361
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:41,199
a need to flush like is there

1362
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:44,000
should we always flash it does flashing

1363
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:45,598
accomplish anything so flushing really

1364
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,639
does not take anything out of the plant

1365
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:51,039
the conception that the like the concept

1366
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:52,639
and this idea that the plant will lose

1367
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:54,960
nutrients because your flush is

1368
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:57,519
completely false like the plant will not

1369
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,880
lose any nutrients it already has taken

1370
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:02,559
up due to flushing so that won't happen

1371
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,680
what you will do is that you will

1372
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,160
completely

1373
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:08,078
um you will reduce the concentration of

1374
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:10,318
nutrients in the root zone

1375
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,720
so do you need to do that because if

1376
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:15,519
you're growing at very high easy values

1377
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:17,919
in the root zone maybe lowering the ec

1378
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:21,039
will give the plant some breathing room

1379
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:23,680
and it will be able to grow better for

1380
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:27,039
let's say that ending period

1381
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:30,000
but are you growing at like the same

1382
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:32,159
stable easy nutrient concentration the

1383
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,599
entire time and then if you flush then

1384
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:35,440
you're gonna deprive it of those

1385
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,960
nutrients in the end

1386
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,159
do you want to deprive it of those

1387
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,800
nutrients and i don't see why you would

1388
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:46,318
like you are going to be wasting some of

1389
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,559
the most efficient like the ending part

1390
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:50,639
of the growing cycle is the part where

1391
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,040
you get the most yield because it's

1392
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:54,799
where you have the most structure to

1393
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:56,000
build into so

1394
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,318
um

1395
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,159
it depends can you benefit from it if

1396
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:02,480
you can't benefit from it then you

1397
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:04,399
should use it if you cannot benefit from

1398
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,760
it because your conditions do not allow

1399
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,838
you to benefit from it then you

1400
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,520
shouldn't

1401
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:12,000
because there is that's why there is a

1402
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:14,480
big disconnect sometimes when

1403
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,719
you talk about people who

1404
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:20,079
like plant scientists who grow the

1405
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:22,799
plants perfectly and then they say well

1406
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:24,720
i flush and it's absolutely no benefit

1407
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,640
to me i see a detriment and it's like

1408
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:27,439
yeah well because you're growing this

1409
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,000
way

1410
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:32,400
and but if you grew this way where you

1411
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,599
have all this much higher ec in the

1412
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,358
media then you would see a benefit so

1413
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:40,240
whether you see a benefit or not depends

1414
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:41,920
on whether you need it or not so

1415
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:44,318
it is definitely not something that

1416
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,240
should be considered as a

1417
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:49,199
should always be done

1418
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:50,399
it should be done when it's necessary

1419
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:52,879
that makes sense

1420
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,599
so taking a step back and taking a look

1421
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,519
at the folks that are new to hydroponics

1422
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,800
what advice do you have for those that

1423
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:01,599
are new

1424
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,680
so for people who are new to hydroponics

1425
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,960
i would say

1426
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:06,799
you can

1427
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,639
start very

1428
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,480
a very simple level hydroponics is a

1429
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:13,039
great way to grow plants

1430
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,838
you have a lot of control that is both a

1431
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:17,599
blessing and a curse because then you

1432
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:19,119
need to realize that you are very likely

1433
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,079
to fail

1434
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,000
because you have all the power so in

1435
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,920
soil there are a lot of mechanisms that

1436
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,159
are working in your favor without you

1437
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,159
doing anything in hydroponics you have

1438
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:31,920
total control which means you have total

1439
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:34,159
responsibility over the fate of the

1440
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,960
plant and it's very likely that you will

1441
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:39,039
kill several plants and that's not a bad

1442
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,440
thing i think all of us who have ever

1443
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:44,079
grown plants have probably a lot of

1444
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,960
those plant carcasses in our closets

1445
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,680
so

1446
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,599
it is not anything to be afraid of and

1447
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:51,838
you can try small systems i would say

1448
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,599
start small and

1449
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:55,519
depending on your region i would say you

1450
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,960
can if you are in a cool cooler region

1451
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:58,960
where your temperatures are fine you can

1452
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,519
try kratky method or if it's a small

1453
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,199
indoor thing if you want to grow at

1454
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:05,440
outdoors then you might want to try a

1455
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:07,519
soilless media type of thing like a

1456
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,480
cocoa grow or something like that where

1457
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:09,519
you have

1458
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,159
um

1459
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:14,079
a little bit less concern over the

1460
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,318
temperature of the water and things like

1461
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:18,079
this but don't be afraid of it i think

1462
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:20,719
that's the main thing don't be afraid of

1463
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:23,119
it it can be done simply and can be done

1464
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:25,439
in a very complicated manner and there

1465
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,039
are nutrients that are very low cost

1466
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,920
that you can use

1467
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:31,759
just go ahead and try i like asking that

1468
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,599
question towards the end of the episode

1469
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,440
because it gives the guest a chance to

1470
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,680
speak on something they didn't speak on

1471
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,119
the episode and also provides a ton of

1472
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:40,960
tips like everybody who asks that

1473
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,800
question to just provides so much good

1474
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,800
information you know specifically for

1475
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,480
beginners because a lot of the audience

1476
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,318
a lot of them tuning in right now are

1477
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,440
beginners they're just getting started

1478
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:51,838
maybe they're in a state that just

1479
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,358
legalized for example a certain plant

1480
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:55,358
that they can grow and now they're

1481
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:57,598
starting to grow so i'm having that

1482
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:59,759
advice for beginners it's super valuable

1483
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,280
to a lot of people so thanks for sharing

1484
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,359
that another question i asked towards

1485
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,960
the end is how can the listeners find

1486
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:06,318
you and what do you have upcoming in the

1487
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,559
future

1488
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:10,239
also i have my website

1489
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:12,480
sciencinghydroponics.com

1490
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:14,558
where i talk about the science of

1491
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,800
growing plants without soil and i try to

1492
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:19,119
go into the scientific literature

1493
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:22,839
and i try to address topics in a manner

1494
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:25,280
that is more evidence based than other

1495
00:54:22,838 --> 00:54:27,679
sources i also

1496
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,760
have my youtube channel

1497
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:31,598
and science in hydroponics as well and i

1498
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,000
also have my instagram with the same

1499
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,200
name and you can find me in all of these

1500
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,079
places

1501
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:39,919
um

1502
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:42,798
i do general i do consulting for

1503
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:45,358
small to large hydroponic growers i am

1504
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:47,679
one of the only consultants that you can

1505
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:49,358
get on the hour

1506
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:51,118
because most of the large-scale

1507
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:54,558
hydroponic consultants would never

1508
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:57,039
consult with you without like uh

1509
00:54:54,559 --> 00:55:00,079
like consulting contract

1510
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:03,039
i've kept my hourly consulting basically

1511
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:06,240
to allow people who have

1512
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:09,358
um to allow the little guy a chance to

1513
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:11,838
like uh benefit from my experience and

1514
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:13,759
also the experience of other consultants

1515
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:16,000
and growers i work with

1516
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:18,720
so that um

1517
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,039
the consulting is not monopolized by by

1518
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:22,879
the big guys that's really cool that you

1519
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:24,159
offer consulting like that not a lot of

1520
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,920
people do and there are a lot of people

1521
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:28,000

1522
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,920
