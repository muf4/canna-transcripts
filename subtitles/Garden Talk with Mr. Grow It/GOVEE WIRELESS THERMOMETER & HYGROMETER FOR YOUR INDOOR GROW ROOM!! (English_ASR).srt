1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,780
what's up everybody feel that don't know

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:05,490
me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:07,919
you're watching my extras channel I've

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,099
got an unboxing and short walkthrough

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:13,500
for you today this is the gold wireless

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,138
thermometer and hygrometer this one is

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,460
actually Wi-Fi enabled they do have a

8
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:20,099
different model that is a

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,019
bluetooth-enabled basically this unit

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,939
not only tells you what the temperature

11
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:26,099
and humidity is when you're standing

12
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,719
next to unit but it also includes an

13
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,670
application that you can download on

14
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,169
your phone and you'll be able to see

15
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,179
what the temperature and humidity is

16
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,130
through the app as well as set up alerts

17
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:37,469
and we're going to walk through that a

18
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,879
little bit later on this video first

19
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,308
let's start with the unboxing of the

20
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,979
unit so as you can see here very nicely

21
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,869
packaged in this separate box right here

22
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,599
there are a few pieces to where you can

23
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:50,699
assemble into a stand or you can use one

24
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,189
of the pieces as a wall mount and I'll

25
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,899
show you how to do that in a little bit

26
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:57,149
this card right here has a little bit of

27
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,799
additional information it gives an email

28
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,410
for support so if you need any support

29
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,959
you can email them and it shows what

30
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:07,048
their social media is as well and lastly

31
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,939
is the user manual okay so my cat Stella

32
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,830
has decided to join me

33
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,109
she's pretty interested in this as well

34
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:15,209
and in order to get it to function you

35
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:17,400
basically just pull out this tab in the

36
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:20,250
back and then as you can see the unit

37
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,540
has that turned on now I'll remove the

38
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,938
clear plastic film and the unit is now

39
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,700
operational you can now see both the

40
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:31,649
temperature and the humidity okay so I'm

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,560
gonna quickly unbox one more of these

42
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,259
they actually sent me over four units I

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,269
personally have multiple grow areas so

44
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,368
I'll be using this device in four

45
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:42,599
different areas actually and on this one

46
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,890
I'm gonna actually place it into the

47
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,199
stands so you can see here I'm

48
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,629
assembling the stand it just simply

49
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,210
slides in super simple

50
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:53,429
[Music]

51
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:55,868
for now I'll place this one on the floor

52
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,729
microspace typically what I'll do is

53
00:01:55,868 --> 00:01:59,769
I'll take a canopy temperature reading I

54
00:01:57,728 --> 00:02:00,728
have my sensor push hung at the canopy

55
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:03,310
level right now

56
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:05,709
but I may eventually switch it out on

57
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,359
the other device I am going to mount it

58
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,758
to the wall and I only need one of the

59
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,949
pieces out of that separate box not both

60
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,568
of them so the piece that the unit

61
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:15,879
actually slides into is what I'll be

62
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:18,250
using and then I'll take the 3m

63
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,650
double-sided tape that is provided in

64
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,949
the box as well and then I will stick it

65
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,950
to the wall

66
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:31,400
okay now we'll go into the app and we

67
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,169
will do a quick walkthrough so first of

68
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,150
course you've got to get the app it is

69
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:37,339
available on both iPhone as well as

70
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,890
Android so I just downloaded the app and

71
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,170
I now have it open I just clicked the

72
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:44,208
top right corner to start you can see

73
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:46,280
that they have several different pieces

74
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:48,709
that are compatible with this is not

75
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,259
just thermometers hygrometers you can

76
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:53,628
connect LED strip lights copper wire

77
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:55,370
lights LED bulbs they've got other

78
00:02:53,628 --> 00:02:57,318
lights and also additional smart home

79
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,870
accessories such as they do have like a

80
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:02,149
smart plug water leak detectors and so

81
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,219
on and so forth now the app is asking me

82
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,079
to sign in I actually need to sign up

83
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:09,199
this is the first time I've ever used

84
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:12,290
this okay so after signing in I am going

85
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:14,298
to add in the two devices so I simply

86
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:14,598
find the device on the list and click on

87
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:16,670
it

88
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:18,858
then it's gonna actually show which

89
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:20,780
devices are nearby so it can detect the

90
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:23,299
units that are on and you can simply

91
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,430
click them to activate them now it's

92
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:27,379
asking to hold down the button on the

93
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,659
device for three seconds to sync it all

94
00:03:27,378 --> 00:03:31,340
together which I'm doing right now and

95
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:36,459
as you can see once it's synched it

96
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,459
actually blinks it gives the opportunity

97
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:41,719
click done now I'm adding the second

98
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:44,079
device doing the same thing we're just

99
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:46,579
basically find the device on the list

100
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:50,090
hold down the button on the unit for

101
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:51,980
three seconds that it all sinks together

102
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,509
alright so in the app it is gonna show

103
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:54,738
the temperature and humidity as you can

104
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:56,329
see here it's actually one of the

105
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:58,959
devices is actually selected at the

106
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:02,000
moment and you can change this from

107
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,590
Fahrenheit to Celsius you can also look

108
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,598
at the data in different ways whether it

109
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,810
be look at it for the day look at it for

110
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,369
the week month or a year I obviously

111
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,860
don't have any data yet since I just

112
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,870
activated device so it'll take time for

113
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,639
that to accrue going back to the main

114
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,980
menu can see both the devices are

115
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,139
visible there and then browsing around

116
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,129
to some of the different menu options

117
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:24,400
here is where you can add more devices

118
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:27,379
like I talked about a little while ago

119
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:29,179
here's some more things miscellaneous

120
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:31,759
things in regards to their community and

121
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,189
then here there are different profile

122
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,319
options that you can change let's click

123
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:38,149
back into one of the devices and let's

124
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,949
set the temperature and humidity ranges

125
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:42,560
so as you can see here I'm setting the

126
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:44,478
temperature range first in order to

127
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,569
activate I need to slide over the alarm

128
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:49,189
me and then when we go back into the

129
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,719
main menu can see that it does actually

130
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:52,060
show what the range is right there on

131
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,380
the home screen which is pretty cool

132
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,478
again a link to this product will be in

133
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:57,860
the description section below I just

134
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:59,329
wanted to do a quick walk through today

135
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,550
to show you guys what it's all about

136
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:02,779
what do you think of this unit let me

137
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,699
know in the comments section below

138
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:06,319
and I'll leave it at that thank you so

139
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:07,740
much for watching and until next time

140
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:22,168
peace
