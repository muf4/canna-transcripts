1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,720
what's up everybody feel that don't only

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,639
my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and you

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,609
watch a mattress channel grass roots

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:11,189
fabric pots sent me over a custom two

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:13,468
foot by 10 foot raised bed and I figured

6
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:14,548
I'd film a video of me assembling it so

7
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:17,789
there certainly isn't your typical

8
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:20,189
fabric grow pod they use moisture lock

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,740
technology on all of their living soil

10
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:25,469
pots and beds basically what that is is

11
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:27,390
they use a piece of a waterproof fabric

12
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:29,460
around the entire container but they

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,618
leave a 4-inch aeration strip at the

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,870
bottom and what this does is it directs

15
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:35,909
moisture to better simulate the way root

16
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:38,159
systems dry in nature and when you water

17
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:40,289
the waterproof fabric prevents water

18
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,119
from draining to the sides of the pot it

19
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:43,469
directs it downwards and the fittings

20
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,140
that I'm showing on the screen right now

21
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,359
they do send them over with the fabric

22
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,878
pot but I did have to go to my local

23
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:54,299
hardware store and buy PVC so

24
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:56,640
identifying four pieces of 10-foot PVC

25
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:58,288
pretty cheap I think I spent like two

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,020
dollars and fifty cents for each

27
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,870
ten-foot piece and this is one inch PVC

28
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,760
I also need to purchase a PVC pipe

29
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:07,530
cutter I got this one from my local

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,180
hardware store but I'll provide an

31
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,769
Amazon link in the description section

32
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,900
below all the products is shown or

33
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:14,579
mentioned in this video will be linked

34
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,090
in the description section below I'll

35
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:19,769
need this drill with a Phillips head bit

36
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:22,049
they do include the bag of screws here

37
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:24,329
once the PVC is secured in the fittings

38
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,490
I will use these screws to secure them

39
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:28,469
and then last but not least I will of

40
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:30,539
course need the instructions ok so

41
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:32,219
following the instructions the first

42
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,350
thing I need to do is size out the legs

43
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,140
so I'm just placing one of the 10 foot

44
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:39,609
pieces of PVC up measuring it out and

45
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,620
then cutting it

46
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:44,409
then I'm gonna use that piece that I cut

47
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,780
to size out the remaining legs for this

48
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:49,359
two foot by 10 foot bed I'm gonna need

49
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,010
eight legs after cutting all the legs

50
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:55,409
with my PVC pipe cutter

51
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:55,410
I'm putting each leg into its fitting

52
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:02,319
next I'm going to size up the frames

53
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:05,469
crossbars I'm putting a piece of uncut

54
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:07,479
PVC through the bed's sleeve and cutting

55
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:09,520
at the vertical marking indicated on the

56
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,289
instructions and I'm using another one

57
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,600
of the legs as a guide so I know where

58
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:18,609
to cut after I've cut the PVC I'll use

59
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,739
this link to make as many crossbars as I

60
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,140
need in my case here with a two foot by

61
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,810
10 foot bed I'll need six pieces this

62
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:28,569
size after I've attached those crossbars

63
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,280
to the legs I need to size up and cut

64
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:34,539
the remaining crossbars which of course

65
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:37,330
are of a smaller size I've cut the four

66
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:39,159
pieces of this size which is needed for

67
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:48,239
this size bed then I'm going to attach

68
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:51,310
these pieces to their fittings and

69
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,469
lastly I'll use the provided screws to

70
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,879
secure the pipes in the fittings on the

71
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:58,000
instructions it says you can use a

72
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,979
mallet to seat the PVC into each fitting

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,159
for a snug fit but I didn't need to do

74
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:05,469
that mine slid in without issues alright

75
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:07,629
everything is complete here is the final

76
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:09,759
result this bed is now ready to be

77
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:11,079
filled with soil that's pretty much it

78
