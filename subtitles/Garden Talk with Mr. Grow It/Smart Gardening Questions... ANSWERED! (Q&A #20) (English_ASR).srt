6
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:14,939
make a quick announcement stash blend is

7
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,500
now released sash blend is a plan

8
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:18,539
additive that was developed by the from

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,278
the stash team and it has a whole bunch

10
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,340
of good stuff in it you can find out

11
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:25,740
more at stash blend.com all right let's

12
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:28,320
get into the episode

13
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:30,479
good day get a question my autoflowers

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,939
gorilla cookies are starting to show

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,100
white pistols when you recommend to

16
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:36,479
change nutrition so yeah Auto flour is

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,039
probably on the same light cycle

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,718
probably plan to be on the same light

19
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:43,259
cycle for the entire grow whether it be

20
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,300
18 6 20 0 24 0 whatever it may be you're

21
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:47,519
not really sure when to start feeding

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,199
those flower nutrients for me I

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,160
typically do it around 8 30. you know

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,200
what I mean I'll make that transition

25
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,699
day 30 40 if I'm a little bit late with

26
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,960
it but yeah that's usually when I'm

27
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,359
starting to see pistols and that's

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,399
usually when I'm transitioning over to

29
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,198
the flower nutrients I'm sure it can

30
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,759
vary from grower to grower you'll

31
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,140
probably hear a different answer from

32
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,959
different people depending on who you

33
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,439
ask I'm sure there's some people that go

34
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,478
four five six weeks in their using their

35
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:14,158
veg nudes then flip to their flowering

36
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,900
nudes you know they're just seeing that

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,118
transitional flower happening but for me

38
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,219
round day 30 40 is when I'm switching

39
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:22,920

00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,859
grow tent until you humidifier arrives

61
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:09,899
SO waiting on the humidifier huh man I

62
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:12,840
was in the same exact situation as you

63
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,280
quite some time ago and uh it's it's

64
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,098
funny though the creative things as you

65
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,360
can think of to do search online you'll

66
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:20,519
find a whole bunch of stuff but things

67
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,160
that I have done is the wet towel method

68
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,080
so I've taken a bunch of towels wetting

69
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,060
them like crazy and then hanging them in

70
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,440
the grow tent you know as far as how

71
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,878
much it helps it's obviously going to

72
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,079
depend on how much you're exhausting out

73
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:33,000
of the grow space if you're just

74
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,940
exhausting 24 7 you could easily just

75
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,259
rip that humidity right out but uh yeah

76
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:39,120
I'm at the common amount that people are

77
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:40,500
using will wet towels pudding like

78
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,959
containers that are filled with water

79
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,060
into your grow tent that kind of helps

80
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,519
but as far as how effective it'll be

81
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,259
really is dependent on kind of how much

82
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,300
you're exhausting out of there how wet

83
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:54,299
the towels are what you're you know

84
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,459
current humidity is as far as how much

85
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,560
will actually increase so there's lots

86
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,939
of variables on that one but those are a

87
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,979
couple things I could think of that off

88
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:03,479
top of my head what did I miss I know

89
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:05,759
there's some of you guys out there that

90
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,919
are doing that just that trying to add

91
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,598
in the humidity don't have a humidifier

92
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,399
there's no down in the comment section

93
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,199
below I asked this once before but do

94
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,019
you notice any smell from the cannon

95
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,899
troll if string if so during what stage

96
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:21,300
I'm actually going to be doing a full q

97
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,280
a video on the can of troll just really

98
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,900
do a q a live stream like this where I'm

99
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,239
just answering kind of troll questions

100
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,459
not sure want to have that scheduled so

101
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,158
definitely follow me on Twitch twitch.tv

102
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,658

103
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,579

104
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:37,139
notifications are on you can come in and

105
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,000
ask questions about the canadrill I will

106
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:40,979
answer this one here for you right now

107
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,479
of course almost immediately I

108
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:44,459
definitely did notice the smell

109
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,738
particularly when drying like I just put

110
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,719
two plants in there well I put one plant

111
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,219
in there filled everything up and this

112
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,799
was uh

113
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:54,840
six days ago now filled everything up

114
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,580
yeah it immediately starts to smell for

115
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,860
me you know what I mean like you have

116
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,019
the uh the drip pan on the back things

117
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,360
are dripping out and probably what's

118
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,680
happened is that's just volatizing a lot

119
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,659
of it's just volatizing coming into

120
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,459
there so definitely notice the smell my

121
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:10,199
girlfriend notices the smell that's when

122
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,000
it's most strong the strongest is during

123
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,738
the dry period Then when things are kind

124
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,900
of stable you don't really smell it as

125
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,759
much like for example I had the can of

126
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,160
troll kind of right next to my door and

127
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,139
outside my door there's a hallway and

128
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,759
the next next door over is my

129
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,680
girlfriend's office and she said she

130
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,419
smells it when she walks by that's it

131
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,860
just when she walks by she'll smell it

132
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:32,039
and it was really only during the dry

133
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,600
period now me I really I smell because

134
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,160
I'm sniffing for it you know whenever I

135
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,020
come into my office here and I have it

136
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,460
on other part of my office right next to

137
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:40,799
right behind me actually you can see it

138
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:42,060
and I'm drying and I do smell it but as

139
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,759
far as how strong I wouldn't say it's

140
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,259
like crazy strong to where like your

141
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,419
neighbors are going to be notified stuff

142
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,979
like that but uh like I mentioned if

143
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:51,719
you've got it next to a door into a

144
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:54,060
hallway way and you got people walking

145
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,380
by they'll probably sniff it out if they

146
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,720
know what the smell is of course or

147
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,978
they're just like

148
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,259
and then just keep moving past the door

149
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:02,639
as far as just storage though when I

150
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,040
just have stuff in stores it's not

151
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,840
actually drying I can't I can't really

152
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,759
tell during that time there's really

153
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:11,099
nothing dripping in the back drip pan

154
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,720
after the drying period anyways so but

155
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,500
yeah I have two plants drying in there

156
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,840
right now I let one dry for a few days

157
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,180
then I was able to kind of consolidate

158
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:23,698
it down into and then make room for

159
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,978
another plant that had smaller plant so

160
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,600
I got two plants in there right now and

161
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:29,879
things are going pretty good things have

162
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,039
always been pretty good so hands off I

163
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,800
love it I've come to really despise

164
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:37,019
trimming do you have any tips or know of

165
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,939
any devices to help expedite the process

166
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:41,639
one thing I'm looking to get my hands on

167
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:43,800
is a bowl trimmer now I know I know

168
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,379
there's a lot of controversy behind the

169
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,960
bowl trimmer seems like everybody that

170
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,699
has a bowl trimmer that I know really

171
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,799
enjoys it once they understand how to

172
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,020
start using it pigeons 420 for example

173
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,660
I'll give him a shout out he is somebody

174
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:59,399
who was skeptical about the bowl Tremor

175
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,919
ended up getting his hands on one and

176
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:03,779
just absolutely loves it and he gave

177
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,478
some good tips in regards to using it as

178
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:07,679
well like more larfier type bud when

179
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,478
you're putting it into that ball term he

180
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,639
says it doesn't work as well so it needs

181
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:12,899
to be kind of more dense and you kind of

182
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,340
get the hang of it you know it takes a

183
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:15,959
little bit to kind of get used to I

184
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:17,939
can't wait to get my hands on one to be

185
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,680
honest with you just to try it but there

186
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,259
are people on the other end that are

187
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,560
just like uh ripping off your trichomes

188
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,419
is destroying your buds so um yeah I

189
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,280
mean buy one at your own risk I guess

190
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:32,519
you could say if you do buy one you can

191
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,859
use code Mr Grow at 15. specifically the

192
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:36,599
AC Infinity one I think they have a I

193
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,280
want to say 16 inch and 19 inch I could

194
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,780
be wrong about that but yeah you get a

195
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,038
little discount with my discount code I

196
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:43,019
need to get my hands on one though

197
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,120
that's one thing that uh you know from

198
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:46,918
what pigeons was saying really speeds up

199
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,379
the process could you recommend a

200
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:51,659
cultivar that has a terp profile that

201
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:53,819
can be contained and in with the carbon

202
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,919
filter much of the wide Leaf cultivars

203
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:58,319
have a very strong odor that is not

204
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,299
scrubbed fully by filtration interesting

205
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,039
which carbon filter you're using that's

206
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,600
one thing I want to ask I also want to

207
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:05,279
ask what size growth space you're in and

208
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,500
what size carbon filter you have in that

209
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,719
grow space because that could certainly

210
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,699
impact it right airflow not all carbon

211
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,860
filters are created equal it's so hard

212
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,180
to you know verify which ones are going

213
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,160
to work better than others of course

214
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,019
maybe it's just a brand carbon filter

215
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,720
using maybe I don't know if using a

216
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:23,758
cheaper brand or kind of a more a brand

217
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,139
known for Quality could be the carbon

218
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,759
filter assuming it's not the carbon

219
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:30,418
filter well it must be I mean if it's

220
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,280
escaping any sort of smell something's

221
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:35,818
wrong now with the carbon filter because

222
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:37,439
I've grown a large variety of cultivars

223
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,020
and as long as the carbon filter is

224
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,060
hooked up properly then it's always been

225
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:43,439
working pretty good for me tricky

226
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,639
question I don't really know how else to

227
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,899
answer that to be honest with you

228
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,120
there's so much it's going to vary

229
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:50,698
whether or not it smells during during

230
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,199
the flowering period right higher more

231
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,699
terpenes are going to volatile right so

232
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,900
if you're lowering the temp you're not

233
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,120
going to have as many terpenes

234
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:58,439
volatizing so if you're worried about

235
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,660
smell that might be something you want

236
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,939
to do maybe run like a temp you know 75

237
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,400
78 degrees throughout the grow instead

238
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:06,719
of kind of going up into the low 80s you

239
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,459
know in theory you should have less

240
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,919
terpenes volatizing you should have less

241
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:12,598
smell but uh tough question yeah

242
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:14,639
interesting question wish I'd have been

243
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:16,740
a answer for you zero to one hundred

244
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,439
percent how far would you say you are

245
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,560
towards completing your book

246
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:24,899
65 yeah I've got uh I would say a

247
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,418
majority of the sections written you

248
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,679
know chapters written and um I'm

249
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:30,659
actually kind of going back and

250
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,879
scrubbing some of the first chapters

251
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,740
that I've written every day I'm just

252
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,719
writing trying to get this book going

253
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,538
things looking pretty good though you

254
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,760
know I'm uh kind of timeline I hate

255
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:43,679
saying timelines because uh you know if

256
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,299
I miss then all of a sudden you got that

257
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,579
those people reaching out to you and

258
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:49,679
like hey you've missed your timeline but

259
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,959
uh within the next two months I want to

260
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,939
completely September 1st I want to be on

261
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,219
to the next stages which is book design

262
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,500
obviously like the editing have send it

263
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,200
over to an Editor to review proofread

264
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,458
then it goes the actual design I'll

265
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,040
actually be collecting photos

266
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:06,838
photographies from you guys to see if

267
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,819
anybody wants to get their photography

268
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,680
featured in my book so keep an eye out

269
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,480
for that one on social I'll definitely

270
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,579
make just a ton of announcements I did

271
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,680
that last time and the submissions it

272
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,019
was so fun seeing all the submissions of

273
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:21,059
you guys and yeah I'm excited to see

274
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:24,120
some new photography that you guys

275
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:26,399
submit in but yeah about 65 I'd say so

276
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,320
far and I hope to have it a hundred

277
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,179
percent written and onto the whole

278
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,580
designing process and so on and so forth

279
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:34,199
come September you know early September

280
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:38,639
is what I'll say do you have any set

281
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:41,640
scale for weekly PPM or EC yes I do Josh

282
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,439
uh actually it's in my book which I'll

283
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:45,299
bust out right now you guys familiar

284
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,640
with this one or what there's a section

285
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:48,899
here for PPM I don't have EC in here

286
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,120
that's definitely going to be included

287
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:53,879
in the next revision I'll add like a

288
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,240
scale for EC but we flip to the PPM

289
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:59,458
section which is on page 68 of the book

290
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,778
General recommendation so some people

291
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,399
are going a little bit higher than

292
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:04,980
what's here some people will go on a

293
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,778
lower so after Sprout weeks the ceiling

294
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,259
stage week one vegetation some people

295
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:12,360
call it 100 to 250 PPM at a 500 we're

296
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:15,419
talking 500 scale PPM meter vegetation

297
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,539
stage wait weeks two to three 300 to 400

298
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:22,199
PPM vegetation wig weeks four and Beyond

299
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:23,699
typically from like 400 to 50 to 700 PPM

300
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,399
now if you're growing in a larger

301
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,778
container larger plant certainly you can

302
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,240
go higher than this right so these are

303
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:31,379
just general recommendations assuming

304
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,240
that you're growing like small to

305
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:35,220
medium-sized plants growing larger

306
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,519
plants you can definitely get away with

307
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:42,839
going higher flower stages one to four

308
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:46,860
750 950 PPM flower stage is five and

309
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:48,779
Beyond 1000 to 1600 PPM and then in here

310
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,039
actually one thing that a lot of people

311
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:52,078
used to do they don't do it much any

312
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:53,639
more is like reduce the PPM as much as

313
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,500
possible as you're getting close to

314
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,240
harvest so it says here two weeks prior

315
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,299
to harvest less than 100 PPM so this is

316
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,459
just if you are a flusher if you like to

317
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:03,899
flush if you want to go buy that method

318
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,159
some people will flush their plant

319
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,440
towards the end of the grow to try to

320
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,740
reduce the PPM as much as possible they

321
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,820
swear it brings better terpenes and

322
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,860
cannabinoids and better taste and all

323
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,778
that stuff but do that at your own risk

324
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,639
I feel like these days it's kind of an

325
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:19,439
outdated technique that not a lot of

326
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:20,819
people are doing that is something I

327
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,740
definitely want to clarify in the next

328
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,540
revision on my book what has been your

329
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,240
favorite cultivar to grow have you come

330
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:29,219
across any finicky ones yeah yeah I feel

331
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,959
like I've answered this question in a

332
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,959
past episode so I won't get too deep on

333
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:36,539
it but Queen Anne's Revenge by TGA

334
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,979
genetics formerly TGA genetics went to

335
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:41,159
sub cool seeds

336
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,720
think Miss Jill took over the Queen

337
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,980
Anne's Revenge that's definitely been

338
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,379
one of the favorite plants I've ever

339
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,778
grown beautiful plant I had magnesium

340
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:51,000
deficiency to begin it was real slight

341
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:53,578
easy to fix once I fix the magnesium

342
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,100
deficiency which I believe was late veg

343
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:57,299
early flour plant was healthy throughout

344
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,019
the rest of the grill I feel like it was

345
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:03,539
a real easy feeder dense buds top top to

346
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:05,339
bottom there was basically towards the

347
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:08,099
end when it's ready for Harvest it

348
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:10,560
changed colors covered in trichomes as

349
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,379
far as effects real narcotic effect

350
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,899
chill effect it's an entirely coach lock

351
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:17,700
side of things but uh definitely

352
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,078
narcotic effect that's the first thing I

353
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,879
think of when it comes to the actual

354
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:26,239
effects but yeah that's been my favorite

355
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:28,919
as far as finicky man Sour Diesel oh

356
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,620
historically you know yes people who

357
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:34,019
have who have grown the true Sour Diesel

358
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,440
and they'll tell you it's a challenge it

359
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:39,419
can be a challenge to grow that one mine

360
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,519
was very finicky very sensitive in

361
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:44,159
nutrients uh it would it did not come

362
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,078
out good at all I didn't even get a good

363
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,000
harvest from it you know what I mean so

364
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,799
yeah like I mentioned every time I talk

365
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,539
about Sour Diesel and kind of it's

366
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:53,879
difficulty or the difficulty that I have

367
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:55,379
I've had you definitely get a handful of

368
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:58,799
people that are like yep absolutely

369
00:12:55,379 --> 00:13:00,360
that's how she is it's not easy so but

370
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,639
it can be fun you know it could be a fun

371
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,959
challenge what happened to Mr Canuck I

372
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,459
heard someone was trying to steal his

373
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,500
channel from them by registering a

374
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:09,778
business with the Mr Canuck title I

375
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,519
don't know what happened to him yeah he

376
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:13,439
hasn't uh been posting as much lately

377
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,120
anymore but he's got some fantastic

378
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,800
videos videos of you guys that don't

379
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,078
know who Mr Canuck is I mean just search

380
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,120
for him on YouTube just amazing

381
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:23,278
cinematography and he's coming up close

382
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,839
to a million subscribers he might be the

383
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:28,799
first one to actually reach a million

384
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:30,540
subscribers in the community that has

385
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,458
that plant that we all know and love

386
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:34,679
uh but I don't know what happened to him

387
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:37,078
yeah I actually uh I found that out

388
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:39,778
trademark search if you do a trademark

389
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:42,120
search for Mr Canucks grow you'll see

390
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:44,399
that it's not him that owns it and uh so

391
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,919
somebody did it I don't know if there's

392
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,620
been anything beyond that as far as uh

393
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:52,679
people like threatening him or trying to

394
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,600
steal his channel from him because of

395
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:56,939
that but yeah maybe he'll uh come back

396
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,379
and start making some more videos soon I

397
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,820
really enjoy his videos really enjoys

398
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:02,100
content I've known him for many many

399
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:05,100
years I mean we've been in contact since

400
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:08,220
I think 2016 if I remember correctly and

401
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,839
uh man he has just grown more and more

402
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,079
he's gotten better and better when it

403
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,519
comes to his filming editing and just

404
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:16,979
when you think he somebody can't get

405
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,320
better at that you see him and he does

406
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:23,399
so I miss him hope he comes back soon

407
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:25,620
ever ran 18-6 last 10 days of flower not

408
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:29,759
that in particular but I have tried out

409
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:32,220
the 24-0 self non-stop light for the

410
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,740
last 48 hours of the grow I don't

411
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,600
readily have access to testing here so

412
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,339
I'm not able to kind of test the

413
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,500
cannabinoid profile terpene profile so

414
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:43,260
on and so forth of the two differences

415
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,198
and kind of report back what the change

416
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:48,059
was that was there but yeah so just kind

417
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:50,939
of looking to see if there was a

418
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:53,819
difference I didn't really see much if

419
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:55,620
anything so um and I haven't done the 18

420
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,540
6 for the last 10 days like you

421
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,339
mentioned there have you done it let me

422
00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:01,319
know let me know what your results were

423
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,660
is nicotine poisoning a real thing you

424
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,579
mean like tobacco mosaic virus because

425
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:07,439
that's uh that's certainly a real thing

426
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:10,259
nicotine poisoning on the plant are you

427
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,060
talking about like on humans yeah

428
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:13,439
tobacco mosaic virus I think that might

429
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:14,698
be what you're referring to yeah just

430
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,620
Google that and you can find out more

431
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:18,899
about it is there any tests that I

432
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:22,560
shouldn't be worried about or all pest

433
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:25,019
bad I would say there's pests that are

434
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,698
easier to manage than others one of the

435
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:28,919
ones that come to my mind right off the

436
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:31,799
bat is fungus gnats it's something I've

437
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:34,799
battled on and off but I feel like I am

438
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,659
able to easily get rid of and kill off

439
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,039
the population as needed you know you

440
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:40,198
just gonna have to have the practice and

441
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,759
know what to do several of the pests are

442
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:43,500
like really bad I mean there's some

443
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,659
pests where like you just can't recover

444
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,000
from it I mean we could sit here for the

445
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:51,139
next hour and go through pests I highly

446
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,480
recommend a podcast episode Garden talk

447
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:56,339
with Matthew Gates I don't remember what

448
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,139
episode it is just Google it I'll

449
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:01,079
actually search on YouTube Garden talk

450
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:03,659
Matthew Gates and great episode where we

451
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:05,458
talk about is it the top 10 pests and

452
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:07,198
how to battle them really really good

453
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:09,359
episode that guy has so much knowledge

454
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:11,099
in regards to it but uh yeah if you come

455
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,379
across fungus gnats I wouldn't be too

456
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,120
worried about it not sure what stage

457
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:16,860
what level you are how long you've been

458
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,940
growing for I know some people see

459
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,199
fungus gnats and they just start

460
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,399
panicking you know they think

461
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:22,078
everything's over and they gotta wipe

462
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,600
everything out that's just not the case

463
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,799
as long as you stay on top of it you

464
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,720
should be able to get rid of them pretty

465
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:28,799
easily and the way I like to do it

466
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,360
there's so many different ways to go

467
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,338
about it first of all yellow stickies to

468
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,240
identify it's not going to kill off the

469
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,240
populations but you can at least

470
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,639
identify and trap and kill some of the

471
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,379
ones that are active so yellow stickies

472
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,680
in every single pot is what I do I like

473
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:46,980
using the mammoth control which is their

474
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:49,620
their IPM product that they have and

475
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,959
that one uh I love using that thing to

476
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,459
knock up knock down populations and also

477
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,319
as a preventative as well that's been

478
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:58,138
one of the strongest things I've used

479
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,120
also Dr zymes is another fantastic

480
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:03,240
product that has helped out tremendously

481
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,619
for both preventing and for knocking

482
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,900
back some populations on some of those

483
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:09,298
pests so off top my head those are the

484
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,220
two main products that I can kind of

485
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:12,900
recommend and vouch for that I've used

486
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,640
and worked well but yeah kind of going

487
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,019
back to your question fungus gnats if

488
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,360
you do come across those I wouldn't be

489
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:20,639
overly worried about them also mosquito

490
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:23,159
bits is another main one that people use

491
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,900
that kind of helps with the larva it's

492
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,179
basically beneficial bacteria that helps

493
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,100
knock Back The larva population so look

494
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:31,679
into that as well and then diatomaceous

495
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:33,178
earth is something that uh is used by so

496
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,059
many people it's just having that in at

497
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:39,059
the top layer of the soil it's pretty

498
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:41,460
much like glass shards for those pests

499
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:43,019
and there is some controversy behind

500
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,298
diatomaceous earth and I'm not really

501
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:47,700
too ready to speak about it but there is

502
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:49,859
somebody who is concerned about their

503
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,200
effectiveness and there isn't really

504
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:53,879
studies on diatomaceous earth to knock

505
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,860
down fungus in that population in

506
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,960
particular so I won't get too deep into

507
00:17:55,859 --> 00:18:00,240
that one maybe I'll maybe I'll invite

508
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,620
Matthew Gates on to speak about that but

509
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,019
I've been using it anyways I have some

510
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:06,599
so why not use it doesn't do harm it's

511
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:08,940
uh it's really silica is what that is

512
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:11,819
have you switched from Earth dust to

513
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,679
kiss Organics for reamending soil yes so

514
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:16,678
I stopped using our dust unfortunately

515
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,360
green Sunshine Company is no longer up

516
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,400

517
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:22,319
business closed down yeah it's sad to

518
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,320
see them go you know very small company

519
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:27,418
I knew Dan personally he was actually on

520
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:31,019
my podcast we did several videos

521
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:33,720
together we had the electric sky ES1 80

522
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:35,579
and ES 300 very very popular I used them

523
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,679
for many many years and then the Earth

524
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:39,899
dust Amendment so unfortunately they're

525
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,059
no longer Earth dust is no longer being

526
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,038
made I actually reached out to him and

527
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:47,099
asked him about the manufacturing birth

528
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:49,500
dust and I've tried to bring it back and

529
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:51,000
uh doesn't look like it's feasible it

530
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,259
doesn't look like it's worth it to bring

531
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,640
it back is what kind of what I should

532
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:55,798
say so yeah I've been using kiss

533
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,460
