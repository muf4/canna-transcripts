00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,400
thanks to aeromixer for sponsoring this

2
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,879
episode with aeromixer you can throw

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,359
away your air stones and have one unit

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,440
that mixes and aerates it can also be

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,839
used as a pump to feed your plants it

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,920
can handle quarter inch particulates you

7
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,240
can dump your worm castings in back

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,160
guano in or any synthetic based

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,959
fertilizer they have models that range

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,278
from 15 gallon tanks to 2 000 gallon

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,039
tanks they also have an aero brewer that

12
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,840
allows you to control the power of your

13
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,759
aerial mixer and control on and off run

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,600
times check out their website at

15
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,479
aeromixer.com

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,679
and use discount code mr growit for 15

17
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,799
off do you have a soil recipe you prefer

18
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,159
i don't know how long you've been tuned

19
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,078
in my channels but for the most part

20
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,959
you'll see that i i use a lot of fox

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,198
farm ocean forest and just because it's

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,640
convenient local at my nursery so i'll

23
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,558
pick that up use that i do use that from

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,359
seed all the way to harvest of course

25
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:06,239
adding in amendments sometimes as needed

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,240
i have added in some alfalfa and insect

27
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,759
frass into my ocean forest before and i

28
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,359
got a really good result yeah i

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,960
definitely recommend trying that out and

30
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,879
a lot of people would be like oh that's

31
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,478
way too hot look up the benefits of

32
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,438
insect frass look at the benefits of

33
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,879
alfalfa meal and realize that no neither

34
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,559
of those things are in foxtrot motion

35
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,118
for soil i got some really good results

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,439
with that as far as mixing my own soils

37
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:30,078
honestly i've just been using the bag

38
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:32,158
soil and then reusing that bag soil for

39
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,319
example i'll amend it before i start

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,960
growing i'll mend it with build a cell

41
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,758
craft blend and then every 30 days i'll

42
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,478
do a cup of build a soil craft blend per

43
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,719
plant so that's kind of the easy organic

44
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,200
way to go about it try it out should you

45
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,118
slightly change ph in bloom to uptake

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,200
the bloom nuts better stay around the

47
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:54,078
same for the whole grow a lot of debate

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,520
behind this one some people will keep it

49
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,000
the same throughout the entire grill for

50
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,640
example in soil 6.5 ph a lot of people

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,920
say that's it do that and they have

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,840
healthy plants throughout the entire

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,560
grow some will drop it lower than that

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,920
6.0 even as low as 5.5 in soil believe

55
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,000
it or not which is something that you

56
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,559
don't hear about much you can definitely

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,560
have healthy plants at those ph ranges

58
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,439
as far as you know should you increase

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,159
the ph in bloom so it can uptake certain

60
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,400
nutrients look at the ph chart for

61
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,639
nutrient uptake you can just google that

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,120
find it online and you can see the

63
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,119
higher the ph the less availability for

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,560
some of these elements so just keep that

65
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,560
one in mind how do you know if your

66
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,400
meter is set to a 500 or 700 scale you

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,479
have to contact the manufacturer

68
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,400
so the manufacturer is going to be the

69
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,518
one to tell you whether or not your

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,840
meter is a 500 scale or 700 kilometer

71
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,159
what i did was i went to the actual

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,479
amazon listing sometimes you'll see it

73
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,840
asked as a question or it'll be in the

74
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,759
actual listing description whether it's

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,280
a 500 700 scale or you can ask a

76
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,039
question or again reach out directly to

77
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,280
the manufacturer and find out if the one

78
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:03,120
you're using is a 500 or 700 scale

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,120
what's a good ppfd for flour with no co2

80
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,879
i don't like going any higher than 900.

81
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,800
anytime i'm over 900 ppfd i'm talking

82
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,280
about 900 ppf to get the canopy there

83
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,519
with no co2 supplementation every time i

84
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,000
go over 900 can start to see some leaf

85
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,759
terms leaf burn symptoms of course but

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,439
uh as far as like

87
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,959
just the plant reading the plant and

88
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,840
seeing when the plant has too much light

89
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,598
and that's something you get with

90
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,959
experience right you'll see especially

91
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:28,079
when you blast it with so much light and

92
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,158
it comes to a point where it's a little

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,120
bit droopy oftentimes i'm just doing 800

94
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:35,759
ppfd with no co2 if i have a mother

95
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,599
plant in cocoa growing with synthetics

96
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,199
is it really bad to clone it into a

97
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:40,318
happy frog than transplanting into a

98
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,199
living soil

99
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:46,479
no not at all just understand the plant

100
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,679
has nutrient requirements and so if

101
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,079
you're giving the same nutrient

102
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,599
requirements in the living soil plant

103
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,280
should be fine i've always been in the

104
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,759
impression that clone should be the same

105
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,598
medium and nutrients at the mom you'll

106
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,438
hear people say that but look at the

107
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,479
science behind it we know that there are

108
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,560
17 essential elements for plants if

109
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,639
you're given those elements as needed at

110
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,120
the proper balance if you have an excess

111
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:11,518
of some elements in the medium

112
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,200
it can inhibit the uptake of other

113
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,879
elements so you need to have that proper

114
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,719
balance as long as you have a proper

115
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,120
balance of nutrients and the nutrients

116
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,359
that it needs within the medium the

117
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,759
plant should be fine do you empty it

118
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,879
into a large container and then mix soil

119
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,400
to reset

120
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,879
no i haven't been doing that i've just

121
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,959
been top dressing in and sometimes i'll

122
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,360
dig up and disturb the soil a little bit

123
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,599
but a lot of people's goal is no-till

124
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,639
no-till living soil is just being able

125
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,040
to add in amendments up top for example

126
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,360
and then not have to disturb do minimal

127
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,879
disturbance of the microbial life in the

128
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,960
soil so i've been doing the disturbing

129
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,279
and you know removing the root ball for

130
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,680
example as much like the the stock and

131
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,959
part of the root ball removing that then

132
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,040
there's a little area you know there's a

133
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,719
little hole there which i can work with

134
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,720
digging down a little bit more

135
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,479
mixing in that cup of amendments

136
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,320
backfilling with soil and then planting

137
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:05,918
my plant in there and that's been

138
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,639
working out pretty good for me so i

139
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:11,038
haven't had to remove the soil from that

140
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,360
seven gallon container mix everything up

141
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,519
nice and then add it back in but some

142
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,360
people do that it's a common technique

143
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,359
you can do it either way do you use bowl

144
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,439
trimmers or do you do by hand right now

145
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,120
i do by hand but i'm interested in using

146
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,160
the bowl trimmers asymphini has two

147
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,280
different sizes bold termers so um i

148
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,120
might have to get my hands on one of

149
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,279
those have you thought about trying grow

150
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,560
dots as an experiment things obviously

151
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,638
would be cool to see some bigger

152
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,199
channels give it a try

153
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,918
i picked some up i did pick some up so i

154
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,160
hope to try it on a future grow i'm not

155
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,079
sure when i'm gonna be able to try it

156
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,160
but uh yeah i have my hands on it right

157
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,599
now and i'll be trying it at some point

158
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,160
in the future do you have experience

159
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,240
with the auto parts yes i do i've done

160
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,199
several grows with the auto pots i've

161
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,038
tried it with both synthetic nutrients

162
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,199
in the reservoir and i've also tried it

163
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,599
with organics and

164
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,160
had some mixed results so i really like

165
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,560
the concept of auto pots for those that

166
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,720
don't know it's basically a bottom fed

167
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,319
system so you have a reservoir it'll

168
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,720
feed down to the basically the tray

169
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,319
that the grill pot is located within

170
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,840
it'll fill with water and then it will

171
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,039
wick up great system i was using it with

172
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,000
organics

173
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:26,560
had some success with it mixed success

174
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
when i was top dressing with organics so

175
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,000
if you're doing top dressing with

176
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,360
organics i wouldn't recommend it and

177
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,680
some people have done it and they get

178
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,240
away with it and they argue against

179
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,000
my opinion on it but uh in my experience

180
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,360
i haven't had good success with that the

181
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,600
reason why is because with this bottom

182
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,680
wick system it's gonna wick all the way

183
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,520
up but that top layer where your drop

184
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,319
your amendments are it doesn't really

185
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,240
get

186
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,240
the moisture level that it needs in my

187
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,918
opinion now i've tried having cover

188
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,918
crops on there i've tried having mulch

189
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,918
layers on top really keep that top layer

190
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,560
moist it works better

191
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:01,279
but i still felt like i've struggled top

192
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,720
dressing organics in the auto pots other

193
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,279
people have got another result so feel

194
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,440
free to try it that's just my experience

195
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,799
there with these synthetics grade

196
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,560
results i put a third dose quarter dose

197
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,879
of nutrients so less nutrients because

198
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,399
it's constantly being fed and got some

199
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,199
really really good results sometimes i

200
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:22,079
put just calmag in the reservoir and ran

201
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,240
it in there and uh got some good results

202
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,240
for when i just needed to supplement

203
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,918
calcium magnesium at the time make sure

204
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,240
that the liquid nutrients that they're

205
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,399
using isn't too thick could potentially

206
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,120
clog up the lines make sure you're using

207
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,439
the

208
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,280
copper disc that comes with the auto pot

209
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:40,160
i believe it can be either in the pot

210
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:42,159
and then the soil or it can actually be

211
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,439
like below the pot in the tray if you

212
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,400
don't use the copper disc basically the

213
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,639
roots will come all the way through the

214
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,878
bottom of the system and clog up the

215
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,120
the system so uh definitely use the

216
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,400
copper disk but yeah definitely got some

217
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,519
good results off of that i think they

218
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,839
came out with a larger auto pot now as

219
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:00,159
far as container size i believe the auto

220
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,799
pot xl is just under

221
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,120
four gallons of soil if i remember

222
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,120
correctly and they have larger pots now

223
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,360
in a different system so i would pr i

224
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,360
would probably go towards the larger pot

225
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,720
in the future if i were to use them

226
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,080
again but yeah i've used them several

227
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,840
times in the past and got some pretty

228
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,359
good results can you topdress if you

229
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,038
have cover crop or do you recommend tea

230
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,720
yes you can just might be a little bit

231
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,360
more difficult kind of working the

232
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,360
amendments down through the cover crop i

233
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,080
don't like to do it to be honest with

234
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,400
you teas sure you can do teas as well

235
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,958
that's gonna help boost the the microbe

236
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,639
population it will uh you know depending

237
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,399
on what you put in the tea if you put

238
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,598
something some amendments in there some

239
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,639
of them are gonna be

240
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,640
water soluble some of them aren't so

241
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,639
some of them will turn out to be

242
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,639
bioavailable fast acting the plant can

243
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,759
uptake it immediately others you might

244
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,679
have to

245
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,759
put that bag with whatever you have in

246
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,919
there compost worm casting amendments

247
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,919
use that as a top dressing after you

248
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,838
brew the tea so a lot of people do that

249
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,000
one yes long story show you can't top

250
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,600
dress with cover crop it's just not as

251
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,600
easy as if you didn't have the cover

252
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,320
crop you're gonna try ac infinity's auto

253
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,480
watering system yes i will absolutely i

254
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,120
just saw rob's video on it so big shout

255
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,360
out to rob from cltv he has a video

256
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,759
detailing how that works and uh

257
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,839
interesting interesting way that that

258
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,159
works definitely the only system that

259
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,959
works like that and they did send me

260
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,559
over one so uh yeah i think i'm gonna

261
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,399
try that out next girl we'll see how it

262
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,639
works seems like it could make things a

263
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,639
lot easier what's your cat's name my

264
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,240
cat's name is max

265
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,679
you guys see him floating around is that

266
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,440
oh there he is yep

267
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,039
he look usually comes to

268
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,720
comes onto the lap

269
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,319
but sometimes he's like no i don't want

270
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,160
to be on your lap

271
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,800
he just wants to rub up against me do

272
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:47,759
you think adding aloe is worth it as

273
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,519
what as a rooting hormone yes a lot of

274
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,439
people do use that for when you're

275
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,600
trying to get cuts to root

276
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,080
so yeah try out aloe i actually have an

277
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,759
aloe plant i had it indoors moved it

278
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,839
outdoors now it's actually struggling

279
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,639
with the heat outdoors but it's still

280
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,240
alive but yeah you can harvest aloe

281
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,639
right off the plant and use it as a

282
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,200
rooting hormone so there's tons of

283
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,759
videos online showing that i like the

284
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,959
one by green goblin 510 so if you search

285
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,000
youtube green goblin 510

286
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,559
aloe

287
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,679
his video should pop up and he gives you

288
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,838
details step by step on how to use it

289
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,759
very detailed he's got a ton of

290
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,200
knowledge big shout out to him i can't

291
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,838
recommend that video enough what would

292
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,680
be the best bang for my buck as far as

293
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,160
meters go that read temperature and

294
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,679
humidity i have the ac infinity inline

295
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,240
fan should i just stick with that what

296
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,799
they have now i currently use the sensor

297
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,560
push monitor i've been using it since

298
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,519
like 2017

299
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,838
i believe maybe in 2016 way back when it

300
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,679
first came out and i've had

301
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,200
great results using it it's a monitor

302
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,278
you can hang down i mean it's only i

303
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,759
think inch and a half by inch and a half

304
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,759
size very small can easily hook it up to

305
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,919
your rope ratchet hang it down canopy

306
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,000
level and it connects to my smartphone

307
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,319
so has its own dedicated app i can get

308
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,759
alerts if my temperature humidity is out

309
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,680
of range and that's what i've been using

310
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,078
for many many years i've used the pulse

311
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:12,639
monitor in the past larger

312
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:15,519
than the sensor push there's some more

313
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:18,078
features in there the newer ones you can

314
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,399
actually par it has a par meter attached

315
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:24,639
to it so that's another option ac

316
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:27,360
infiniti controller 69 wi-fi edition not

317
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:30,159
released yet i just got my hands on it

318
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,079
i'm about to start to use it but from my

319
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,559
understanding it'll be similar to the

320
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:36,639
sensor push where you can get alerts on

321
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,159
your smartphone i think you can do that

322
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,519
right now with the controller 69 correct

323
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,399
me if i'm wrong i haven't been using the

324
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,078
controller 69 just yet but i believe

325
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,600
it'll be set up the same and you'll be

326
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:49,599
able to do your ac infinity inline fan

327

337
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,959

338
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,399
patiently waiting for your book just

339
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,638
picked up the teaming series with

340
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,399
lowenfelds yeah well i i mean if you're

341
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,519
a beginner you'll get some value out of

342
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,278
it but

343
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,839
just to reiterate my book is just

344
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:24,159
specifically for beginners it takes you

345
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,440
everywhere from getting the equipment

346
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,879
seeds and going out through from seed

347
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,160
all the way through curing and then

348
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:31,679
there's a section in there for like the

349
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,199
top 12 plant problems and what you can

350
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,638
do about it it's written for the bare

351
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,040
bones beginners i've had some people

352
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,399
that bought it and they had experience

353
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,919
and they're kind of disappointed like

354
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,399
why is this such basic information i'm

355
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,159
like well it's a beginner book

356
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,360
so uh hopefully you're a beginner to

357
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,600
help you on that avenue if you do have

358
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,560
an experience just keep in mind it's a

359
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,920
book for beginners teaming series so uh

360
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,838
teaming with microbes is something that

361
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,360
i'm rereading right now and they

362
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,279
actually have an audio version of it so

363
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,360
the audio book i like listening to that

364
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:02,078
every now and then i consider that more

365
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,079
of an advanced book there's a lot of

366
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,719
good information in there but it gets

367
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:09,439
very deep into soul science so be

368
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,440
patient if you are a beginner

369
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,279
intermediate i mean geez you can even be

370
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,920
an advanced person and

371
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:17,439
get confused by some of the things or

372
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,599
some of the things may go over your head

373
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,120
but a lot of great information big shout

374
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,120
out to jeff lowenfeld maybe i can get

375
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,759

376
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:32,950
