1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
coming up on garden talk there's enough

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,160
calcium inside your tap water there's

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,839
enough of the basic nutrients you need

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,080
to sustain your seedling stage to

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,080
sustain early veg especially when you're

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,039
in that living soil or no-till soil

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,839
setup my grows are a lot better since i

8
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:20,160
went from a synthetic grow to organic

9
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:22,079
grow the chlorine debate on oh that's

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,439
killing organics i believe is a little

11
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,799
bit over the top i don't think it's

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,719
nearly something that we need to worry

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,199
about as much as what other things out

14
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,919
there and the only time you pretty much

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,239
need an ro filter right away is when

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,359
you're maybe making concentrates before

17
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:39,599
topping try to bend and if you can't

18
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,840
successfully bend the top lower than the

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,079
medium nodes then you might have to look

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,160
into topping i'm getting better color

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,759
now i'm getting better bud density now

22
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,199
and i'm getting better overall terpenes

23
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,199
than i've ever had before

24
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,599

community i was actually on his channel

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,680
a few weeks back and he asked me a whole

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,680
bunch of controversial questions on

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,600
highly debated topics in this episode i

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,280

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,719
samsung diodes are spaced out resulting

70
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,878
in a better light spread across the

71

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,880
based things right are talking from

123
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,000
experience neither of us are scientists

124
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:29,000
right

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
we're we're no experts in the field

126
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,198
whatever you want to call it

127
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,959

129
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,120

let us know what you think about some of

133
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,759
the things that we're talking about um

134
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,359
highly debatable topics and uh yeah

135
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,000
let's just let's just get into this one

136
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,319
so you ready i'm ready i'm ready but

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,680
first actually let's do introduction

138
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,519
tell us a little bit about yourself and

139
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,160
kind of how you got into gardening

140
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:03,038
all right all right my name is uh derek

141
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,240
i run a 24 7 community on twitch called

142
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,360
the bud lab

143
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,038
uh 24 7 as in literally we don't ever go

144
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,400
offline we've been live for over three

145
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,159
years straight

146
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,319
we're just a little community on twitch

147
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,360
and uh loving every day of it

148
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,360
i've been gardening

149
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,000
for over

150
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,119
four years now i would say

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,959
and

152
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,800
it's an adventure every single day

153
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,319
always learning and i can't wait to see

154
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,079
what the next four years are going to be

155
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,719
nice nice so what would you say your

156
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:36,319
overall style of gardening is i mean

157
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,720
indoor outdoor soil cocoa hydro organic

158
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,360
synthetic what's your style

159
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:46,240
uh my style i would say would be mainly

160
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,240
indoor uh i would say i'm like a blend

161
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,560
between each stage of growing i change

162
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,240
kind of what i do

163
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,000
so if i'm in uh more of the veg stage i

164
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,160
might be more of a synthetic grower if

165
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,560
i'm in the flowering stage i might be

166
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,880
more of an organic grower so i try to

167
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,800
almost base it per room so my flowering

168
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:08,319
room i would say would be in my eyes

169
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,199
would be 99.9 percent organic i do have

170
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,560
i do have some outdoor plants that i uh

171
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,360
uh i grow

172
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,639
once in a while uh more of uh like the

173
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,199
uh cutting flowers like uh dahlias i do

174
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,800
a couple of uh gardens for veggies but

175
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,840
not too too much

176
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,918
i i mostly focus on uh

177
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,478
the other plants so you do have

178
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,560
experience with both synthetics and

179
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,279
organics what are your thoughts on

180
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,038
organics having a better terpene profile

181
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,879
you think that's uh i think that's true

182
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,000
or do you think that it might might not

183
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,120
be true

184
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,759
um

185
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,478
coming off of personal experience i

186
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,479
would personally say my grows are a lot

187
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:49,758
better since i went from a synthetic

188
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,359
grow to

189
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,280
organic grow

190
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,360
i think my

191
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:59,279
my rosin is better i think my

192
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,360
my overall flower looks better i think

193
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,239
my colors of the flower looks better i

194
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,240
think it just overall looks better

195
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,000
i've never gone and actually got any of

196
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,519
my stuff tested for

197
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,279
the values of terpenes and stuff like

198
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,839
that i would love to and to get an

199
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,000
actual comparison side by side but

200
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,000
everything that i've done in my personal

201
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,959
experience i truly believe that organics

202
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,038
is the way how about mixing organics and

203
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,799
synthetic some people will will do that

204
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,478
throughout the grill you know they'll

205
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,120
start off with organics maybe like a

206
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,399
pre-mixed soil to begin

207
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,478
then maybe they'll top dress some

208
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,239
organics and maybe they'll you know when

209
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,959
they start seeing deficiencies or

210
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,439
whatever they'll add in some synthetics

211
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,959
you know that fast boosting totally

212
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,519
recovery

213
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,519
do you have any objections to mixing

214
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,038
organic or synthetics do you think it

215
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,878
should be done or it shouldn't be done

216
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,560
or anything like that

217
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,560
no i think it's uh if you know what

218
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,399
products you're using and you know that

219
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,399
there's not going to be any

220
00:07:54,399 --> 00:08:00,318
nutrient fallout or any nutrient

221
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,159
conflict or uh or maybe uh

222
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,800
killing off your microbes in your in

223
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,160
your living soil if you are confident in

224
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,360
the product that you're using or your

225
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,960
synthetic product that you're using

226
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,598
that's not gonna do that then yeah i'd

227
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,000
say it would be safe like uh

228
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:16,240
i i definitely use i have a synthetic

229
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,478
cow mag for if i do need it i definitely

230
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,079
have um

231
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,560
different products and kelps and stuff

232
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,439
like that that i will use if i need it

233
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,280
uh

234
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,038
a kelp liquid spray or something like

235
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,559
that which i wouldn't consider 100

236
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,560
organic when it's

237
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,360
mixed with something um

238
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,278
i

239
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,759
it's just really pick with the products

240
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,000
that you can find that aren't going to

241
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,158
cause a conflict with what you're doing

242
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,080
i've had some really good success doing

243
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,399
singanics i think that's a lot of people

244
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,920
call it organics mixing the two

245
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,240
um you know again starting out with the

246
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,919
pre-mixed soil and then adding synthetic

247
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,440
nutrients after the fact for the rest of

248
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,360
the grow you know particularly in flour

249
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,040
and stuff like that and uh

250
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,720
i've gotten some great results doing

251
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,599
that um i don't have anything against it

252
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,080
i don't think you're gonna have a a poor

253
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,680
final result in my opinion

254
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,399
yeah i know there's people who think

255
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,759
that

256
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,440
the first time they feed in those

257
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,799
synthetic nutrients they're wiping out

258
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,399
their microbial life that's in the

259
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:14,479
medium which is just you know not true

260
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,159
that's like the uh the chlorine debate

261
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,839
as well where people are like oh don't

262
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,120
use tap water for organics because that

263
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,320
little bit of chlorine is going to kill

264
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,720
your microbes and i'm like

265
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,160
i don't know about that i think we need

266
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,759
a little bit more than just what's in

267
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,759
our tap water

268
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,519
yep no you're right that's that's

269
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,919
another thing i'm glad you brought that

270
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,919
up chlorine chloramine that's often said

271
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,360
to kill off microbes so you don't think

272
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,599
that's the case huh

273
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,440
i i do think it does kill off microbes

274
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,959
but i think the amount that are in the

275
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,720
water like the amount that people are

276
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,719
worrying about i don't think is the

277
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,360
amount that we need to worry about like

278
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,800
if we are just using say like and there

279
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,360
is cheaper products out there like we

280
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,519
can use kdf filters rv filters we can do

281
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,080
two stage filters we you can let your

282
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,159
water sit for uh 12 hours to to

283
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,079
evaporate a lot of that stuff so i think

284
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,240
the chlorine debate on oh that's killing

285
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:05,599
organics i think is i believe is a

286
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,799
little bit over the top i don't think

287
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,879
it's nearly something that we need to

288
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,399
worry about as much as what other things

289
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,320
out there there are lots of people that

290
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,799
have their toes hooked up directly to

291
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,480
the gardens people are uh

292
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,559
you know even even your irrigation

293
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,440
systems watering your lawn

294
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,199
or plants around totally that's all has

295
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,600
chlorine in it so

296
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,680
um for for that to say that's completely

297
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,440
wiping out your micro population i think

298
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,799
i think that's false well we're also

299
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,760
drinking it as well right we drink

300
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:36,159
chlorine in our water we also have

301
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,159
beneficial bacteria and stuff in our

302
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,679
bodies so is it

303
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,039
humans and plants i don't want to say

304
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,879
they're the same but we do have to

305
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,559
follow similar lines of calcium is

306
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,480
obviously important stuff like that's

307
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,838
important right so that's a big debate

308
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,240
yeah if you're drinking water with

309
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,079
calcium in it i'm sorry calcium i'm

310
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,519
gonna drink water with chlorine in it

311
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,000
that you're you're wiping out the

312
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,078
microbes in your gut biome right

313
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,360
yeah and using chlorine and like septic

314
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:00,799
tanks you're not supposed to you're

315
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,600
supposed to be using pretty much the

316
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:06,159
same microbes we add into our pots and

317
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,079
into our our living soils we're pretty

318
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,838
much adding to our septic tanks to

319
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:12,958
create the same

320
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,959
bacteria in both senses to

321
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,518
remove the negative bacteria and only

322
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,639
have your positive yeah and then ro

323
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,159
water i don't know if you have

324
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,319
experience with that but you hear about

325
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,000
people drinking rl water and i actually

326
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,519
spent years drinking laura water and i

327
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,360
got so much crap in the comments section

328
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,480
when i said that because apparently

329
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,159
there are studies out there that's

330
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,240
saying that it it's

331
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,679
robbing nutrients from your body right

332
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,120
because it's like it doesn't have it's

333
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,278
not bound to anything it's just straight

334
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,879
h2o so when you're drinking it it's

335
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:40,720
binding to those nutrients and then you

336
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,958
you it's depleting from your body

337
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,800
depleting from your body exactly some

338
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,278
people say the same thing with plants

339
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:49,039
that you shouldn't be using ro water

340
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,919
into your medium because it's

341
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:56,000
potentially robbing the plant of

342
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:58,958
nutrients what do you think about that

343
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,200
anyone who watches me knows me and my uh

344
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,039
me and ro is a little bit of a touchy

345
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,040
subject because

346
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,639
i truly believe there's other methods

347
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,039
before getting an ro machine i think the

348
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,440
ro machines are the la ro filters are

349
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,838
the last thing we need and the only time

350
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,760
you pretty much need an ro filter right

351
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,760
away is when you're maybe making

352
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,159
concentrates but in growing there's so

353
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,559
many other things that we can use to

354
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,559
remove a lot of these things that ro

355
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,958
water they think is the number one thing

356
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,799
that we all need like people go out and

357
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,559
get ro machines because they don't want

358
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,479
calcium spots from the humidifiers

359
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,559
anymore but you can literally buy little

360
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,480
tablets that go inside your humidifier

361
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,799
that remove that calcium

362
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,320
and it's just called a demineralizer i

363
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,759
think they're called um you can buy

364
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,278
those so you don't really need to put ro

365
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,958
inside your humidifier you can buy those

366
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:48,720
a lot cheaper ro water wastes more water

367
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,518
and most of the time it wastes more

368
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,639
water than usable water so in places

369
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,639
where water is very limited or or or

370
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,720
water is very valuable which it really

371
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,039
is you're draining you're throwing it

372
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,720
all down the drain so i think there's a

373
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,360
lot of options out there that we should

374
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,879
be looking at before we look at ro and

375
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,919
there's actually a good documentary

376
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,600
online uh about the drinking of mineral

377
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:12,879
water and it's that and they're like

378
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,120
what you were saying they're saying that

379
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,759
it is healthier for you to drink

380
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:22,159
higher like uh ppm

381
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:23,679
water your higher ec higher tds to um

382
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,439
give you these minerals and stuff in

383
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,799
your body and it is not safe like what

384
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,560
you said and i shouldn't say not safe

385
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,078
but it is not it isn't recommended to

386
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,000
drink ro water because like exactly you

387
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:32,799
said it is pulling away from you

388
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,200
and

389
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,199
i've said that with growing before i've

390
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,759
said that that i think if you are using

391
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,959
ro water to

392
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:44,480
to water seedlings or for your veg or to

393
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:48,239
do this and that

394
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,839
most tap water is all right unless yeah

395
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,278
okay you're in a well or you're in a

396
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,560
place where the tap water is not even

397
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:54,000
safe to drink

398
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,518
and then if you're at a point where it's

399
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,120
not even safe to drink then yeah it's

400
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,198
probably not safe for your plants but if

401
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,120
it's within that 200

402
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:04,799
maybe up to that 300 ppm

403
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,639
my opinion it seems to be pretty safe

404
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,240
for going through veg going through

405
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,240
seedling stage and going through my

406
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,000
flower at least in my setup so i wasn't

407
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,159
aware of the tablets that you mentioned

408
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,440
i'll have to look those up uh that

409
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,639
that's pretty cool i didn't even realize

410
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,519
they had those so i do run ro

411
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,759
okay cringe for you probably hey it's

412
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,440
not it's not cringe if you reuse the

413
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,198
waste water hook it up to your toilet

414
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,360
put it inside a reservoir and maybe use

415
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,120
it outside or something right

416
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,959
exactly what i was just about to say is

417
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,720
that doggo the hutt he was on one of our

418
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,559
podcast episodes before he had mentioned

419
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,199
that his drain line right that line

420
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,039
that's the wasted water is going to

421
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,120
he's put into a bucket and then using it

422
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,519
on his plants outdoors

423
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,600
exactly so it's being used right you're

424
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,919
not wasting that water but yeah what is

425
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,600
it for every gallon it's draining three

426
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,958
gallons or something like that it's it's

427
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,639
kind of crazy

428
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,479
it's from one to one all the way up to

429
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,240
one to five so it's depending on what

430
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,159
your base water going in and what you

431
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,799
want coming out and a lot of people are

432
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,399
chasing for that zero and you can get uh

433
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,759
you can get a one to one and come out

434
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,278
with like a 10

435
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,519
like a rather than a z or come out with

436
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:12,480
like a 10 ppm which in my opinion is

437
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:15,198
even better because you can't use ph

438
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,920
pens in our water it breaks your ph bin

439
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:19,919
and so many people

440
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:23,360
do it and and then they come back why is

441
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:25,278
my blue labs ph pen all uncalibrated and

442
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,278
you're like it's because the ro water

443
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,198
and it says right in the manual cannot

444
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:30,720
be used in ro water so they always

445
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:33,039
recommend put a little bit of calmag in

446
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,040
your arrow water before using the ph but

447
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,799
if you already start with like a 10

448
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,599
not the zero you have a little bit of

449
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:43,120
minerals in there for the ion exchange

450
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,278
in your uh your ph meter and it works it

451
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,639
doesn't cause any problems mostly zro

452
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,278
systems aren't actually stripping it

453
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,799
down to zero ppm anyways like mine i

454
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:52,240
think is uh

455
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:56,319
you know i've had some that went down to

456
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,320
20 ppm 40 ppm i think 8 ppm is what i

457
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,160
measured recently okay so

458
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,680
i do have the ability to i know exactly

459
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:04,240
what you mean though right it's like

460
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,519
even with uh ppm meters

461
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,320
it you're it's not going to read it

462
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,759
properly right exactly exactly exactly

463
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,320
so i have a starting base water of 150

464
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,079
and at 150 i think it is perfect like

465
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,560
seedling stage at 150 you don't need to

466
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,078
add any nutrients to it because you have

467
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,919
there's enough calcium inside your tap

468
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,919
water there's enough of the basic

469
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:26,159
nutrients you need to sustain your

470
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,759
seedling stage to sustain early veg

471
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,240
especially when you're in that living

472
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,320
soil or no-till soil setup you can be

473
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,720
feeding no no nutrients and just living

474
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,278
off that living soil for for months

475
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,759
weeks just by using tap water i wish i

476
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:42,639
had that low of ppm my ppm on my tap

477
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:45,360
water comes out at 485 i think that's

478
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,278
the 500 i think it's the last

479
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,800
limit at least here for safe drinking

480
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:53,120
water same with the state yeah okay so

481
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,479
i'm right right on the edge there yeah

482
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,000
yeah you're right on the edge maybe

483
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,360
that's why you got an our own machine

484
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,879
right

485
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,680
but i can always and i haven't done this

486
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:04,400
yet is send out this a water sample to

487
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,399
get a water sample and then i can

488
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,038
actually see what's in the water

489
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,360
and then actually you can formulate

490
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:12,078
nutrients around that right so we talked

491
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,678
about

492
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,438
potentially

493
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,519
you know having a lot of calcium in the

494
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,439
tap water already magnesium or whatever

495
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,318
else is in there well then we need to

496
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,240
use as much calmag for example exactly

497
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,318
100 100

498
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,798
and i think people who are using like in

499
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,240
my opinion if you are using a media

500
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,400
where it is

501
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,960
you you have to add more calcium like

502
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,640
cocoa for an example tap water is

503
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,319
actually a savior almost because you're

504
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,679
not having to add all that calcium

505
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,798
because you're already giving it you

506
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,679
don't have to worry about it i know with

507
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:43,119
cocoa

508
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,320
you might have to still add more but

509
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:45,918
you're not

510
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,359
you're not starting with a zero you're

511
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,520
starting with a little bit of a base so

512
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,519
it's like okay am i way off am i not

513
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,519
like i like it i'm a big fan of tap

514
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:54,879
water i'm i'm a fan of ro water but i

515
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,679
think you need to be

516
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,600
uh

517
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,519
respectful of the ro water and you need

518
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,959
to figure out what you're gonna what are

519
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,160
you using it for using only for

520
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,558
humidifiers because there's other

521
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,160
options are you using it for a array of

522
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:07,279
things well then yeah obviously it makes

523
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,679
sense

524
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,918
that's a good way to put it

525
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,480
um do you have experience growing

526
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,038
autoflowers at all uh yeah type r in

527
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,960
chat um

528
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,339
i i

529
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,380
i understand without it now

530
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:25,379
[Laughter]

531
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,360
i don't know what you're talking about

532
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,440
uh anytime uh

533
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:35,359
anytime we talk about an autoflower i

534
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,160
yell type r in chat

535
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:41,678
um and type r is just uh i don't know if

536
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,320
i'm saying this right but ruder alice

537
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,840
alice which is your uh which is your uh

538
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:48,480
your ditch plant

539
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,918
or quote unquote ditch and uh that's why

540
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,000
we say type r so anytime we say

541
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:56,000
autoflower type r and chat

542
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,119
so comments type r in chat

543
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
but uh

544
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:02,079
i have grown a couple auto flowers um

545
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,119
light cycle how about that what do you

546
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,359
what do you think about the light cycle

547
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,199
for some people all right um

548
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,199
are saying that you shouldn't uh you

549
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,759
should give a period of darkness for the

550
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,080
autoflower yeah okay all right

551
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:17,038
i believe i truly believe that every

552
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:19,599
plant needs to have a sleeping cycle

553
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,919
just because an autoflower doesn't grow

554
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:24,558
by a time schedule or a light schedule

555
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,080
story it it's still it still has its

556
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,960
sleeping times it still has its time

557
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,119
where you can you can watch the plant

558
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,120
that at 18 hours you can start seeing

559
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,678
those leaves start to droop down again

560
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,119
and at that point in my opinion that's

561
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,759
when i will turn the lights off it's

562
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,759
already reached its dli for that day and

563
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,759
we're able to it's able to sustain

564
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,319
itself you don't need to run it for the

565
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:49,119
24. i think the extra six or the extra

566
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,879
four hours between that 20 or 24 hour i

567
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,879
think is just money coming out of your

568
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,280
pocket and it's not really giving you

569
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,559
the bonus you're really looking for

570
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:01,519
in in my opinion uh i think uh the best

571
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:04,960
light cycle for autoflowers is 18.6 i've

572
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:07,359
run them on 12 12 and i personally think

573
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,640
i you do get a um

574
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:12,558
you get a decrease in yield and quality

575
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,159
um if you're not

576
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,759
giving it the appropriate amount of

577
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,240
light so

578
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,640
if if you're giving if you have an under

579
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,400
if you have an underpowered led

580
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,400
it's probably better for you to go with

581
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,320
an autoflower in 18 hours a day because

582
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,559
you can reach your dli and you can get

583
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,720
dense buds if you're growing photo

584
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:33,200
periods and you don't have the best

585
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,960
light it's hard to get your full dli in

586
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,600
the 12 hour time period just like an

587
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,600
autoflower so it's easier in a more

588
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,918
budget-friendly setup to get that with

589
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,319
the autoflower i'm not saying autoflower

590
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,600
is the next best thing i think it's it's

591
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,519
a place where

592
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,678
we can finally

593
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,440
kind of regulate everything a little bit

594
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,960
i think we can finally

595
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,558
stabilize things a little bit and we've

596
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,640
seen that over the last couple years

597
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,599
with autoflowers that it has stabilized

598
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,880
a lot

599
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:00,719
but

600
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,280
yeah i i truly back to the light

601
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,960
question i truly think that 186 is the

602
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,558
is the light cycle for autoflowers i

603
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,240
don't think it should be changed

604
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,279
what if you in my opinion

605
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,839
reduce

606
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:15,519
the light to extend so the dli is

607
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:18,000
achieved at the 24 hour mark

608
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:20,158
so you're lowering your overall

609
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,519
yeah so you still still get dli within

610
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:26,080
within the 24 hours instead of 18 hours

611
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,079
yeah okay so if you're doing it that way

612
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,558
then then it's all in my opinion now

613
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:32,319
it's all about light coverage so now you

614
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,879
have to focus because right now to get

615
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:36,960
it to low enough par or low enough

616
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,240
wattage and par which usually equals

617
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,960
very similar when you're looking at

618
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,319
light numbers um if you're trying to get

619
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,919
very similar numbers to give you that

620
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,359
dli for the whole thing you're either

621
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,759
going to have to use a low wattage light

622
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,240
with high lots of coverage so you're

623
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,720
still getting those dense plants over it

624
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,720
because at for an example if you're in a

625
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,480
2x410 and you've got a 100 watt light

626
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,000
that 100 watt light

627
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,599
the normal hot 100 watt lights are

628
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,880
little tiny cubies right they're more of

629
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,719
a square

630
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,799
it's not filling out that whole 2x4 so

631
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,400
even if you have 24 hours of light you

632
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,960
might not be getting the full coverage

633
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,640
of the of the whole plant only maybe one

634
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,960
branch of that plant might be getting

635
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,400
its perfect par or dli for the whole day

636
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,600
so when you start getting down to

637
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,880
lowering your wattage to increase your

638
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,480
lights time on to give you the same par

639
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,200
you're now looking at

640
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,440
getting a larger light to be able to

641
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,120
cover that whole area to be able to grow

642
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,080
your plants closer to be able to get

643
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,158
that par

644
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,439
in that same 24 hours it's a lot harder

645
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,919
i think it's just easier just to go down

646
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,919
to 18.

647
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,519
okay all right

648
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,519
how about transplanting autos are you

649
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,038
for that or against it some people swear

650
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,918
and say you should never transplant

651
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:49,200
autos some people say no it's fine i'm

652
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:52,159
for it if you if you transplant smart so

653
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,440
if you let your if you let the seedling

654
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,679
or the plant

655
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,440
fill out the first pot before a

656
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,679
transplant is set and i'm not saying

657
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,519
make sure it's root bound i'm saying

658
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,759
make sure that when you do remove it

659
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,200
from the pot you're not going like this

660
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,038
and then the whole entire soil plug is

661
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,558
just falling apart and just dusting out

662
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,519
right you want to make sure that you can

663
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:14,079
pull out the the plant and it's holding

664
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,240
the media to it itself so that when you

665
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,240
transplant into the new pot using your

666
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,919
mycorrhizae using all that

667
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,839
you're forcing the roots to spread out

668
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,520
into the new soil and i think that is

669
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:25,119
perfectly fine but i think if you're or

670
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,639
early transplanting or you're late

671
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,399
transplanting then you're going to have

672
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,960
a problem 100

673
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,280
okay and then topping autoflowers is

674
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,880
another hot topic is

675
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:37,599
some people say you shouldn't do any

676
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,200
type of high stress training so topping

677
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,038
you know cutting off the top of a plant

678
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,840
for example so it creates two branches

679
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:45,599
coming out instead of just that one

680
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,079
are you for or against topping

681
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:50,480
autoflowers personally i think with

682
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,918
topping it's really based on genetics

683
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,519
you need to have it doesn't matter if

684
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,278
it's autoflower or photo i think it's

685
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,639
extremely important for genetics like

686
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:57,919
some plants you top and they're not

687
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,759
going to give you what you want the next

688
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,600
two nodes below don't stretch like you

689
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,119
want and that one that you just topped

690
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,918
off would have been better to bend it

691
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:09,918
right so i always try i always try to

692
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:12,159
say that before topping try to bend and

693
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,159
if you can't successfully bend the top

694
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,159
lower than the lowest or the medium

695
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,278
nodes then you might have to look into

696
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,200
topping i always suggest with topping to

697
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:22,640
clone that top but obviously with

698
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,319
autoflowers

699
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,240
you don't really have the

700
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,119
way to clone it's more of a monster crop

701
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,120
so

702
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,479
you are realistically just cutting that

703
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,759
off and you're either wasting it it's

704
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,240
going in the garbage or you are bending

705
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:39,440
it down to try and achieve that larger

706
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,480
cola in other places not just the top

707
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,480
right rather than growing like a

708
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,079
christmas tree bend it down allow that

709
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,519
main color to grow over here and allow

710
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:46,558
all these other spurts to shoot up here

711
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:47,679
right

712
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,079
gotcha

713
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,320
cloning autoflowers let's dig a little

714
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:53,519
deeper into that there's actually a guy

715
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:57,119
i don't know if you've ever heard of

716
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:59,119
them bill ward do you know who he is

717
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,199
i have heard of him yeah okay so

718
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,278
apparently he's been cloning autoflowers

719
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,960
and he's been getting like four plus

720
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:07,038
ounces per plant what are your thoughts

721
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,880
on that is it

722
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,720
is it cloning okay so

723
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,400
i've looked into i i haven't looked into

724
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,079
the whole method but i have heard of

725
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,080
people successfully cloning autoflowers

726
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,158
but what i've heard they're doing is

727
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:21,119
they're reverting the autoflower back to

728
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,720
a photo period trait before cloning it

729
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,079
so i don't know if it's a if it's

730
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,759
essentially cloning an autoflower i

731
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:26,960
don't know how he does it but what they

732
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:29,119
i've heard they've done is they've

733
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,720
stressed out an autoflower or they've

734
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,479
grown out an autoflower and they've gone

735
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,000
through or tried to go through a reveg

736
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,079
and it can stress it out so much that it

737
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,519
almost brings the photo traits back out

738
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:39,439
and what we've called them and what a

739
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,119
couple breeders have called them is

740
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,880
called they've called them

741
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,599
super autos where they might they might

742
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,600
start to veg seven eight weeks

743
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,719
and it's more or less like and i've seen

744
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:50,000
them like i've got a couple breeders

745
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,278
that i've worked that i've talked with

746
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,880
that are trying to grow these super

747
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:56,000
autos where they veg out for like eight

748
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,600
nine weeks become a huge autoflower and

749
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,119
they kind of grow like more like a photo

750
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:02,319
period but they have the autoflower

751
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:05,359
traits i don't know

752
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:07,439
how the whole autoflower cloning works i

753
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,038
think it's more of a reveg scenario or

754
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,120
maybe like

755
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,119
stressing it to bring out another trait

756
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:14,479
because i have seen other guys on

757
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:15,918
youtube

758
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,200
say they've successfully translated

759
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,799
autoflowers but it always seems like

760
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,480
there's a reveg involved and when

761
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:22,240
there's a reveg involved it usually

762
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,000
means it's gone back some type of traits

763
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,200
in my opinion i'm not a breeder i don't

764
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,558
know too much about that but from

765
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,600
everything that i've kind of learned

766
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:29,839
through

767
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,839
being in this seat is that's kind of

768
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,439
what i've seen that if you if you clone

769
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:34,720
an autoflower it's more of a monster

770
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,080
crop so it's

771
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,240
kind of like you're cutting all these

772
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,319
branches off cloning them out more or

773
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,839
less doing a see a green style and

774
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,319
hoping for the best

775
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:46,720
or you're reverting that original plant

776
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:48,558
back to like its photo style if you can

777
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,798
through back breeding or brac crossing

778
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:52,639
or however that all works and trying to

779
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,240
reclone it through that method i think

780
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,840
of the two that are going on again i

781
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,919
could have butchered that but that's how

782
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:59,918
i understand it

783
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,080
gotcha yeah i haven't watched bill's

784
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,240
videos but it was like a recent garden

785
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,558
talk podcast episode with somebody

786
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,720
mentioning that they mentioned that it's

787
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,319
pointless to clone autos because once

788
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,919
you clone it

789
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,918
it's going to start to flower still in

790
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,360
the same time cycle so you're really not

791
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,200
going to get much of a harvest so you

792
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:18,639
can actually clone it it'll root but you

793
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,480
won't get much of a harvest and then the

794
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,960
comment section was just flooded with

795
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,440
people mentioning uh bill ward and what

796
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,038
he's doing over there so i have to go

797
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,278
over there still and check it out i

798
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:30,720
would love to learn more about it and

799
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:32,720
learn more about the whole breeding side

800
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,558
of it because i do think that

801
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,079
we haven't even touched base on a lot of

802
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,480
that stuff i think like there's going to

803
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:41,038
be other ways of doing breeding and

804
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,120
other ways of maybe maybe hate using

805
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,640
this term manipulating or mutating the

806
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,199
plants in different methods to maybe

807
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,960
come out with another freak show or

808
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,960
whatever right like you don't know we

809
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,679
like i saw your last videos up it's

810
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,679
looking awesome

811
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:58,479
yeah it'll be interesting to see if

812
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:00,158
more traits like that can be brought out

813
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,919
in the future doing different various

814
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,760
techniques

815
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,559
yeah talking now talking beyond

816
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:09,679
autoflowers leaf stripping

817
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:11,440
so defoliation some people call it

818
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,278
some people swear that you shouldn't

819
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,558
leave strip at all in flower in

820
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,960
particular

821
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:18,639
so i think a lot of people do agree that

822
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,880
some sort of leaf stripping or some

823
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,840
people consider it lollipopping where

824
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,399
you're removing the lower third or lower

825
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:28,558
quarter of crotch so the bud develop can

826
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,479
focus on the top part of the plant

827
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,200
doing defoliation

828
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,120
to remove leaves so liking penetrate

829
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,640
down into the canopy what's your

830
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,639
thoughts on that and then also going

831
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,720
into flower there are people who are

832
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,120
adamant that you should be

833
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,720
leaf stripping in flower

834
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,158
during some of the prime weeks of bud

835
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,440
production

836
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,520
and it actually helps with bud

837
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,240
production so i do

838
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,960
a leaf stripping trimming from day one

839
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,599
of flower all the way until day 21.

840
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,600
i might push it until day 25 day 26

841
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:01,038
whatever i

842
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,359
pretty much try to schedule it and where

843
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,759
i can schedule it with my life right i i

844
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,759
do think the beginning of flower

845
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,240
i believe it's important it's very

846
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:12,798
important to uh trim and to get rid of

847
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,798
those lowers because most of us aren't

848
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,720
focusing on

849
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:19,119
light penetration and pushing the light

850
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,720
as low as possible spreading out our

851
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:22,879
plants as much as possible a lot of us

852
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,240
are focusing on trying to get the best

853
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,520
yield and the best

854
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:31,038
best uh quantity so they're not focusing

855
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:33,679
on the into the the inside branches and

856
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:36,480
all of this so how how i always have

857
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:40,640
done it and how i try to push and try to

858
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:43,360
uh show uh my stream is from day one all

859
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,520
the way until day 21 i pretty much do

860
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,798
every other day i'm taking a handful of

861
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:48,000
leaves off and i'm like what you said

862
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,158
lollipopping i'm starting from the

863
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,519
bottom moving my way all the way up so

864
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:56,399
by by day 21 i pretty much have

865
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,679
a fully lollipop plant or all of my

866
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:59,839
plants are fully lollipopped and

867
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,559
everything that's below either the your

868
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:04,558
net or everything that's below the the

869
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,798
the farthest your light can travel has

870
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:08,639
been removed because your leaves are

871
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,278
your solar panels if they're not getting

872
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,038
any light they're not doing anything

873
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,759
they're just sitting there so they're

874
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:18,960
just a home for bugs they're a home for

875
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:20,798
for uh the bottom canopy um

876
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,880
the bottom canopy icky stuff that you

877
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:27,839
don't want and uh

878
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,240
i have been trying out different train

879
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,240
uh trimming methods of trimming from day

880
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,480
one all the way to day 21 and then not

881
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,880
doing anything until day

882
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,480
42 in flower like what you mentioned an

883
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,039
uh

884
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,240
end of flower cycle trim to try and

885
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,640
either

886
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,000
open up the the remaining bud sites that

887
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,759
are kind of a little bit lower on

888
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,798
everything that's now grown out and

889
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,200
everything because everything's now just

890
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,558
exploded so now you're trying to open up

891
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,640
some of these lower bud sites for the

892
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:56,558
last two three weeks right because you

893
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,080
don't want that

894
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:59,519
butt in the middle that's all squished

895
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:00,558
together and all

896
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,079
or that flour in the middle you don't

897
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:03,599
want any of that because it's just not

898
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:05,839
what you're looking for or it's not what

899
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:07,439
i'm looking for so i just remove it you

900
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:11,839
talked about taking off handfuls of

901
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,000
leaves from day 21 to 21 each day

902
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,439
you often hear that every two days every

903
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,200
two days okay

904
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,360
i often hear about people saying that if

905
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,759
you're doing too much training too much

906
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:23,839
defoliation it could stress out the plan

907
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,798
to the point it becomes a hermaphrodite

908
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,398
have you come across that at all or do

909
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:31,599
you not believe in that

910
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:33,918
um i've i i do believe in that i i

911
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:36,000
believe that again it's i think it's

912
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,440
it's based on genetics so if you are

913
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,599
growing

914
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,038
uh a bag seed if you are growing

915
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,639
something that you don't really know

916
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:44,158
where it's coming from

917
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,000
yeah you might want to worry about it

918
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,480
but if you're growing uh something that

919
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,720
you have grown for a while now that you

920
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,120
know it's stable that you know you can

921
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,519
push it a little bit i don't i i i don't

922
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:59,359
really see anything wrong with it i the

923
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:01,839
only herme i've ever had is when i ran a

924
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,519
green light beside uh um one of my

925
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:05,839
cameras in the uh the flower room i've

926
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,599
i've tested ir lights i've tested a ton

927
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:11,599
of different things the only herme i've

928
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:12,798
ever had was from that green light

929
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,480
so

930
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:16,558
the trimming i think maybe the biggest

931
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,399
negative to over trimming and leaving a

932
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:20,960
lot of trimming up a lot of the bottoms

933
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:23,359
was would be that if your plants aren't

934
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,038
as healthy as they could be or can be

935
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,798
and your room's not as clean as it

936
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:28,960
should be it's definitely more

937
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:32,480
susceptible to bringing in things into

938
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,919
the plant like uh if you have

939
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,679
um

940
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,120
molds or if you have bacterias or

941
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,960
something in your garden you're cutting

942
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:41,119
up all these plants you're leaving an

943
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,720
exposed

944
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,959
source for these things to travel right

945
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,798
into your plant right like bud rod all

946
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,079
these different things can happen if

947
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,599
you're over cutting and that's why they

948
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:51,359
try to tell you not to trim outdoor

949
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,119
plants very much right because the more

950
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:54,639
cuts that you have and on these outdoor

951
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,879
the more things that things can get into

952
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,320
that plant right that makes sense you

953
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,640
talked about green light i want to

954
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,000
circle back to that because uh you know

955
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,000
they sell those green head lamps and

956
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,440
they're like oh well going to grow just

957
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
turn on the green light

958
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,840
fine plants not gonna have any issues

959
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,519
with that whatsoever

960
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,278
you found the opposite you said you

961
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,200
actually had plans to turn hermaphrodite

962
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:17,599
from the green light right yeah it was

963
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,440
actually crazy because what i did is i

964
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:22,639
wanted to display

965
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,960
uh the trichomes forming on a plant in

966
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,240
real time for people so on my livestream

967
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,720
i put a camera right up to to it and i

968
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,640
put a green light right above it and the

969
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,120
green light is because the camera i was

970
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,440
using didn't have any ir for night i

971
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:39,518
used the green light at it was it was it

972
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,840
was a one watt

973
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,839
smart led and i had it dimmed to two

974
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:46,558
percent you couldn't even really see the

975
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:48,879
green on it it was so low the only thing

976
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:51,678
that could see it was the camera

977
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,600
and only one branch on the whole entire

978
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,200
plant hermeed and it was the branch that

979
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:56,959
i was trying to macro

980
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,640
it was the only one and it's this strain

981
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,079
i've nice continue to grow today i've

982
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,799
cloned off of that one it hasn't

983
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:04,798
rehearmed i have it's one of my best

984
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:07,200
plants and i've never had any problems

985
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,559
with it now and the only thing i can say

986
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,639
that it was from was from that green

987
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:12,078
light i have seen the green lights that

988
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,440
people put on their headlamps or on

989
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,519
their head and they go in their garden

990
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,200
this and that i think they work if

991
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:19,358
you're going in there for like five

992
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:21,759
minutes 10 minutes but then at that

993
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,440
point is five minutes of light on or if

994
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,119
you opening the door for five minutes

995
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,280
and taking a couple pictures really

996
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,559
doing harm then to get that green light

997
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,079
and go in there and make sure that your

998
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,759
inspector gadget with the green light i

999
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,839
don't know about that that's super

1000
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,480
interesting good little experiment that

1001
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:39,039
you you chose to do and

1002
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,039
that was a result you got from it so

1003
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:43,039
interesting to you that was

1004
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,800
if you look at the very beginning of my

1005
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,639
stream three years ago all of the

1006
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,879
nighttime photos and nighttime footage

1007
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,960
was all green now it's all gray because

1008
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,398
i've upgraded to ir because ir doesn't

1009
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,240
cause certain

1010
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:56,960
wavelengths of ir doesn't cause any

1011
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,959
problems so the wavelength of ir in

1012
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,920
security cameras or most security

1013
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,559
cameras i should say is good for uh

1014
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,960
plants and i wouldn't say all plants

1015
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,559
because i have tested my greenhouse and

1016
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,480
i've tested some of the outdoor cutting

1017
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,239
flowers and i have noticed that some of

1018
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,079
them that are near the ir at night are

1019
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,078
growing four times bigger than the ones

1020
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,320
that aren't growing near the ir at night

1021
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,119
but it doesn't seem to have any effect

1022
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,920
on uh on my indoor it only has effect on

1023
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,079
like the um gla i think we noticed it

1024
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,680
with the gladiolus's last year which is

1025
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,599
a very beautiful

1026
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:33,279
cutting flower kind of looks like uh uh

1027
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,359
kind of like a christmas tree

1028
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,440
very very very tall like a lupine almost

1029
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:39,679
if anyone knows what a loop okay

1030
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,838
so yeah spectrum manipulation that was

1031
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:44,000
on the list here

1032
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:45,519
anything else in regards to spectrum

1033
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,679
that you think are maybe

1034
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:49,199
controversial that uh that we missed

1035
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:52,078
there i mean we touched upon ir and

1036
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:54,960
green light a little bit anything else

1037
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,440
uv uv stuff

1038
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,199
yeah uv uh we're looking into a little

1039
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,599
bit of uv trying i'm trying to learn a

1040
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:03,358
little bit of it it right now or two

1041
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,519
years ago all these led light companies

1042
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:08,400
were coming out with these uv diodes on

1043
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:10,239
there on their uh on their hlgs or on

1044
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,358
their samsungs or whatever the heck uh

1045
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,639
lights people are using they're trying

1046
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:16,799
to sell this uv led uv led

1047
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:20,879
and all of the research that i could do

1048
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:24,079
on is that these uv leds were at a third

1049
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,880
or an eighth of the life span

1050
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,280
of your full spectrum uh diode so you're

1051
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,039
buying this led that

1052
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,880
these uvs are only going to work for

1053
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,320
maybe one or two grows and then they're

1054
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,000
gonna die out but then you have this

1055
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,960
light that now you're supposed to have

1056
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,280
uv but it doesn't have uv so i think two

1057
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,679
years ago they started changing into uh

1058
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,400
different bulb style lights because they

1059
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,559
started realizing uv a and uvb work

1060
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,880
better in bulbs rather than leds they

1061
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:52,559
seem to not have the technology for led

1062
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,559
we are coming out with it definitely

1063
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:57,358
coming out with it but for growing right

1064
00:36:54,559 --> 00:37:00,480
now it seems like the best uvbs you can

1065
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:03,119
get are in still fluorescent bulb styles

1066
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,000
they're the ones that seem the best um

1067
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,838
people are now testing uvb and flower

1068
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,880
cycles to try and increase the terpene

1069
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:13,759
percentages for concentrates or and try

1070
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,680
and increase the overall trichome resin

1071
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,480
percentage so they can get more return

1072
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:22,000
on their concentrates um people are

1073
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,119
trying uh it with like turning on uvb uh

1074
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,760
or uv light uh two hours a day in mid

1075
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,160
mid flower cycle or turning it on at two

1076
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,599
hours at the end of your flower cycle or

1077
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:33,598
turning off all your flower lights and

1078
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,800
then turning the uv on just for an hour

1079
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,119
and then turning back on your flower

1080
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,320
lights similar to how people are using

1081
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,559
ir 15 minutes before turning lights on

1082
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,400
in 15 minutes after turning lights off

1083
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:47,358
to try and send your plant to sleep

1084
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,559
faster and to wake up your plant faster

1085
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:50,719
people are testing all these different

1086
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:52,559
theories of different wavelengths and

1087
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:54,319
this and that

1088
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,639
i think it's all trying to manipulate

1089
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,640
the sun as best as we can or try and

1090
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:00,960
figure out what we can do better than

1091
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:04,400
the sun the plant grows awesome

1092
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,760
um uh in under the sun

1093
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,119
but

1094
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,960
it

1095
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,720
what can we make what can we do what

1096
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,720
spectrum can we add what wavelength can

1097
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:14,959
we add what can we do extra that can

1098
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,639
make it even better yeah i mean you said

1099
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,039
it pretty well there the sun is kind of

1100
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:21,358
limited to that one spectrum right it's

1101
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:23,199
like we have the ability to change the

1102
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:25,358
spectrum and change the morphology of

1103
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:27,118
the plants so there's still a ton of

1104
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:28,159
studies going on in regards to this i'm

1105
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,119
sure this is something that's going to

1106
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,960
be happening for the next five ten plus

1107
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,519
years seeing what the what the spectrum

1108
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,358
does for the morphology of the plant so

1109
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:39,119
i'm excited to see what what outcomes in

1110
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:41,440
the future you know

1111
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,160
well it was crazy too because

1112
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,960
four years ago three years ago every it

1113
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:46,879
was

1114
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,559
if you wanted uh if you wanted a flower

1115
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,680
dedicated light you were getting a light

1116
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,719
that was around 3000 kelvins right

1117
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:55,440
um uh

1118
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:57,118
which is your would you more of a a red

1119
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,200
spectrum right more on the red more on

1120
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,480
that yellowy red spectrum not so much

1121
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,519
blue right

1122
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,760
and then you would use the blue

1123
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:05,599
spectrums for your veg right but now

1124
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,040
we're starting to realize that that's

1125
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,519
not really what it's what we're trying

1126
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:11,039
to do anymore is you see a lot of these

1127
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,800
flower lights that are coming out now

1128
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:17,519
that are at 4 45 4 500 kelvins or

1129
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,680
they're at 5 000 kelvins trying to push

1130
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,400
as much blue light as possible on those

1131
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:24,319
flower and they're offsetting it with ir

1132
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,480
in red now so they're saying okay let's

1133
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,320
maximize the blue spectrum as much as

1134
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,280
possible because we know blue is counts

1135
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,640
for

1136
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,960
leaf growth

1137
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,319
the the node spacing this and that right

1138
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,280
and then now let's

1139
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,440
throw it with some ir ir does very

1140
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,200
similar to blue but now on the red

1141
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,559
spectrum right and it can also create

1142
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:46,960
bud density and now we are now because

1143
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:48,320
now we have ir and now we have blue now

1144
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,920
we're getting way too much we're almost

1145
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,000
getting too much stretch it's not it's

1146
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,000
almost an offset now so now we add a

1147
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,760
little bit of red just to create that

1148
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,440
perfect balance and like with the lights

1149
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,160
that i use in flower they're 30 no

1150
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,519
they're 5300 kelvins

1151
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:03,039
four years ago people be like why are

1152
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:04,400
you why are you flowering with veg

1153
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:06,480
lights and i'm like no i'm getting

1154
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,760
better color now i'm getting better bud

1155
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,599
density now and i'm getting better

1156
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,040
overall terpenes than i've ever had

1157
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,960
before

1158
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:16,559
it's crazy to see that shift

1159
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,559
yeah it's really crazy

1160
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,000
let's flip it up let's talk about

1161
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:22,838
flushing

1162
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,440
hot topic this was uh actually all

1163
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:27,920
right i actually went on my instagram

1164
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,920
and i did a story and asking people for

1165
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,760
these controversial topics for this

1166
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,519
particular talk so shout out to those

1167
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,560
folks that mentioned flushing as one of

1168
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:38,318
them that was on my initial list but

1169
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:41,440
there was a ton of people that want to

1170
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:42,559
know your thoughts on flushing so what

1171
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,200
do you think about flushing what's your

1172
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:45,199
thoughts on all right

1173
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,440
okay so

1174
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,838
the term flushing is

1175
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,240
thrown

1176
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:56,239
around with way too many definitions and

1177
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:57,679
i think some of the definitions that are

1178
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,318
being thrown around

1179
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:02,960
are a little bit out of out of the

1180
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:05,279
ballpark and some of them are makes

1181
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,199
sense some of them make perfect sense so

1182
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,240
when i think when i think of the term

1183
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,919
flushing i immediately think of

1184
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:13,759
revival almost

1185
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,559
any time i need to flush something it

1186
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,240
means my plant is in an oopsie state and

1187
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,000
i need to fix it

1188
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:23,199
it's the way i look at flushing so i am

1189
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,318
trying to remove a buildup in the soil

1190
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:28,480
so that my plant isn't uptaking that

1191
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:29,279
over abundance of nutrients that's in

1192
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,079
there

1193
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,119
so i'm not removing the nutrients from

1194
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,680
the plant physically i am allowing the

1195
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,838
plant to eat what's already being uptake

1196
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,000
what's already inside its system and i'm

1197
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:43,920
removing it from the soil because the

1198
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,358
way i look at it is that your soil life

1199
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,440
is the most important thing in my grow

1200
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:49,598
is that if my soil is healthy my plants

1201
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,200
are healthy

1202
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,640
there's no way

1203
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:53,919
from everything that i've learned and

1204
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,078
everything that i've done there is no

1205
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,000
physical way that you can remove what's

1206
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,400
already in your plant so if you're at

1207
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,679
week nine and your plant is

1208
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,639
is

1209
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:04,799
obvious

1210
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,559
signs of of way too much nitrogen you've

1211
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,400
got the curling leaves you've got it's

1212
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:10,480
so green that you can like see yourself

1213
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,160
in it because it's mirroring back at you

1214
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,199
and you're saying oh i'm just going to

1215
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:15,118
throw uh

1216
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:17,679
10 liters of water in it right now and

1217
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,880
harvest it in a week

1218
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:20,480
and you're saying oh that's going to

1219
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,400
remove all those nutrients that's in

1220
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,318
that plant to give me a better smoke

1221
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,240
that's not happening and we just need to

1222
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:27,519
get that out of our brain because that's

1223
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:28,318
not happening and it's never going to

1224
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:32,239
happen

1225
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:34,880
the way what flushing is is that we are

1226
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:37,759
adding water to whatever we need to do

1227
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,039
to revive it to repair it to start it

1228
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,960
over is what we're doing if

1229
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:45,599
how i grow because i grow with top

1230
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,240
dressing and i my last top dress in

1231
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,920
flower is that six weeks of flower i

1232
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:51,279
don't feed anything except for water the

1233
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,119
last three weeks so a lot of people look

1234
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,200
at me like oh you're flushing anyways

1235
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,440
i'm like no no no no no

1236
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:59,838
i top dress it's slow release meaning

1237
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,599
over i top dressed six weeks meaning

1238
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:04,000
takes a week to start to slow reach so

1239
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,760
by week seven it starts to slow release

1240
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,239
into the roots now the plant's uptaking

1241
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,680
it so by week fall week eight it's

1242
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:11,838
getting full nutrients and then by the

1243
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:13,039
time week nine week ten when i harvest

1244
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:15,279
it's pretty much

1245
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:17,039
ate up all the nutrients in the soil to

1246
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,560
the point where it's now where i need to

1247
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:20,159
start adding it again so it's depleted

1248
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:21,838
all the nutrients and that's when i

1249
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:23,679
harvest so when it's depleted all the

1250
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:24,799
nutrients in the soil

1251
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:26,719
not

1252
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,839
me trying to force the nutrients out of

1253
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:28,719
the plant because that just doesn't

1254
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:32,000
happen

1255
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:34,159
and it is a daily topic on tbl i think

1256
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,519
just the term i think is just not used

1257
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:36,960
correctly because i just think people

1258
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:38,639
are thinking it's it's physically

1259
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,199
removing it out of the plant which is

1260
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:45,279
not it's i think if we just change the

1261
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:47,039
term of flushing to like revive or like

1262
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,200
final step or something like that i

1263
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:50,480
think it would make a lot more sense

1264
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,159
and then

1265
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,079
going into like the flushing products

1266
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:55,759
like there's a lot of products out there

1267
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,280
that are literally advertising this

1268
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,079
flushing stuff

1269
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,079
like

1270
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,720
put it at the end of your grow because

1271
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,079
you'll you'll you'll it'll rem do this

1272
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:05,838
and this and this and this and this

1273
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,039
right and you're thinking okay how is

1274
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:09,358
this working and then you look at a lot

1275
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,838
of these products they're they're

1276
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:14,000
they're humic they're fulvic acid based

1277
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:16,480
or they're magnesium based and all that

1278
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,960
stuff does is it breaks down what's

1279
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,039
already in your soil and it allows your

1280
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,039
plant to uptake it or it allows you to

1281
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:24,800
get it out of the soil faster

1282
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:26,719
so that's all that stuff does it's not

1283
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,079
doing anything to help break down your

1284
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:30,639
plants

1285
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,560
nutrients in the in in the cell walls

1286
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:34,318
and this and that it just doesn't work

1287
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,159
and i'm just hoping that the term

1288
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:37,759
flushing changes to the point where

1289
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:40,480
people are realizing flushing doesn't

1290
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,880
create white ash white ash doesn't mean

1291
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,599
quality uh smoke high

1292
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,480
um resinous plants

1293
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,079
will produce more of a black ash than a

1294
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,159
white ash and it's just known and that

1295
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,318
doesn't mean it's a lower quality plant

1296
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:56,480
it means it's full of resin which is

1297
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:58,960
perfect for extraction if that makes any

1298
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,880
sense yeah no it does there have been

1299
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,079
studies that that back up what you say

1300
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,240
as far as

1301
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:07,119
it doesn't change the nutrient content

1302
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:09,279
in the actual plant there have been leaf

1303
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,920
tissue tests done

1304
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,599
on flushed versus unflushed plants

1305
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,039
and they didn't show a difference you

1306
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,720
know so if you're flushing your plants

1307
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:18,239
at the end of the grow or or stopping

1308
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,000
nutrients at the end of the grow for a

1309
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:21,598
week or two weeks there was no

1310
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,639
difference there

1311
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,800
now you mentioned for organics

1312
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:29,039
you're feeding on week six or so right

1313
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,480
and so you you have that slow release

1314
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:32,239
and that the plant is basically fed all

1315
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,159
the way up until you chop it down

1316
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:36,318
harvest you know you mentioned you also

1317
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:39,358
grow synthetics are you feeding

1318
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:41,599
synthetics all the way up until harvest

1319
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:44,159
or are you stopping feeding at a certain

1320
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,240
point like a week before or two weeks

1321
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,719
before so the plant will start to

1322
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:50,639
senescence you'll start to get a fade

1323
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:52,078
happen before harvesting

1324
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:54,000
a fade happen

1325
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,240
uh if i'm using synthetics all the way

1326
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,800
through uh before i went to what i'm

1327
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:00,639
using now i i was using more of i think

1328
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,160
it was called a veganic

1329
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:04,000
mix so it was like

1330
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,879
it was organic to the point where they

1331
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,039
couldn't

1332
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,160
add the vegan solution so they add a

1333
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:09,599
synthetic

1334
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:10,559
variable to it so that's what i used to

1335
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,079
use

1336
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:15,759
and a lot of the guys who watch me can

1337
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:18,000
still use this same stuff and they are

1338
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,920
growing some of the nicest

1339
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
nicest plants i've seen

1340
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,960
a lot of them don't flush at all they

1341
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,760
push it right to the end i do think not

1342
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,559
feeding the last week i i think is is

1343
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,560
smart i i because i do think you don't

1344
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:34,639
want to harvest at a completely green

1345
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:37,039
plant i think it makes sense to harvest

1346
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:37,759
a plant that has a natural fade to it

1347
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:39,440
like

1348
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,200
it just makes perfect sense too because

1349
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,519
when the plant is naturally fading it

1350
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:45,118
means it is putting itself in the final

1351
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:46,880
life stretch

1352
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,440
means it is it is trying to push out

1353
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,358
more trichomes the the trichomes on the

1354
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,280
plant the resin on the plant is its

1355
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:56,159
defensive structures or its defense's

1356
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,560
mechanism so that when it is fading it

1357
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:01,199
the plant is signaling itself that this

1358
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:03,199
is my end this is my end i have to

1359
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,799
reproduce to either get myself going

1360
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:06,639
which is why i would

1361
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,560
pump out more resin to try and get

1362
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:09,358
pollen stuck to me right

1363
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,880
or

1364
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:14,159
we pump out more resin because that's

1365
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,200
the stuff that we want right so in turn

1366
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:17,440
that

1367
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,960
anytime i look at a fade in a plant that

1368
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,480
means in my opinion that means that

1369
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,559
plant is stressed or that means that

1370
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,400
plant is ready to go

1371
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,880
so when the plant is ready to go it

1372
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,519
means in my eyes it's already in its in

1373
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,760
it's in its final stage of pushing out

1374
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:33,920
those trichomes pushing out those colors

1375
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:36,079
doing whatever you need to to try and

1376
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,880
get the best possible plan in direct

1377
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:41,119
relation to that ice flushing another

1378
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,480
thing that people do in order to stress

1379
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,240
their plant at the end like you

1380
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,800
mentioned what are your thoughts on ice

1381
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:49,118
flushing i think it's like an old old

1382
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,640
method maybe that it's not the roots

1383
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,880
that you're trying to freeze more or

1384
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:54,639
less to bring out the color it's it's

1385
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,358
your a lot of the color is associated

1386
00:47:54,639 --> 00:48:00,480
with just the cold temperatures on the

1387
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:01,440
plant itself not so much the the roots

1388
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,960
so

1389
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,039
if like the way i look at a lot of

1390
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,039
people added the ice to the flushing to

1391
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:08,960
try and stress it out to try and bring

1392
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:09,920
out cool to bring out these cooler

1393
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,280
colors

1394
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,200
i i

1395
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,880
stressing any type of stress at the end

1396
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:16,239
i think is going to be a positive but i

1397
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,440
also think there's some that don't

1398
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:20,239
really work and there's some that do

1399
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,358
work i think people who are stacking all

1400
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:24,399
these different things like doing the

1401
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:25,598
ice flush during a 48 hour uh uh

1402
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,760
darkness

1403
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:32,000
during um uh a full um in pot trance uh

1404
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,280
or in pot drying cycle or something like

1405
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,358
that right like

1406
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,960
i think stacking all these things to try

1407
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:38,400
and increase the stress to try and oh

1408
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,280
try and get a better product i think is

1409
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,920
maybe

1410
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,359
doing a little bit too much i i i think

1411
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,880
if you want to try and bring out colors

1412
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:46,400
or try and stress it to bring out colors

1413
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,400
it's better for you just to

1414
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,720
put an ac or something in there i don't

1415
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,400
know if the ice bath personally is gonna

1416
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:54,558
really do what you want

1417
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,318
okay now how about the old stem

1418
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,119
splitting technique have you heard about

1419
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:00,558
that

1420
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:02,960
yeah i have people sticking like pencils

1421
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,880
and stuff through the actual stock and

1422
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,800
sticking like lego men through the stock

1423
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,400
to try and increase the uh

1424
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,280
increase of stress

1425
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,838
um

1426
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,400
i don't grow big enough plants inside to

1427
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:16,480
split my stocks like that

1428
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,559
if i'm growing a plant outside where my

1429
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,639
stock is big enough to split like that i

1430
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,240
would be worried for bud rod

1431
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:24,318
like i would be like the number one

1432
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:26,479
thing that you get outside around here

1433
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:29,119
is bud rod in your plants

1434
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,960
and it it goes through like broken like

1435
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,838
if you break a branch it'll it'll climb

1436
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,720
right through there it'll go it'll

1437
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:36,880
affect that whole branch like or um like

1438
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:38,959
so i don't really try to do too much of

1439
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,640
any type of breaking cutting or anything

1440
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,358
on my outdoor plants

1441
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:45,118
on indoor like i said the where i grow

1442
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:48,239
everything is so short that it's just

1443
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:50,400
not something i really looked into

1444
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:52,719
again it's an old technique just like

1445
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,400
the ice flush that i think

1446
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:55,838
there's other methods now that probably

1447
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,119
do the exact same thing without having

1448
00:49:55,838 --> 00:49:59,039
to drill a hole through the side of your

1449
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,640
plant

1450
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,480
all right last one

1451
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:04,960
blood washing so you've harvested your

1452
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,240
plants and you uh have gotten to the

1453
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,639
point where

1454
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:09,598
you wash your buds are you a bud washer

1455
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,318
or no

1456
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,318
so bud washing i suggest i always

1457
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:16,318
suggest for everybody to do bud washing

1458
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:18,639
like i know i have a lot of guys now who

1459
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:21,440
watch who do but they wash all of their

1460
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:24,558
butt they're indoor and they're outdoor

1461
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,880
um it's something because

1462
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:29,040
dust for an example organic

1463
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,720
some organic nutrients is a powder it's

1464
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:33,679
literally a powder and most of that

1465
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:36,719
powder is ground up bone ground up

1466
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:40,078
manure grout like ground up things that

1467
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:42,000
that are blowing everywhere it's it's

1468
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,160
and

1469
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,400
washing bud if you're doing it correctly

1470
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:47,920
and you're doing it where you're you're

1471
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,680
washing it and then putting it into a

1472
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,680
controlled space so you are drying it

1473
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:54,639
appropriately after

1474
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:56,879
can come out with perfect perfect bud

1475
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:59,759
if you're doing it sloppy where you're

1476
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,039
just oh i've got i've got wpm i've got

1477
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,480
issues i've got issues i got to quickly

1478
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:04,400
do this and then you try and dry it in

1479
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,920
the wrong conditions you're probably

1480
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:10,000
just causing a worse effect on it i've

1481
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,119
personally i actually did a test last

1482
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,159
year on

1483
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,960
a plant

1484
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:14,558
uh

1485
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,639
we had a storm that came through and

1486
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,960
knocked over one of my one of my outdoor

1487
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:20,719
plants and i had to

1488
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,639
um i wasn't able to fix it in time

1489
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:24,159
because i was on vacation so one thing

1490
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:26,159
after another the whole entire plant

1491
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:28,318
pretty much got infected

1492
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:30,159
so what i did is i cut off because with

1493
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:32,960
bud washing they said oh you can cut off

1494
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:35,519
all visible signs of bud rot you can cut

1495
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,960
off all visible signs of wpm cut off all

1496
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:40,239
that stuff and then throw it through the

1497
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,400
bud wash and then it'll it'll wash off

1498
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:44,318
off all the spores off all that stuff so

1499
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,440
that when you do dry it it doesn't

1500
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:46,318
regrow

1501
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,559
so

1502
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:50,159
i went through right on stream in front

1503
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,920
of everybody i went through a full

1504
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:54,078
hydrogen peroxide bath and i sat there

1505
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,000
and i was not being i wasn't being light

1506
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,839
with it i was being a little bit tough

1507
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,760
with it because i wasn't caring about

1508
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:02,078
ruining my bud i was caring about

1509
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,640
wanting to see if this worked or not

1510
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:07,200
i i knew for a fact that this plant had

1511
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:09,519
bud rot on it i cut off every visible

1512
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:10,719
sign that i could possibly see every

1513
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:13,199
single one of the branches went through

1514
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:15,279
a perfect hydrogen peroxide a lemon and

1515
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:17,759
baking soda and then just a freezing

1516
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,040
cold water and then at the end i even

1517
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,240
sprayed them all down just to try and

1518
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:22,159
make sure of any

1519
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:26,078
anything on the inside

1520
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:27,358
i put it into an environment that is

1521
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,599
that is

1522
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:32,318
more of a dry environment so it's less

1523
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:34,318
than 50 percent rh and you want to dry

1524
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:35,759
in a 60 60 environment yes i understand

1525
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:38,558
that but when your plants are soaking

1526
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,160
wet from from oh after a wash you don't

1527
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,079
you want to make sure your rh is low for

1528
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:43,920
the first couple of days so stuff

1529
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,559
doesn't have a chance of regrowing and

1530
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,358
then slowly increase your rh that or

1531
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:52,880
your rh attempts to that 6060 or close

1532
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:55,279
to it 60 rh 60 fahrenheit right

1533
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,280
what i found with the the washing is

1534
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,960
that even in that dry environment of

1535
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:03,200
that 45 rh to 50.

1536
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,119
in four days all of every single one of

1537
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:07,279
the branches that i took off that that

1538
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:09,039
uh that plant and did a full wash every

1539
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,519
single one of that blood rot again in

1540
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:13,679
four or five days because i either

1541
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:16,239
missed a single spore and i couldn't get

1542
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,239
it and it took off again

1543
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:20,318
or i missed a single spore of something

1544
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:24,399
and it took off again or whatever or i

1545
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:27,039
wasn't i i you the 40 humidity wasn't

1546
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:30,079
low enough or i didn't have enough fans

1547
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:32,639
on it so i think if you do it correctly

1548
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:35,599
to the point where your butt is not so

1549
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:37,440
dirty it will work but if you've got wpm

1550
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,359
all over your bud you've got bud rot all

1551
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,079
over your bud i personally don't think

1552
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:43,759
that even if you cut it off i do not

1553
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,920
think you're getting all of it off i

1554
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,760
think you if you were to test that bud

1555
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,480
after the full wash i still think you'll

1556
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,880
have counts of micro microbial bodies on

1557
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:56,000
you'll have you know it'll show up it

1558
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:59,760
might not it might not

1559
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:02,318
decline or not pass the testing

1560
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,160
or it might pass the testing story but

1561
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:05,920
you'll still have some counts of

1562
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:07,440
something on it in my opinion from

1563
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:11,039
everything that i've tried

1564
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,838
wpm is a huge problem here in ontario

1565
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,759
and

1566
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:15,119
it is every single outdoor plant you put

1567
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,680
outside you are pretty much going to

1568
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,039
have wpm you need to you you need to use

1569
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:21,838
some type of

1570
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:24,318
spray labs some type of spray to get rid

1571
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:26,558
of it to protect your plants or have

1572
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:29,199
genetics and plants that

1573
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,480
is resilient to that stuff right

1574
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:33,118
so

1575
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,960
that was the one thing i had i i the the

1576
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,480
the plant was perfectly fine all year

1577
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,798
until the storm came through and then

1578
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,159
all sudden the bud rot got into the

1579
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:41,599
plant which is what happens and then it

1580
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:43,199
goes through the stalk and then it takes

1581
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,559
off from the inside out

1582
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:45,759
and then you kind of get to the point

1583
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:48,559
where

1584
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,480
you've now got this plant that virtually

1585
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,240
or visually visibly doesn't have any bud

1586
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,639
rot gone through a whole wash you think

1587
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:56,159
there's none you dry it you

1588
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:58,400
you jar it or whatever and also you

1589
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:00,318
start [ __ ] or you start

1590
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,960
grinding it up or whatever like that and

1591
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:04,558
you've now got uh some little bits and

1592
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,798
stuff inside and you're like

1593
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,559
what is this what the heck is this

1594
00:55:06,798 --> 00:55:10,880
there's a couple things that might have

1595
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:12,640
made it worse is that the washing might

1596
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,880
have scented in even farther and if you

1597
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,879
have really dense buds you might have

1598
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,119
sent a spore or whatever in a little bit

1599
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,838
farther and it might have not been able

1600
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,838
to get out of it because

1601
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,838
the trichomes and stuff on the outside

1602
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:27,358
of a plant is almost like it's sunscreen

1603
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:30,159
so when you do put

1604
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:33,039
this branch inside water it's almost

1605
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:34,960
like the water it's hydrophobic almost

1606
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:37,279
and it's not until you really shake it

1607
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,960
in there where you actually get it where

1608
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,599
it might be going into the center of

1609
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,880
these these these flowers right

1610
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:45,039
if you're not

1611
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,960
really beating up your bud i don't know

1612
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:49,119
if it's really getting or going to get

1613
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,119
rid of that or we have to use higher

1614
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,480
amounts of hydrogen peroxide which then

1615
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,000
starts to kind of count well you're

1616
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,000
losing you're oxidizing all your

1617
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,079
terpenes you're oxidizing you're causing

1618
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,199
a lot of negatives this and that

1619
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,400
i i'm not against butter uh bud washing

1620
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:04,879
i just think that

1621
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,200
if your plant is too far gone i don't

1622
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,960
think suggesting bud washing is the best

1623
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:12,078
thing to do i think suggesting getting

1624
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:16,000
rid of it is probably better because

1625
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:18,000
i i'm i i'm so big on on molds and this

1626
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,639
and that the reason why

1627
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,639
i grow is because i don't know where

1628
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:24,639
others is coming from i know where mine

1629
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:25,679
is so if i have a problem i i can

1630
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:27,519
address it if

1631
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:28,639
if i don't know where that problem is

1632
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:30,639
there's no addressing and then i have

1633
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:33,759
that paranoia factor right

1634
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:35,598
so anytime i see any bud rot any wpm on

1635
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,520
my plant that plant immediately becomes

1636
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,960
a learning experience for me and i try

1637
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:41,039
to do everything i can to get rid of it

1638
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,440
either using blab spray milk spray and

1639
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:44,880
if i can't no hard feelings to me it it

1640
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,880
goes in the garbage i'm not risking it

1641
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,440
for me i'm not interested wow what an

1642
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,519
episode we talked about uh a bunch of

1643
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,358
different controversial topics

1644
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:54,880
and you had uh

1645
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:57,039
i was interested here that you had a lot

1646
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,240
of experience doing some of these small

1647
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:00,239
things like with the green light for

1648
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:01,759
example um you had some good findings

1649
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:03,838
there with the bud rot you had some good

1650
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,240
findings there of experiments that you

1651
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:08,558
did yourself in order to come to the

1652
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:10,000
conclusions you came to so that was

1653
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,839
pretty cool to hear

1654
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,838
um so wrapping things up how can the

1655
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:15,199
listeners find you and what do you have

1656
