1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,720
what's up everybody feel that don't know

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,609
me my name is Chris okay mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,769
you'll watching my extras channel Mars

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:09,870
hydro sent me over there TS three

5
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:12,300
thousand LED grow light in this video I

6
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,160
am going to test the power output and

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,469
I'm also going to do a heat test on it I

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,140
actually already did a part test and he

9
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:21,210
test and actually in Box this unit in a

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,910
previous video however in that video I

11
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,170
adjusted the dimmer to go up to 100%

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,268
Amara's hydro doesn't recommend

13
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,310
adjusting the dimmer to hundred percent

14
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:31,198
because it decreases the lifespan of the

15
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:33,058
fixture and I had some requests in the

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,390
comments section for me to do a part

17
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:37,890
test at factory settings which is 450

18
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,450
watts so that's what I'm going to do in

19
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,128
this video if you want to see the other

20
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,629
part test on this girl light I'll link

21
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:44,218
it down in the description section below

22
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:45,479
I also provide a link to this grill

23
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,340
light in the description section below

24
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:50,308
for the part test I'm gonna use the

25
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,649
apogee MQ 620 extended range par meter

26
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:55,320
this meter measures from 340 nanometers

27
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,179
to 1040 nanometers and the measurements

28
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,128
are in ppfd if this is your first time

29
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:00,509
watching my part test videos I do them

30
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:02,308
just to give you a general idea of what

31
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:03,329
the power output is they're not meant to

32
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:05,759
be a hundred percent accurate

33
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,560
I take measurements in grow tents which

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,210
have reflective walls that could

35
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,659
increase the numbers so just keep that

36
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:11,129
in mind

37
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,618
while on coverage area for this grow

38
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:15,329
light is 4 feet by 4 feet I'm taking

39
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:17,340
measurements in a four foot by four foot

40
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:19,289
Grovetown I've plugged this LED grow

41
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,030
light into my kilowatt meter and it

42
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,979
shows three point seven eight amps

43
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,710
pulling four hundred forty nine

44
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:28,400
watts from the wall alright let's get

45
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:28,399
into the measurements

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:02:23,639

what do you think of these measurements

55
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,209
let me know down in the comment section

56
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,800
below

57
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:19,479
just reminder that there is a link to

58
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,520
this grow light down in the description

59
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,560
section below along with that other part

60
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,750
tests I did where I adjusted the dimmer

61
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,889
to 100% that's pretty much it for this

62
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,689
video guys if you enjoyed it please

63
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:30,430
click that thumbs up and I will leave

64
