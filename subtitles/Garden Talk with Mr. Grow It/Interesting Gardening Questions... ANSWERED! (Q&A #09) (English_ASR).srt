1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,080
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,000
know me my name is chris aka mr growit

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,839
and i'm back with another q a video this

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,679
is actually the second part of the

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,359
previous q a video that i did there were

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,679
just too many questions i couldn't not

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,279
post some of these questions you guys

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,559
rocked it in the chat for those of you

9
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,640
that don't know i do record these

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,559
episodes live on twitch so if you want

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,320
to ask me questions in the future and

12
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:31,038
potentially get featured on an upcoming

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,640
episode follow me at twitch.tv

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,320
mr growit before we get into the episode

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,399
i just want to give a quick shout out to

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,840
the sponsor of the episode spider farmer

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,320
they're starting to sponsor these q a

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,160
videos so big shout out to them

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,238
spider farmer is well known to produce

20
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,839
high quality led grille lights at a

21
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:48,558
price lower than nearly all other

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,039
companies they have board style led grow

23
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:55,519
lights as well as bar style led grow

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:58,480
lights i've used their sf 1000 sf 2000

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,840
and sf 4000 led grill lights in the past

26
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,718
and i got some excellent results with

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,280
them they also have grow tents inline

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,280
fans and carbon filters i will leave a

products hello mr great i grew up with

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,479
the 11 13 light depth cycle for flower

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,840
these days 12 12 is talked about a lot

36
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:26,400
what are the benefits of 12 12 flowering

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,880
light cycle it really comes down to dli

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,400
1113 1212

39
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:34,879
dli look at dli first so um daily

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,799
lighting integral how much par are you

41
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,000
giving your plants your plant can only

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,040
take a

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,840
certain amount of light per day

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,360
right so how what is the what is that

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,799
and uh if you guys can hear my cat

46
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,399
scratching back there i'm not sure if it

47
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,880
picks up the audio but that's what that

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,399
staticky type noise was

49
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,478
um but dli right so you could literally

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,840
do a 12 12 light cycle let's say you're

51
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:01,359
blasting your plants with 900 ppfd

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,320
your plant's able to take it right and

53
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,000
that's

54
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,679
i need to pull out the dli calculator

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,040
don't i all right here we go dli

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,039
calculator

57
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,640
okay so let's say you have your

58
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,279
plants on

59
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,759
let's say you're doing 900 ppfd for 12

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,439
hours your dli is 38.8 a lot of people

61
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:22,000
say deal i have around 40 upwards of dli

62
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,840
of 60 if your conditions are right now

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,680
your environment is really going to be

64
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,598
an impact on this right

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,239
do you have optimal co2 you have a

66
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,238
limiting factor you know if your co2 is

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,120
low that's your limiting factor your

68
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,800
other

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,840
you know your plants can operate at that

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,840
level

71
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,719
vpd how's your temperature how's your

72
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,920
humidity but say you're you're dialed in

73
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:47,359
aiming for a 40 dli right you can either

74
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:50,238
do a 12 12 wide cycle with a ppfd of 900

75
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,400
or you could do 11 11 hours on but

76
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,680
increase your light distance

77
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,039
and blast them with uh 1100 ppfd so you

78
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,280
can literally you can save energy

79
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,239
consumption now it's only an hour a day

80
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,719
but

81
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,360
like i said some people go up to

82
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:08,560
60 dli so here we go right here if you

83
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,800
did 11 hour flowering lights on

84
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,280
ppfd at 1500

85
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,360
you would be reaching a dli of 60 which

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,439
is the highest you hear about so yeah

87
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,680
play around with that look into dli

88
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,680
speaking about vpd i've been tracking

89
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,840
mine per hour but the night temps have

90
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,319
dropped sharply at what temp during the

91
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,360
night period that would hurt the plant's

92
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,399
growth

93
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,760
so how much is it dropping

94
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,360
a lot of people generally speaking aim

95
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,359
for like a 10 degree drop if we're

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,760
talking fahrenheit so if your lights on

97
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,680
are about 80 degrees going down to 70

98
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,598
degrees lights off it's fine some people

99
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,439
do 15 degrees

100
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,959
if you're outdoors you're gonna you have

101
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,199
no control over that at all so you're

102
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,680
going to see some drastic swings from

103
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,280
day to night in some areas so

104
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,400
as far as what's bad

105
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,719
it starts to slo the lower the temp gets

106
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,480
the more growth slows down

107
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,158
right so the microbe activity in the

108
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,919
medium so say you're growing organically

109
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,000
for example you need to have the

110
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,438
microbes available

111
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,959
and working to break down those

112
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,639
nutrients if the temperature is too low

113
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,719
that slows down

114
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,079
microbial movement so you're not getting

115
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,080
that breakdown

116
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,280
so don't get too low i don't like to

117
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,840
really get below 60. i mean if i hit 60

118
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,198
degrees temperature i'm like ugh indoors

119
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,719
i think that pretty much answers your

120
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,360
question just try and try to stick

121
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,639
within like 10 degrees 15 degrees max

122
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,879
hopefully you can stay there if you need

123
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,478
to add in a space heater that's what i

124
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,879
have i have to add a space heater to my

125
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,879
grow room in my grow tents sometimes i

126
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,040
have a space heater in there as well so

127
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,319
the air coming into the grow tent is of

128
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,360
the proper temperature that's kind of

129
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,360
what i do cloning using clonex gel and

130
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,840
rooter cubes in a tray with a dome any

131
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,280
tips for successful rooting yes i think

132
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,239
one of the biggest things that people

133
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:52,079
overlook when they're cloning or even

134
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,478
seedlings when it's just starting to

135
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,800
root is the temperature in the medium

136
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,680
so unfortunately a lot of people uh they

137
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,759
don't

138
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,600
monitor that and

139
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,439
they have either poor germination rates

140
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,439
or their roots don't clone something

141
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,639
that i've struggled with and then once i

142
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,240
once i started monitoring the

143
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,360
temperature of the medium making sure

144
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,639
was above

145
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,600
72 degrees fahrenheit between 72 to 82

146
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,120
degrees fahrenheit is the general range

147
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,000
in order to have

148
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,680
clones root or seedlings sprout now if

149
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
you're in a basement you have your cups

150
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,079
on the ground solo cups on the ground

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,120
that's highly unlikely that things are

152
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,800
going to root

153
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,639
um even if it does

154
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,319
root it's going to be very slow growth

155
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,000
that's number one thing in my opinion

156
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,240
that a lot of people overlook is

157
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,319
monitoring the temperature in the medium

158
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,478
a lot of people have seedling mats some

159
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,680
seedling mats are stronger than others

160
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:42,879
uh some

161
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,439
you just gotta be aware they'll

162
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:48,079
literally burn they'll cook it your

163
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,839
plants i've struggled with that before

164
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,399
so i've sometimes i put towels in

165
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,079
between the seedling mat some towels

166
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,758
then the dome

167
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,038
and then sometimes that works but if you

168
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,600
can get one of those evening maps with

169
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,519
the probes and just stick the probe

170
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,680
in the medium that should give you a

171
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,359
general idea of how to do it now you

172
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,360
obviously don't want to soak the probe

173
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,439
at all so when you water the plants take

174
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,199
the probe out give it a little bit then

175
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,719
stick it back in

176
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,639
but yeah you can definitely get a

177
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,319
somewhat accurate measurement of the

178
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,000
temperature in the medium

179
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,319
hopefully you're in the general range

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,959
that needs to be to root uh but yeah the

181
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,759
clonex gel fruit cubes

182
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:28,000
that stuff will all work for sure um you

183
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,199
know if you're having a rooting hormone

184
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,319
there's several different rooting

185
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,319
hormones

186
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,039
you should have more success assuming

187
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,240
that your other conditions are fine i

188
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,240
have a space heater in my tent that

189
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,918
turns off when a certain temperatures

190
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,280
reach and then when it goes below a

191
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,519
certain temp

192
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,638
it'll turn on i assume is what you meant

193
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,478
unfortunately this causes a large amount

194
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,960
of temperature fluctuations throughout

195
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:51,279
the day my question is are these 10 to

196
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,439
15 degree rh fluctuations gonna

197
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,598
negatively impact my plants you're still

198
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,759
saying this just through ranges it just

199
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:58,800
changes constantly yeah great question

200
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,240
um

201
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,879
i mean good luck it's always gonna be

202
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,478
better to be more stable

203
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,800
if you have these swings throughout the

204
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,079
day i mean it's not ideal for your

205
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,759
plants

206
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,918
genetics something that genetics are

207
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,280
going to be more sensitive than others

208
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:14,560
i can't tell you

209
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,318
yes you're going to have a plant to get

210
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,598
so stressed out herms i'm not gonna i'm

211
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,199
not gonna be able to tell you you're

212
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:20,959
gonna be fine the best thing we could

213
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,560
say is you know you're staying in those

214
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,478
ranges let's hope you don't have those

215
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,399
sensitive genetics that are gonna turn

216
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,839
on you and try to limit the swings as

217
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,439
much as possible it sounds like you're

218
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,359
doing everything right maybe your

219
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,279
temperature is getting too high and then

220
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,639
your exhaust is kicking on sucking out

221
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,119
all the humidity

222
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,680
sucking out all the heat so then that's

223
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,759
what's maybe causing your problem maybe

224
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,519
if you try controlling the

225
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,038
temperature of the room that your grow

226
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,359
tent is in controlling the temperature

227
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,120
controlling the humidity so when the

228
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,879
humidity does reach too high or the

229
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,038
temperature does reach too high in your

230
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,879
grow tent and your fans turning on

231
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,560
assuming you have the ac infinity fan

232
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,280
then the air coming in will be of the

233
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,720
proper temperature proper humidity so

234
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,038
hopefully that helps

235
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,520
thoughts on monster cropping

236
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:07,598
so monster cropping what is it

237
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,159
we're talking about

238
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,560
taking a clone really it can be any part

239
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,000
of flowering right a lot of people say

240
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,160
late flowering

241
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,160
and then bringing it back re-veging it

242
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,160
if you need to conserve genetics

243
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,520
absolutely monster crops i don't have

244
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,439
anything against monster cropping i

245
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,198
think it's a technique that that you can

246
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,279
use i think it's probably probably

247
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,800
better to just cut a clone prior to

248
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,079
flowering and keeping that clone around

249
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,080
instead of

250
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,478
going the whole grow

251
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,399
then doing the monster cropping to bring

252
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,919
back that because when you go into that

253
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,519
re-veg period

254
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,478
it takes like a month in order to kind

255
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,480
of get into re-veg it can be hard to

256
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,480
kind of get that thing to root and to to

257
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,839
get back into re-veg it's just it's more

258
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,519
time-consuming

259
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,640
to do it that way how would you start a

260
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,639
run of build a soil craft blend first

261
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:57,439
well i mean what what soil are you

262
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,399
starting in are you starting in a bag

263
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,480
soil

264
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,240
if so i wouldn't add any craft blend in

265
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,039
there to begin

266
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,919
i would wait until you know 30 40 days

267
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,599
before i amend in some craft blend i

268
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,120
think it's one cup per plant if i

269
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,879
remember correctly i have to check the

270
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,560
the directions on that one but going by

271
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,320
the directions is is what i've been

272
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,239
doing starting a run with build a soil

273
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,000
craft blend like say you've done an

274
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,000
organic run you've completed say you're

275
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,519
in a 10 gallon container for example any

276
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,679
size container you've completed your

277
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,799
organic run you want to reuse the soil

278
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,639
first thing i would do is recommend

279
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,439
getting a soil test about 40 dollars

280
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,439
from logan labs going to soil doctor

281
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,519
getting those evaluated him telling you

282
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,560
what you need to do if you don't want to

283
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,799
do any of that which i totally

284
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,599
understand you know it does cost money

285
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,759
for those things just to mend in the cup

286
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,240
prior to planting you know i mean long

287
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,559
story short so like prior to planting

288
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,399
some people do a cover crop in between

289
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:51,759
and then let that die off and whether

290
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,759
they have clovers and they're getting

291
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,439
nitrogen fixation coming down in their

292
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,958
their medium it really depends on your

293
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,480
goal but i mean if you just use the

294
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,799
craft blend once you're finished with

295
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,039
your plant just digging up an area

296
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,078
putting in some craft blend and

297
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,199
you know planting it down some people

298
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:09,120
let it cook or let it sit for a week or

299
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,120
two sometimes even longer than that so

300
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,278
those amendments start to break down but

301
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,600
i've certainly planted directly into it

302
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,600
and have been fine when i always wear

303
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,639
veg i would only need to water every 45

304
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,000
days

305
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,480
during the second week of flower and

306
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,799
seem to want water two to three days now

307
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,399
is that normal based on my environment

308
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,078
there's gonna be a ton of contributing

309
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,879
factors to that right so you gotta

310
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,278
imagine the bigger plant gets the more

311
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,480
it's going to need as far as uptake of

312
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,240
water

313
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,079
nutrients your environment can certainly

314
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,639
have an impact in that right if you run

315
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:43,599
a very dry environment

316
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,919
like i live in the less humid it is

317
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,159
you're going to see higher transpiration

318
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:50,240
and so you can actually run into an

319
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,000
issue running too low of humidity where

320
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,680
you get a toxicity issue too much

321
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,200
nutrients in the medium

322
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,278
increased transpiration due to low

323
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,120
humidity you can actually get like

324
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,200
toxicity a lot even more from a prone to

325
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,278
a toxicity that way

326
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,600
but don it makes total sense for the the

327
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,439
medium to dry every two to three days i

328
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,519
mean it's it's building flowers you know

329
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,920
it's taking the nutrients and building

330
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,480
biomass right the bigger the plant to

331
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:16,639
get it is getting the more water and

332
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,159
nutrients that is going to need trying

333
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,600
to decide between building a clone or

334
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,838
setting up an auto water system what

335
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,278
would you prioritize first and why i

336
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,519
mean me personally i would probably go

337
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,200
and do the water watering system first

338
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,600
blue mats i mean you get a 12 pack of

339
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,200
blue mats for under 100 bucks and the 12

340
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,200
pack of blue mats

341
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,399
um i think you have to buy the reservoir

342
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,759
separately but literally you can buy

343
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,879
like a trash bin

344
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,639
or a small bin you know 15 bucks maybe

345
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,399
you can find them for 10 bucks as you

346
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,600
use that as a reservoir just drill a

347
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,600
hole in it

348
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,839
and run the line from there to your blue

349
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,360
mats and getting 12 of those carrots for

350
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,800
it i want to say it's like 80 bucks or

351
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,800
something like that you might be

352
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,919
maybe able to get them cheaper off of

353
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:58,319
happyhydro.com and using my discount

354
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,319
code mr growit you get a percentage off

355
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,000
there for so it might be cheaper than

356
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,680
going through amazon

357
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,278
but i would set up the auto water system

358
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,278
first and i would go with the blue

359
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,919
matches because of the cheaper ones i've

360
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,200
also used the auto pot system

361
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,039
and

362
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,200
it's just more expensive kind of prefer

363
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,039
the blue mats i found transplanting once

364
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,360
it seems to work best for me how many

365
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,719
times do you transplant before the final

366
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,480
container

367
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,600
man i've done so many ways over the

368
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,600
years

369
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,079
currently what i'm doing i'm planting

370
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,399
into one gallon containers to start and

371
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,078
then just doing one transplant into

372
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,759
seven gallon containers

373
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,278
that's what i've been doing

374
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:36,639
recently over the past few grows and

375
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,399
i've liked it

376
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,320
you know i've done the start out in solo

377
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,240
cups transplant up to one gallons

378
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,480
transplant up to three gallons

379
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,879
or transplant to one uh to one gallons

380
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,800
to five gallons bigger the roots bigger

381
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:52,000
the fruits is a term that a lot of

382
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,519
people say so being in a large container

383
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,839
during flowering

384
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,759
um is definitely going to help you now

385
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,639
as far as will the roots don't build up

386
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,720
kind of those root balls on a solo cup

387
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,759
then you get another root ball forming

388
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,200
in the one container then you get

389
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:06,799
another root ball you know what i mean

390
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,440
root ball within root balls some people

391
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:11,359
say that helps with bigger fruits

392
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,200
uh i i personally like to just start in

393
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,959
one gallon containers

394
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,040
and then transplant into seven gallon

395
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,638
tans i'm really liking doing that

396
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,559
or just planting in the final container

397
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,200
i mean i've done that it's just it's it

398
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,679
can be tough not to auto over water in

399
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,780
some cases especially especially if

400
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:36,329
you're a beginner

401
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:36,329
[Music]

402
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,200
turn it up
