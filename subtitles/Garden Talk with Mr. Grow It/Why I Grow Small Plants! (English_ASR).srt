1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,989
what's up everybody feed that don't know

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:05,609
me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,500
you're watching extras channel in this

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:10,050
video I want to talk about why I tend to

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,449
grow smaller plants I've been on YouTube

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,240
for a while now and most of my plants

7
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:16,980
are what I consider small and from time

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,969
to time I will get somebody to comment

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,310
on my videos and criticize or I guess

10
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:26,579
make fun of me or try to make fun of me

11
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:27,960
for growing smaller plants and not

12
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,689
really realize that that's what I'm

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,558
trying to do and so first what do I

14
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,869
consider small plants I consider a

15
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:39,359
medium-sized plant a plant that takes up

16
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:43,289
about two feet by two feet wide of grow

17
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:45,090
space with training and you know is two

18
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:47,280
and a half to maybe three and a half

19
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,590
four feet tall is like a medium sized

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,480
plant so anything smaller than that is

21
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,370
what I personally consider a small plant

22
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:55,679
now some of you may comment on this

23
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:57,479
video and say you're growing a medium

24
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,640
sized plant I think a smaller plant is

25
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,948
this that's fine everybody kind of has

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,430
their opinion on what size is small

27
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:08,908
versus medium versus large but I do like

28
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,710
to keep my plants smaller sometimes they

29
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,780
do training on the plants which make

30
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:14,849
them make the structure even smaller

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,829
than if I were to just let the plant

32
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:19,199
grow naturally and also aim for a

33
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:20,280
shorter veg time and that's gonna be

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,560
another thing that kind of keeps my

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,349
plants is small so why why do I do this

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,450
well for me I am a home grower I grow

37
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:29,188
just for myself I don't sell the

38
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,670
dispensaries I don't do any black market

39
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:34,739
stuff it's just for myself and I do have

40
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,140
a plant limit so in the state that I

41
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:39,839
grow in I'm allowed to grow twelve

42
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,609
plants max that's it twelve plants I see

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,609
one of the problems that I personally

44
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:48,090
have just growing for myself and this is

45
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:49,170
I'm saying it as a problem but I think a

46
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,469
lot of you gonna say that's a good

47
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,379
problem to have which is yielding out

48
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:57,718
too much for me to consume for example

49
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:59,519
if I were to grow twelve plants and grow

50
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:01,289
them out so they're medium sized let's

51
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,179
say they're three foot plants and let's

52
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,030
say they yield four ounces per plant

53
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,909
so twelve plants times four ounces that

54
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,469
equals forty eight ounces which is three

55
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:12,039
pounds three pounds is going to take me

56
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:14,318
a long time

57
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:16,298
consumed by myself so just hearing that

58
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,738
it might click for some of you okay so

59
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:19,870
that's why you grow small plants

60
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:21,849
my strategy is this I don't care about

61
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:25,060
biomass at all I don't care about maxing

62
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:27,789
out grow space I'm just looking to yield

63
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,199
around three ounces per plant that's all

64
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:30,729
I really need and most of the time I

65
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,548
don't need to max oh my plant count at

66
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:35,169
12 I can really do a growth cycle with

67
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:37,629
just six plants and then that's enough

68
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:39,669
for me to consume for several months if

69
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:41,500
not longer and I also like to grow of a

70
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:43,628
variety of strains so when I'm growing

71
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,250
out these smaller plants typically

72
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:46,719
they're all different strains and people

73
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,759
have been watching my channel for a

74
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,469
while know this but I get a lot of new

75
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:53,108
subscribers and a lot of people who know

76
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:55,209
my growth style so video like this where

77
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:57,609
I explained it is is overdue I guess so

78
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,979
if I can yield around 3 ounces per plant

79
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:02,049
per strain I'm gonna have a variety of

80
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:04,348
different strains to kind of work

81
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:08,169
through I also focus particularly on

82
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:10,268
quality instead of biomass again some

83
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:11,859
people are just going for yield they're

84
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:14,560
vegging out their plants for a long time

85
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:17,709
to looking for these large clusters of

86
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,098
buds me I aim specifically for quality

87
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:23,650
you know a lot of these newer exotic

88
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:25,598
strains are lower yield errs you know

89
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,359
you might not get as much biomass but

90
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,750
you're getting real smaller compact buds

91
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:33,489
that are just covered with trichomes and

92
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,079
you know I like strains like that but

93
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:37,090
there are people out there who don't

94
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,159
want that they actually prefer biomass

95
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,979
so different strokes for different folks

96
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:44,679
is what my friend Rob over at CLTV says

97
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:46,419
I think that applies to what I'm saying

98
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,250
here by the way shout out to him I've

99
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:49,870
got a shirt on here right now but yeah

100
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,000
that pretty much explains why I grow

101
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,579
smaller plants and I'd love to hear from

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,098
you watching this what's your overall

103
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:59,739
strategy do you go for yield do you try

104
00:03:57,098 --> 00:04:02,138
to maximize your space or do you not

105
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,120
worry about maximum outdoor space or

106
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:05,739
getting a yield just kind of grow your

107
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,209
plants for quality let me know what your

108
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:09,908
overall strategy everybody's different

109
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:11,829
everybody has a different approach to

110
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:13,750
growing let me know what you do down in

111
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:14,229
the comment section below and I'll leave

112
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,389
it at that

113
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:19,739
thank you so much for watching and until

114
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,739
next time face
