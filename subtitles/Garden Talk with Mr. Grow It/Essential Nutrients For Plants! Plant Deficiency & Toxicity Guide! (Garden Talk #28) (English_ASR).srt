1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,318
coming up on garden talk

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,240
a lot of people they talk about and i'm

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,559
one of those people is the harvest

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,039
tastes green right it just doesn't taste

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,718
natural why is that when you're pumping

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,959
your plant with the wrong nitrogen and

7
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,960
it's producing excess leaf or growing

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,800
too fast and your harvest comes out bad

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,480
well it's because what the plant is

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,560
doing right is producing more amino

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,960
acids for growth and not the proper

12
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,159
amino acids or peptides or proteins for

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,160
flowering or flavor manganese what it's

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,960
like how much manganese do we use and

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,679
why why is it responsible for over 300

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,600
enzyme coenzyme reactions why are we not

17
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,920
making it more significant right if

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,439
people are on well water well water for

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,960
some reason always has a lot of sodium

20
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,359
throwing sulfur in your soil it's going

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,239
to help regulate your ph i'm just blown

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,878
away by that right just one molecule

23
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,119
it turns the ether into reality where

24
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:56,280
you can touch it and i i'm fascinated

25
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,280
with that

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,359

116
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,598
people

117
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:12,959
and uh you know when i went to your

118
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,798
channel like i knew about your channel

119
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,920
probably about probably about six months

120
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,199
ago i think or something like that is

121
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,120
when i first found out about your

122
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,519
channel you've been on uh youtube for a

123
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,199
long time longer than that and you have

124
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,519
some really detailed videos with

125
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,560
you get into like a lot of science so

126
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,799
i thought you'd be a great person to

127
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,439
have on the podcast and uh we're going

128
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,439
to go over the essential elements for

129
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,519
plants today not all of them you know

130
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,079
there's a lot of them so we'll touch on

131
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:43,439
a good amount of them today and then

132
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,599
maybe maybe if the audience requests it

133
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,478
we can do a part two with the remaining

134
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,400
elements mark did a full presentation

135

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,519
start talking about some of the elements

149
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,000
there are pictures pictures of what

150
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,719
deficiencies look like toxicities

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,800
and so on and so forth so but first can

152
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,880
you introduce yourself kind of let us

153
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,560
know a little bit about you and how you

154
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,560
got into gardening

155
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,478
sure absolutely just before i start i

156
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,399
just want to encourage people to go down

157
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:40,800
to the description and grab the link i i

158
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,399
just like how just like how chris said i

159
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,000
created a presentation with tons of

160
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,000
pictures tons of things that you could

161
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,560
follow along with and in the future i

162
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,879
will expand this presentation to

163
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,360
other other plants so you'll be able to

164
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,879
do craft cross references with lots of

165
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,680
other plants

166
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,279
and not just be specific to one

167
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,800
okay so just want to get into family

168
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,279
history because in some level i think

169
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,800
it's super important

170
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,559
anyways to okay so georges bowell

171
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,879
created the irs our family hired the

172
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,038
first four thousand employees and worked

173
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:16,719
with abraham lincoln himself

174
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:18,399
we created the tracking system to

175
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,919
track the debt to pay

176
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,318
to pay back the centralized baking

177
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,758
system with the greenbacks so

178
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,240
moving on with that

179
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,759
my mother and father marquinida bowell

180
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,600
they were migrant farm workers they

181
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,000
developed the systems and processes for

182
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,000
harvesting packaging and distribution of

183
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,199
lettuce in monterey county from

184
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,759
1977 to 1989 production went from 1400

185
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,919
pounds an hour to over 65 000 pounds an

186
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,759
hour in only 12 years

187
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,918
the significant thing about that is the

188
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,160
farmers prior to this point couldn't get

189
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,318
past 1400 pounds and we're talking like

190
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,520
a 70 to 100 year span and they were

191
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,919
maxed out and their thought process was

192
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,680
why why try to grow more if they can't

193
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,879
harvest it and sell it

194
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,360
so

195
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,680
in addition to that a lot of the reason

196
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,080
why we use chlorine on food to extend

197
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,800
shelf life is because my father

198
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,318
um it's also the reason why our family

199
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,759
through many conversations we've

200
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,840
acknowledged

201
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,240
mineral deficiencies and people overall

202
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,799
because of what chlorine does through

203
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,560
the microbiology on plants so i think a

204
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,560
lot of this presentation is going to go

205
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,120
into the depth around

206
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,959
science because it talks a lot about how

207
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,079
all these things connect

208
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:34,239
after the uh during the 40-year family

209
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,719
span we also

210
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,280
at one point wore 35 million dollars

211
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,960
through construction flipping

212
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,598
fixing and flipping long-term rentals

213
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,918
from 89 to 2007.

214
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,519
uh we opened up a family loan office and

215
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,318
wrote over three billion dollars in

216
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,079
loans to home homeowners from 2003 to

217
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,080
2007.

218
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,318
at this point i joined the military to

219
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,959
12th para rescue in 2005 after dropping

220
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,360
out of college and this is where it

221
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,159
ended up really taking a twist and and

222
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,038
us

223
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,960
you know going heavy deep into uh the

224
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,360
other types of industries we actually

225
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:12,318
lost 34.75 million dollars in the real

226
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,840
estate crash in 2007-2008

227
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,000
we used the last bit of wealth to open

228
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,638
up perfect gardens in 2009

229
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,639
at the same time we started operated and

230
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,478
got busted the largest indoor grow

231
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,478
facility in the state of california from

232
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,240
2009 to 2012.

233
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,000
total operation expanded to a thousand

234
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,519
plus lights

235
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,399
the mushroom farm is what we called it

236
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:34,958
plus we rotate it through between 35 and

237
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,120
70 miner operations averaging six to 20

238
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,038
lights per operation

239
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,799
and a grow coach each and every one of

240
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,399
these people until stands were met

241
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,278
consistently

242
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,399
after that i started a

243
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:50,000
half acre grow from december 2013 to

244
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,440
2015

245
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,080
harvested approximately five thousand

246
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,240
pounds before being shut down

247
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,800
then went on to develop a new industrial

248
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,919
water extraction method for large-scale

249
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,479
large-scale

250
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,159
extraction thousand-plus acres

251
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,839
i only went into the research and

252
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:09,759
prototype phase got shut from

253
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,560
2014-2018 and then we completed the

254
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:15,679
largest uh hemp biomass transaction in

255
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:18,000
the united states in 2018 that was 800

256
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,399
000 pounds from oregon to colorado it

257
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,240
was 39 million deal followed up by a

258
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,519
two-year lawsuit for unpaid commissions

259
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,600
so as you can

260
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,240
as you can tell we've had successes and

261
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,480
failures what i can say is our failures

262
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,159
have led to other successes so don't

263
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,399
give up want to get into perfect garnish

264
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:39,519
real quick our vision is can a farmer i

265
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,839
think canada farmers are going to solve

266
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,360
our world's ag problems our mission here

267
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,959
at perfect gardens is we help you grow

268
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,800
our values as integrity putting the

269
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,119
shopping cart back every time

270
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,838
sustainability doing our due diligence

271
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,759
and

272
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,920
being present one problem one solution

273
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,360
at a time just for food for thought for

274
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,439
everyone think about who's growing and

275
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,600
who's farming right now we have grandmas

276
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,040
grandpas community gardens can of

277
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,800
farmers and then large-scale

278
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,278
corporations

279
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,559
they grow 98 of the food and they they

280
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,278
encompass only two percent of the

281
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,119
population those average farmers that

282
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:13,039
own all that land is

283
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,039
their ages between 60 and 70 and their

284
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,120
one heart attack away from dying

285
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,958
i think the most unique thing about the

286
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,440
county industry is that we have created

287
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,039
a very inexpensive way of testing the

288
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,600
quality of these plants through testing

289
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,599
the terpene profiles and i think by

290
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,440
cross referencing these

291
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,120
terpene profiles we'll be able to

292
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,200
examine our

293
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,120
ad growing practices and hopefully scale

294
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,519
up healthier growing practices as the

295
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,240
canada farmers take over the land in the

296
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,560
next 10 to 15 years as obviously the

297
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,278
industry collapses so you have a real

298
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,359
long family history here

299
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,399
real extensive and it goes way way back

300
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,560
i mean you started 1862 and there's a

301
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,278
lot of successes in there some major

302
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:58,078
numbers and even included some loss you

303
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:00,320
know that that tragic loss you had

304
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,838
with the real estate crash but again you

305
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,920
had mentioned that you know you had

306
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,720
successes and failures you just got to

307
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:09,519
keep on going right and after that big

308
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,040
failure that you had in 2007-2008 i mean

309
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,278
it looks like it even

310
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,159
you had even a greater success right so

311
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:18,320
taking a step one step back two steps

312
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,240
forward type scenarios so that's really

313
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,320
cool it's really interesting and um you

314
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,720
know congrats on all your success so far

315
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,959
with that and and perfect gardens right

316
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,720
i went to that website there it's a nice

317
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,359
website you get a lot going on there so

318
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,200
yeah thanks for that introduction um

319
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,720
let's continue on i know the next thing

320
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,399
up that you want to kind of talk about

321
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,639
here that's on your presentation is the

322
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,039
law of minimum so you want to get into

323
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,559
that a little bit absolutely so there's

324
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,199
two laws that i think are being

325
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:47,199
overlooked dramatically and a big ag all

326
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,920
the way down is the law of minimum first

327
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,160
one law minimum states that the growth

328
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,958
is dictated not by the total resources

329
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,879
available but by the scarcest resource

330
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,638
and i'll give you an example let's say

331
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,799
you have all the minerals the best

332
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,399
lights best sun but you're not watering

333
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,838
your plants

334
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,600
well at that point that's the scarcest

335
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,600
resource in your plants die

336
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,240
that goes along the same with trace

337
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,040
minerals macro minerals light

338
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,480
temperature humidity everything so

339
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,639
that being said

340
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,560
mark twain said whiskey is for drinking

341
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,278
water is for fighting just to give

342
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,000
another example if i may um please you

343
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:23,838
know

344
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,559
co2 is one of those things you could

345
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,720
have your environment dialed in

346
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:31,039
proper temperature humidity everything

347
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,959
could be you know properly watered it

348
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,958
could have the proper nutrition the

349
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,719
lighting could be dialed in right but if

350
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:40,399
your co2 level is low your plant's just

351
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,278
going to operate at that level and

352
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,958
that's really the law minimum right and

353
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:46,639
again another example would be you could

354
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,518
have everything dialed in with

355
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,639
the co2 but say you you don't have vpd

356
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,240
dialed in for example right the

357
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,240
temperature humidity the the leaf

358
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,560
surface temperature it'll operate at

359
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,399
that that lower level so

360
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,559
yeah that's uh that's something that we

361
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,799
don't talk about a lot much at all

362
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:05,278
really so i'm glad you covered that how

363
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,120
about the larv tolerance absolutely so

364
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,879
the law of tolerance and just to talk

365
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,879
exactly what you're saying too i think

366
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,559
it's because everyone's trying to sell

367
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,559
something right and so they're trying to

368
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,319
market their thing as being the best

369
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:20,000
thing versus encompassing everything as

370
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,200
a whole and as an ecosystem so let's get

371
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,639
into a lot of tolerance exactly what

372
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,320
you're saying so the law of tolerance

373
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,120
states that the laws

374
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,360
a law stating that the abundance and or

375
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,078
distribution of an organism can be

376
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,560
controlled by certain factors where

377
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:37,199
levels of these exceed the maximum or

378
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,559
minimum limits of tolerance of that

379
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,360
organism

380
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,958
so

381
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,759
in the extremes

382
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:46,078
absolute minimum or too much you have

383
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:48,159
zones of intolerance then because these

384
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,759
plants are so all plants are amazing

385
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,278
they they want to grow they'll do

386
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,679
everything in their power to produce i

387
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,198
mean i mean just don't water a plant for

388
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,958
a week and then come back and water it

389
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,078
you'll have it it'll probably come back

390
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,479
believe it or not

391
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:03,278
then you have your your zone of

392
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,879
your tolerance range right where you're

393
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,039
you know you might just be kind of

394
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:08,559
paying attention watering every so often

395
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,000
and then you have your optimum range

396
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,159
where you're you're carrying about

397
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,159
everything drip irrigation your

398
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:15,600
microbiology you're caring about your

399
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,159
lights everything you're saying and

400
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,480
that's your optimum range the visual

401
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,600
that you have here is is is perfect it

402
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,759
provides a

403
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,040
great visual ph i think is one that i

404
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,278
kind of want to highlight and talk about

405
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,958
for a second i mean it shows like an

406
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,600
optimum range

407
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,198
for ph so you know generally speaking i

408
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,519
think a lot of people what they go by

409
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:38,319
for soil ph for example for the plant

410
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,759
that we all know and love is for soil ph

411
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,480
you're often said in between 6.0 and 7.0

412
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,600
ph now that might be the optimum range

413
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,278
right but

414
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,159
oftentimes they'll get growers that say

415
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:52,480
oh my ph is i'm in soil in my ph is 5.8

416
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,559
or my ph is 5.7 i'm like well how does

417
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,800
your plant look plant looks fine well

418
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:59,838
that just goes into your tolerance range

419
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:02,159
right so that lower ph maybe 5.5 for

420
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,199
example down as low as 5.5 is in your

421
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:07,120
tolerance range now you probably won't

422
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,879
get optimum nutrient uptake there could

423
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,198
be some issues with slow growth

424
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,198
potentially and so on and so forth

425
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,879
but having an optimum range and then

426
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,120
that tolerance range

427
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,519
um yeah i think this this paints a great

428
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,278
picture for a lot of folks and i see

429
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,078
temperatures in there as well it's the

430
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:26,000
same thing so yeah i'm glad you put this

431
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:28,239
in here as well i think you gave great

432
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,639
examples actually i mean so thank you on

433
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,159
that i appreciate it how about the next

434
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,759
yeah

435
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,679
sorry sorry

436
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,560
okay so the next slide the next slide i

437
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,039
think is absolutely incredible it it if

438
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:43,359
you and just to describe it it's a it's

439
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,360
a circle and it has tons of minerals and

440
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,600
not all of them it's just another a few

441
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,759
of them and then what i'm doing is i'm

442
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,680
showing how all these different minerals

443
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,120
correlate right and so

444
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,039
this is the first time where i want to

445
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,440
use some terminology where i think this

446
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,519
many industries are throwing things out

447
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,160
trying to confuse people from marketing

448
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,440
and to just capitalize on the roi and

449
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:07,278
that's fine but i i want to you know

450
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,600
bring you behind the veil in the sense

451
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:12,720
so every single time different minerals

452
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,639
work together that becomes a coenzyme

453
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,399
production situation i'm going to show

454
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,240
you that in science so i just every

455
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,839
single time when i say bacterias make

456
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,000
coenzymes

457
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,560
so so when i say that

458
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,958
or i say aids in activating coenzymes

459
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,359
think of this chart because it's gonna

460
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,638
it's gonna explain oh wow okay so

461
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,039
you know these minerals all these

462
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,120
minerals work together you know so i'm

463
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:37,439
only when you flip your bottle back you

464
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,600
know be in the back and you look at it

465
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,560
you know you only have mpk or you only

466
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,560
have a couple macro minerals think about

467
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,399
this chart because what are you missing

468
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:49,278
going into what you're just saying um

469
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,360
mobile and immobile nutrients so at this

470
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,439
point this next chart if if you didn't

471
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,278
want to listen to the rest of this this

472
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,759
this podcast which i highly recommend do

473
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:59,600
so to geek out on it but if you if you

474
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,120
don't want to this chart this next one

475
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,040
is going to really just break it down

476
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,199
for you and make it super simple simple

477
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:07,599
to identify your problems or narrow it

478
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,199
down to what it most likely is so

479
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,719
there's three things i want you to

480
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,000
absolutely remember

481
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,360
immobile

482
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,599
mobile and semi-mobile so immobile

483
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,198
nutrients will if there's a deficiency

484
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,159
or excess it's going to appear in the

485
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,160
newer leaves and so why is that right so

486
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,959
immobile nutrients is when the plant

487
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,880
needs nutrients at one specific time and

488
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,120
won't need it anymore so if it doesn't

489
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,880
have it while it's growing or producing

490
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,479
it's going to show up as immobile

491
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,400
nutrient because it doesn't have what it

492
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,360
needs at that one point

493
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,798
to grow properly mobile nutrient shows

494
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,479
up in the

495
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,639
in the older leaves

496
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,558
first why because the plant can rob that

497
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,960
nutrients from the older leaves and take

498
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:51,200
it to the newer leaves to do its newer

499
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,600
function growing flowering producing

500
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,038
whatever that looks like semi-mobile is

501
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,678
nutrients can actually show up in the

502
00:17:55,038 --> 00:18:01,119
older or newer and sometimes it's

503
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,120
finicky sometimes it's going to

504
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,798
matter on the ph it's going and it's

505
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,279
going to adjust so just know that

506
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,918
semi-mobile nutrients can show up in the

507
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,119
older or newer and as we go further down

508
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,320
through the pictures i'm going to show

509
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,000
you very

510
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,599
clear like once i show you the picture

511
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,599
you're gonna be like oh okay i've seen

512
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,399
this you know just because we've all

513
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:22,399
seen it it just you you have to

514
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,240
you and there's so many so many

515
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,640
deficiencies that look similar because

516
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,798
there's secondary deficiencies

517
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,200
underlying it that you it's difficult to

518
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:34,079
really identify and when you when you

519
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,160
see over a million plants and a number

520
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,678
of different different plants from just

521
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,360
just one you see a whole bunch of them

522
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,960
you see this deficiency it becomes oh

523
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,199
it's really clear okay this is what it

524
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,600
looks like so

525
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,360
let's go ahead and get into it well one

526
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,480
thing i want to mention before we move

527
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,558
on is

528
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,240
this chart right here i mean it breaks

529
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:54,558
it down between primary nutrients

530
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,679
secondary nutrients macronutrients it

531
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,839
has the

532
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,759
symbol there and then i assume that

533
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,959
third column correct me if i'm wrong

534
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:06,480
mobile or immobile so for nitrogen yes

535
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:09,279
as mobile right or is mobile yes or no

536
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,880
right yes so yeah for example

537
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,200
and i'm sure we're going to go on this

538
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,760
uh on once we talk about nitrogen but

539
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,120
nitrogen is a good example i think a lot

540
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:18,000
of beginners would

541
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,678
would

542
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,960
come across a nitrogen deficiency and

543
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,038
realize that the bottom part of the

544
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,279
plant the leaves are going to start to

545
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,798
turn yellow from the tips moving up and

546
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,960
what's happening is it's a mobile

547
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,879
nutrient that's being relocated to the

548
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,558
new growth but yeah i won't jump too

549
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,280
ahead i'll let you keep on going on

550
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,119
there

551
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,879
no you're perfect exactly how you're

552
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:38,719
describing i don't want to like you said

553
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,880
if if we stop at a certain point we'll

554
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,480
come back to a part two and you know i

555
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,720
think the most important thing is just

556
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,400
coming into that awareness part of

557
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,160
yourself where you're exactly what

558
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,320
you're feeling you're like okay it's

559
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,960
starting in the in the old growth and

560
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:54,159
it's turning yellow so the and and look

561
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,319
at where it's starting at the leave and

562
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,919
you're starting to really realize oh wow

563
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,519
you know it's it's robby and you're

564
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,280
taking it you're starting to identify

565
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,519
how it's showing up whether it's showing

566
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,639
up on the tip or it's showing up right

567
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:08,480
where the the stem meets the the leaf

568
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,559
because all these things will show small

569
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,558
characteristics of what's what's

570
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:14,639
happening within the plant and like they

571
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,319
say it's like like an animal whisperer

572
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,600
right but you become a plant whisperer

573
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:19,200
and it's just because you're you're

574
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,439
seeing these commonalities so thank you

575
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,519
for actually pointing that out

576
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,240
that's very helpful actually so next

577
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,679
slide two ways to fix uh fix most of

578
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,000
problems okay so we're gonna keep it

579
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,880
simple again rest again most of the

580
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,240
slide is about geeking out this the how

581
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,919
to solve my problem is that's what most

582
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,919
people are concerned about two ways

583
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:42,000
flush a plant ph it and restart or which

584
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,000
most people don't talk about is balance

585
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,319
the minerals and that goes into play at

586
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,480
the law minimum and the law of tolerance

587
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,079
okay so let's dive into the first one

588
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,759
nitrogen

589
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,960
and i want to talk about the nitrogen

590
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:56,798
cycle because i and this one it breaks

591
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,200
down the chemistry really well but i

592
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:01,679
want you to use this as a as a mental

593
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,840
template as we talk about calcium

594
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,360
magnesium phosphorus and all these other

595
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,359
ones because

596
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:10,000
there are many different chemical

597
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:12,079
manufacturers out there that

598
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,400
make other types of chemicals

599
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,839
and and then they mark it as nitrogen or

600
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,840
phosphorus or whatever so i'm going to

601
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,918
show you right here by science how

602
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,759
science uses nitrogen how how it changes

603
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,200
the molecular structure and then i'm

604
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,919
going to show you how there are other

605
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,000
nitrogens that come up in this industry

606
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,679
or other big ag industries

607
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,519
and why are they putting that nitrogen

608
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,200
in there when there's when there's the

609
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,119
natural nitrogens that are fertilizer

610
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,798
that they can synthesize and sell

611
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,038
that are just as available and

612
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,960
relatively close to the same price

613
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:42,640
and i don't know why they do it but it

614
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,720
is what it is

615
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,559
all right so the nitrogen cycle

616
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,798
so there are five parts of the nitrogen

617
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:52,079
cycle there's a nitrogen fixation a

618
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:55,918
stimulation a modification nitrification

619
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:59,038
and denitrification so nitrogen fixation

620
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,240
is basically when the nitrogen gas and

621
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,599
let's say electricity bulge or

622
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,400
electricity fires off ends up

623
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:08,798
a turning um ends up electrifying

624
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:13,280
nitrogen and turns it into nitrogen

625
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:15,279
dioxide so it goes from in n2 to no2

626
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,519
okay so then when that's electrified it

627
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:21,119
combines to water and then becomes a

628
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:23,759
nitric acid so nho3

629
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:26,399
and so that entire process is nitrogen

630
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,158
nitrogen fixation so then when it comes

631
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,759
down to the ground the plants can

632
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,320
actually take up the nitric acid that's

633
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,720
why things uh things turn green right

634
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,839
after if you're and and all that stuff

635
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,839
people know what i'm talking about when

636
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:40,639
i when if they watch the

637
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:42,879
mountains or the fields after a rain so

638
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,720
that nitrogen acid though when the

639
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,480
bacterias get ahold of it the bacterias

640
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,720
will begin to convert it over into

641
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:53,279
ammonia and so ammonia is in h3

642
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,880
okay and then as it gets assimilated

643
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,558
into the plant and the bacteria can

644
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,880
continue to keep converting it turns

645
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:01,839
into ammonia ammonium was which is nh4

646
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,320
plus

647
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:06,399
and then as the plants take take it up

648
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,359
and die or animals die

649
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,840
the fungi actually hold on to the

650
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,199
ammonia and convert it into nitrites and

651
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,359
nitrates and

652
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,519
slowly release it back into the

653
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:20,558
environment so as the plants take it up

654
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:23,839
it's assimilation as the plants die

655
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:26,158
it's a modification and as the fungi

656
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:27,599
hold on to it and and slowly release it

657
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,080
back into the environment it's

658
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,119
nitrification and then as

659
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,000
the

660
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:37,519
force is burned down or or evaporation

661
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,720
happens then that is denitrification so

662
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:40,480
these things go back up into the

663
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,798
environment so that's the complete cycle

664
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,319
and so correct me if i'm wrong but you

665
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:46,319
pretty much explain to here is that the

666
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,599
the plant can uptake multiple forms of

667
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:49,678
nitrogen and that's one thing that's

668
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,879
kind of unique about nitrogen from my

669
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,159
understanding so the the nh4 plus

670
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,880
i think you explain that they're able to

671
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,799
uptake and then the no3 minus the

672
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,320
nitrate is what they're able to uptake

673
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:01,679
is that correct to my understanding

674
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,558
they're actually able to take up three

675
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,440
of them

676
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:05,278
and this

677
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,159
this is what the this is what the

678
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:10,079
fertilizer industry tries to replace

679
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,679
uh for this process so it replaces tries

680
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,000
to replace the fungi and bacteria

681
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,880
because the fungi bacteria do the

682
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,440
conversion the enzyme the coenzyme um

683
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,960
reaction process or cation or

684
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,759
anions and we're going to get into that

685
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,000
later the the terminology of this stuff

686
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,798
but basically the fungi and bacteria do

687
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,400
these conversions and so what science

688
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:31,679
does is it removes the fungi and

689
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,159
bacteria

690
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,840
conversion it does it does it for us and

691
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,440
you you'll actually see right over here

692
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,918
and i'll go into the next slide before i

693
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,720
go into these the other nitrogens that

694
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,320
this the industry uses so let's just go

695
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,278
real quick into nitrogen what is

696
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:49,678
nitrogen because i think it's described

697
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:51,839
isn't described properly so nitrogen is

698
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,240
the building blocks of amino acids

699
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:57,038
peptides and proteins so amino acids

700
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,839
peptides and proteins are mainly i mean

701
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,278
are made of organic compounds so what

702
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:04,480
are organic compounds right organic

703
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:06,400
compounds are carbon hydrogen oxygen

704
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,960
nitrogen and sulfur

705
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,759
those things are i think become really

706
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,640
interesting for me at this point because

707
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,798
because in science in science for human

708
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,679
beings and plants there's actually a

709
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:21,759
disconnection of what are what are when

710
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,640
when amino acids become peptides and

711
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,839
when peptides become proteins and so for

712
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,600
for me i've had to do

713
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:32,240
to um create my own terminology or my

714
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:33,278
own definition basically and so amino

715
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,960
acids

716
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:38,798
are basically within one to ten you know

717
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,240
individual acids and when they when they

718
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:42,400
come together they

719
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,640
more they will become peptides

720
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,559
and so those those are

721
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,559
creations of again

722
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,798
carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and

723
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:52,399
sulfur but then when they be combined to

724
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:54,558
a mineral that's when they become a

725
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,559
protein and so that's my definition

726
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:58,798
that's something that reading all these

727
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,278
different things and all that all that

728
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,639
stuff i i feel like when it be binds to

729
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,319
the minerals that's when it actually

730
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,880
becomes a protein

731
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:09,119
so in the nitrogen cycle there are seven

732
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,480
chemical structures uh structures

733
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:14,239
nitrogen goes through and we talked

734
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,319
about that n2 no2 in h03

735
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,278
in h3

736
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:21,000
in h4 plus in

737
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:24,640
o3 negative and

738
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,200
nh2 negative my question is why does the

739
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,799
ag industry use four plus nitrogens

740
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,600
outside of the natural

741
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:33,440
natural nitrogen cycle you know so they

742
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:34,719
they're putting stuff like ammonium

743
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,919
nitrate

744
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,079
ammonia nitrogen and urea and there and

745
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,679
a number of other different nitrogens in

746
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:45,839
other videos i show you a whole bunch of

747
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,559
different nitrogens and those are in h4

748
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,240
in

749
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:52,079
o3

750
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,599
in h3 negative n and co

751
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:57,038
in h32 to the second power so i'm not

752
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:58,879
going to do that every time but i'm what

753
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:00,879
i'm really just trying to show you guys

754
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,960
is that there are all these different

755
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,120
types of chemical structures and there's

756
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,319
natural chemical structures that nature

757
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:10,399
goes goes through that that the these

758
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,000
chemical companies can actually use

759
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,759
these or you can just go to the store

760
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,519
look in the back of the bottle and see

761
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,599
what the chemical structure is and if

762
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:19,679
they're not using the natural net

763
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:21,199
chemical structures put the bottle back

764
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,840
because it's only going to destroy the

765
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,440
microbiology let's so nitrogen nitrogen

766
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,839
is a mobile nutrient we already talked

767
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,720
about that so we won't get too heavily

768
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:30,000
into

769
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,798
the

770
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,480
into it but i do kind of want to explain

771
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,480
a little bit around excess right so if

772
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,159
you're giving too much nitrogen why is

773
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,159
that because they're using urea and so

774
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,200
what does nitrogen do it it's amino

775
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,278
acids peptides and and what it what does

776
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,038
amino acids and peptides are are meant

777
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:49,200
for they're meant for the growing part

778
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:52,000
of of these things so why so that's why

779
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,159
the stem will elongate and that's why

780
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,640
the stems will become weak and it's

781
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,039
actually the reason in many cases why we

782
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,000
sell this industry sell so much bamboo

783
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:04,398
and support equipment is because of the

784
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
chemical it's actually it's like solving

785
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:10,158
the problem because not being thoughtful

786
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,640
where the problem got started right and

787
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:15,278
so we start to create other solutions to

788
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,038
to minimize uh minimize that problem in

789
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,798
a sense we're talking about too much

790
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,158
nitrogen the plants get really dark

791
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:23,440
green i mean to the point where it's

792
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,360
fake and you you can tell i mean it just

793
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,840
doesn't look good and then a lot of

794
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:30,079
people they talk about and out and i'm

795
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:32,319
one of those people is the harvest

796
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:35,519
tastes green right it just doesn't taste

797
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:37,278
natural why is that is because those uh

798
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:38,960
in in the beginning they're using a

799
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:40,398
whole bunch of nitrogen and i'll show

800
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,759
you in the chemical structure the whole

801
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:47,199
bunch of nitrogen in initial amino acid

802
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:50,398
coenzyme process with the bacterias

803
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,960
where to to grow right but then when you

804
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:55,439
when you do when those nitrogens in

805
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,360
those organic compounds combine to the

806
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,600
trace minerals the smaller minerals

807
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:01,759
later they're used later in the plant

808
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:04,000
and so and they're using totally

809
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,679
different ratios so that's why when

810
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,839
you're pumping your plant with the wrong

811
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,159
nitrogen and it's producing excess leaf

812
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:12,480
or out growing too fast and your harvest

813
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,000
comes out bad well it's because

814
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,839
what the plant is doing right is

815
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,480
producing more amino acids for growth

816
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,798
and not for the proper amino acids or

817
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,640
peptides or proteins for flowering or

818
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:23,918
flavor and that's why a lot of people

819
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,919
are

820
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,440
they say they flush at the end of the

821
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,600
cycle and i don't know if i'm jumping

822
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,200
ahead here but like um

823
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:32,158
it kind of opens up a can of worms

824
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,558
because there's gonna be so many people

825
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,919
that say oh flushing is pointless and

826
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,639
then there's gonna be people that say

827
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,159
flushing is a must you know and i think

828
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,640
you hit the nail on the head here the

829
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,000
excess nitrogen and i did i know there's

830
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,679
been studies that came out and actually

831
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,759
did a video on a study that came out on

832
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:51,120
flushing and one of the things that i

833
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:53,119
had said as kind of my thoughts is that

834
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,918
i like to see that fade in the leaves i

835
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:58,558
like to i like to see that senescence um

836
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,120
you know because i i also felt like i've

837
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,960
had plants where it had excess nitrogen

838
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:04,479
and i did have that taste so i

839
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,159
personally do look for that fade to

840
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,399
happen now whether or not i have to

841
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,960
flush the plant it you know it depends

842
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,798
on if i'm seeing that fade or not but

843
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,640
yeah i'm glad you brought that up as far

844
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:16,558
as the harvesting tasting green to the

845
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,880
excess nitrogen because i personally

846
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,960
felt like i i've encountered that before

847
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,799
i actually love you brought the the

848
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,240
whole fleshing topic up for just a

849
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:25,839
second because

850
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,919
it's really funny right you have you

851
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:30,879
have a polar complex going in the

852
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,840
industry from flower to extracts right

853
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,760
so

854
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,038
and this is everything it's it's it

855
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:36,798
doesn't matter you know whether you're

856
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:38,640
in the sugar industry or whatever you

857
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,558
know it's about harvesting and then

858
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,640
packaging up as tight as possible to

859
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:44,558
sell it to the end consumer to be

860
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,480
reinfused into other products and and

861
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:48,720
sold even again

862
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,558
the the point to this is that

863
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,640
the flushing process

864
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:55,038
and i really loved what you what you do

865
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,360
with that because it actually helps me

866
00:30:55,038 --> 00:31:00,079
even think a little bit more about it

867
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,398
and when and i and i don't know if you

868
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:04,480
thought about this part right so when

869
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:07,359
when you take the end product and take

870
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,038
it to the extraction team what what was

871
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:10,879
their issue with it right too much

872
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:12,960
chlorophyll in the extraction process

873
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,120
which made the extraction process much

874
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,919
more intensive to get to that end

875
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:19,599
product as well so when you are using

876
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,679
when you're flushing you're actually

877
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:24,879
starting the degradation process of the

878
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:27,120
plant earlier and and in addition that

879
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,200
the plant needs nitrogen up to the point

880
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,918
uh to the end of flower to keep doing

881
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,880
the amino acid reactions to to produce

882
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,960
terpenes so they're there and the damage

883
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,039
that was created through using the wrong

884
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,440
nitrogens in the beginning it's already

885
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:43,278
been done you know it's like the

886
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,480
relatively the product is going to i

887
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:47,759
want to say the products are going to be

888
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,880
bad it's just the product the the plants

889
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:51,679
didn't

890
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,240
have the right nitrogens to produce the

891
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,798
right coams and reactions with the other

892
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,720
trace minerals and and not enough time

893
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:01,119
was there to produce those other terpene

894
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,278
profiles right so you're kind of hitting

895
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:06,079
on both sides you're hitting it on the

896
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:07,919
on the on the nitrogen forcing it to

897
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:09,519
grow which you're getting more

898
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,200
starches and more of that and then

899
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,038
you're also hitting it where the the

900
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,000
plant doesn't have the other trace

901
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:17,278
mineral coenzyme reaction time to to get

902
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,519
to the point where it's capable of

903
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:22,398
producing the higher terpene profiles

904
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,240
super interesting for sure so we'll go

905
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:27,439
into the next one so a lot of people go

906
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:30,240
right into the npk mpk no i'm going into

907
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,360
the the building blocks of the plant so

908
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,519
the next one is the benefits of sulfur

909
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,959
sulfur is another organic compound a lot

910
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,000
of people are just going to say this

911
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,278
stuff you'll see the stuff on the

912
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,398
intersect and right here we're going to

913
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:44,159
explain it so the amino acid uh format

914
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:45,918
it helps with amino acid formation so

915
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,240
we're talking about those five organic

916
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,880
compounds needed for

917
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,440
amino acids and for peptides and then

918
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,000
when do they become a protein is when

919
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,200
it attaches itself to the other minerals

920
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,159
and i'll show you this a little bit

921
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,080
later

922
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,600
so enzyme and vitamin development we

923
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:04,319
already talked about that law minimum

924
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,678
law of tolerance so i think this is also

925
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,599
a big marketing thing everyone's saying

926
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,919
fulvic acid folic acid human gas and

927
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:11,839
human acid well fulvic and humidity acid

928
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,360
are normally composed of amino acids

929
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,918
bonded to sulfur

930
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:18,798
so that is getting behind the veil you

931
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:21,278
know so don't go don't get caught up and

932
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:22,240
and and where where this plays a part is

933
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:23,519
where

934
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,919
they

935
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,359
ex where where they got their raw

936
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,200
materials and when they where they did

937
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,918
their extraction that's where it makes a

938
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,798
good humanic or fulvic acid product is

939
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,880
where their their initial raw material

940
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,398
is is starting and their extraction

941
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,720
process so

942
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:43,359
sulfur helps complete incomplete in

943
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,798
incomplete chemical reactions uh whether

944
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:50,158
by nature so using meals like bone meal

945
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:51,359
blood meal or a synthetic chemical so if

946
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,039
you are

947
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:54,798
this this is where again if you have

948
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:57,038
growing outdoors and you amend your your

949
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:59,679
soil with a little bit of sulfur and

950
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:01,919
you're using a man-made

951
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,360
nitrate that sulfur is actually going to

952
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,759
help with the chemical reaction to

953
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:08,878
revert it back to a natural natural

954
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:11,918
nitrogen it just takes time and and time

955
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:14,480
is with short crops is is not good

956
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:17,679
sulfur lowers the ph and so uh

957
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,838
in soil so tip here if people are on

958
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,838
well water and well water for some

959
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:23,519
reason always has a lot of sodium or

960
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,440
anyone that is tapping into water with

961
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,039
high amounts of sodium throwing sulfur

962
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,599
in your soil it's going to help regulate

963
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:31,679
your ph sulfur is needed in seed

964
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,639
production and photosynthesis a

965
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,079
photosynthesis for the nitrogen fixation

966
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,399
right so this is now where it's getting

967
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:41,119
a little more complicated or complex in

968
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:43,358
the whole chemical reaction part this

969
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,000
comes into play when you balance the

970
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:48,480
sulfur and nitric acid equation

971
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,800
you end up needing a lot of nitric acid

972
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,599
to balance one molecule of sulfur

973
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:58,240
during this balancing the bacteria have

974
00:34:53,599 --> 00:35:01,680
time to convert it from ammonia in h3 to

975
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,479
ammonium nitrogen in h4 plus

976
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:05,440
so

977
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,400
the amount of time it takes for

978
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,119
the nitric acid to become stable is the

979
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,480
same amount of time it takes for

980
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,559
your

981
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,639
bacteria to con to convert it so

982
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,279
a tip here this is where mycorrhizae

983
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:23,759
fungi are beneficial in soil to increase

984
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,960
sulfur sulfur content because fungi

985
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,800
holds onto sulfur waiting for rain that

986
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,519
is why you will see mushrooms right

987
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,440
after rain and is why your fungi colony

988
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:35,599
is so important it's a semi-mobile

989
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,679
nutrient so we'll look to the newer

990
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,920
later older growth

991
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,838
again go to the go to the presentation

992
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,320
you're going to see pictures that it's

993
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,719
almost impossible for me to describe uh

994
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,760
although you're the it's it's the lime

995
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:50,959
green is just so clear when you see it

996
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,960
um

997
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,199
that it's it's just going to pop out at

998
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,480
you so go to the slide

999
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,480
and check out the pictures it's one of

1000
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,800
the best ways i can recommend to do so

1001
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,480
what do you think about it yeah and and

1002
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,119
you guys can thank susan for not

1003
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,358
allowing us to post the pictures on

1004
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,480
youtube she uh susan's the ceo of

1005
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:10,719
youtube

1006
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,320
it would get flagged and blah blah blah

1007
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:14,239
so yeah these pictures you have on the

1008
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,680
slide i mean pretty straightforward you

1009
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:17,838
see it on the newer growth there the

1010
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:20,239
yellowing it looks like it's coming from

1011
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:21,599
kind of like the the stem there

1012
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:22,959
upwards

1013
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,800
to the tips

1014
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,720
so you can clearly see yellow and then

1015
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,880
the green on the tips one more

1016
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:32,559
additional tall tale is

1017
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,280
there there are three deficiencies that

1018
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:36,880
have purple characteristics and sulfur

1019
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,320
is one of those purple character one of

1020
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,079
those deficiencies which creates a

1021
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,000
purple characteristic in the stems

1022
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,440
veining and the stems a lot of people

1023
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,800
don't notice it

1024
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,240
but it's one of those things where a lot

1025
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,320
of people like hey do i get a purple

1026
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:50,559
strain going yeah when they're actually

1027
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,720
running into a deficiency purple stems i

1028
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:54,480
mean that's that's a whole can of worms

1029
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:56,239
there i know there's so many different

1030
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,880
reasons why i heard nutrient balances

1031
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:01,358
was another reason for that um but i

1032
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,800
haven't heard that sulfur in particular

1033
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:04,400
which that that's pretty interesting

1034
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,760
well you just said it right there a

1035
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,559
nutrient imbalance right and sulfur is a

1036
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,960
does

1037
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:13,838
compound uh organic compounds

1038
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,960
amino acids and peptides to create uh

1039
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:19,279
proteins which are later used

1040
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,559
also cold temps is another thing if

1041
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,640
i know when i

1042
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:25,119
pull temps or if you like water the

1043
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:27,759
plant with cold water like under i want

1044
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,838
to say like roughly 65 degrees

1045
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,440
fahrenheit or lower than that like

1046
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,119
overnight like the next day you can see

1047
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,880
like it's not just like a straight up

1048
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,720
purple stem the entire stem but it's

1049
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,200
kind of like streaks you'll see streaks

1050
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:41,759
of purple so if you see the streaking at

1051
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:44,639
all you can probably contribute to the

1052
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,480
low temps or low water temp giving you

1053
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:48,000
to it so figure that's worth mentioning

1054
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,280
they're actually causing a plant

1055
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,800
deficiency in that moment and um and

1056
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,280
i'll explain that in one of the other

1057
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,960
deficiency slides okay yeah it's really

1058
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,040
funny you know when you i i was caught

1059
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,639
up in the same thing right it's like oh

1060
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:02,639
throw on the ice and i'm and then i'm

1061
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:05,199
thinking like well we're growing way too

1062
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:07,279
big i cannot recommend all my growers do

1063
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,960
to to get all this ice and put on the

1064
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,040
plants this is does not make sense and

1065
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,119
then you start digging into the thought

1066
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,039
process behind it and you're like oh

1067
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,838
actually i'm creating a plant deficiency

1068
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:19,920
right here and it goes into in

1069
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:22,960
we'll go into another few minutes um

1070
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,838
benefits of phosphorus so phosphorus

1071
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,960
root growth flowering and seeds seeding

1072
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:29,519
why

1073
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:34,000
so photosynthesis collects the sun and

1074
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:36,559
carbon dioxide to produce atp right so

1075
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,599
adenosine triphosphate

1076
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:42,639
plus oxygen atp will attach itself to

1077
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,559
three phosphate groups to become a sugar

1078
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:46,719
so right now we're talking about amino

1079
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:49,679
acids peptides proteins and this is when

1080
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:54,598
it becomes in my viewpoint a protein

1081
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:54,598
so that science is a c10h16n5o13p3

1082
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,400
and this is a coenzyme reaction people

1083
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,240
might argue with me

1084
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,559
on when i'm using this terminology

1085
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,598
properly again i didn't go i didn't read

1086
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:06,719
the books

1087
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,760
i've

1088
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,799
at all

1089
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,640
i just i get curious and i start reading

1090
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,039
lots of different people's perspectives

1091
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:16,719
and then after you read thousands of

1092
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,599
words you kind of formulate your own

1093
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:22,480
thought process to it in a sense so

1094
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:25,359
plants release the o2 and store

1095
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,599
the energy in the form of sugars glucose

1096
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:30,400
in the root system which later be

1097
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,559
combined with amino acids to become aka

1098
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,720
exodites so that's another

1099
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,480
um terminology in the industry that i

1100
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:37,598
think a lot of people use

1101
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,119
although

1102
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,000
it's not really understood the

1103
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,680
connection right between photosynthesis

1104
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,760
and when it becomes exciting that when

1105
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:48,639
it becomes exadite is when that sugar

1106
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,560
attach yourselves to other amino acids

1107
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:52,960
which again become an exodite which

1108
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:55,599
stimulates root growth and bacteria and

1109
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,000
fungi development and it stores the

1110
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,838
energy in the roots for night uh for

1111
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,559
nighttime growth obviously nighttime

1112
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:04,639
growth is optimal for plants to grow and

1113
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:07,039
and roots are the storage the battery

1114
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:09,039
for them in my my how i look at it

1115
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,039
photosynthesis gets shut down

1116
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:14,000
dramatically without phosphorus and we

1117
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:16,079
explained why why atp and the

1118
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,159
triphosphate groups and all that so

1119
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,599
deficiencies phosphorus is actually

1120
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,480
another one

1121
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,318
that has purple characteristics

1122
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,240
different from magnesium and sulfur so

1123
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:28,239
those are the other three phosphorus

1124
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:30,639
magnesium and sulfur have purple

1125
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:33,439
characteristics and deficiencies

1126
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:35,679
purple pigments in the leaves mixed with

1127
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,760
with the green any time prior to the two

1128
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:39,440
weeks of harvest this is like everything

1129
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,640
is obviously i'm saying is not like

1130
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,119
keystone these are these things where in

1131
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:47,440
in my years of growing and grow coaching

1132
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,160
i had to be able to go into a room very

1133
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,679
quickly and identify the problem and get

1134
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,000
out because i had to go to the next

1135
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:56,000
operation to identify their problems and

1136
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,679
go on and on so

1137
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,358
i had to be able to see certain things

1138
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:01,358
and and this was one thing so whenever i

1139
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:03,279
see purple pigmentation two weeks from

1140
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:05,598
harvest i was like this is too early for

1141
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,000
autumn autumn situation to happened so i

1142
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,079
would i would start to be like okay this

1143
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
is this is kind of a

1144
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,920
a towel that lets me

1145
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,480
depict what type of a deficiency i'm

1146
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,838
having this is caused by accumulation of

1147
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,760
sugars that produce

1148
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:23,279
anthocyanin uh followed by necro

1149
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,119
necrosis of the leaves similar to

1150
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,319
calcium deficiency although five times

1151
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,240
worse it's a mobile nutrient so where do

1152
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:32,239
you want to look for a mobile nutrient

1153
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:33,759
bottom of the plant right older older of

1154
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,358
the leaves older the leaves exactly

1155
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,920
great job i'm trying i'm trying to you

1156
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:40,000
know and if as i go through this i

1157
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,480
encourage you to pause the video and

1158
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,880
before i answer it put your answer in be

1159
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,960
like i think it's this you know and and

1160
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,800
and just go along with it just just who

1161
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,119
cares if you're wrong

1162
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,880
so phosphorus go ahead i was gonna say i

1163
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,480
know with phosphorus deficiency i've

1164
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,400
come across this multiple times it would

1165
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,838
use the fox farm nutrient line up for

1166
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,838
example and

1167
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:01,599
and their lineup i know there's some

1168
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:02,960
nutrient lineups that they come with

1169
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,160
excess phosphorus and there's soil

1170
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,679
scientists that say hey some of these

1171
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:07,118
bottled lines they have excess

1172
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,118
phosphorus in it and it's going to lock

1173
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,720
it out in reality that nutrient formula

1174
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,800
probably should just be changed so it

1175
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:15,199
has less phosphorus so it doesn't lock

1176
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,880
out for example or maybe maybe i'm wrong

1177
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,960
maybe it wasn't an excess of phosphorus

1178
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,039
that locked it out but maybe it was not

1179
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,400
enough phosphorus and also i know that

1180
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,759
there's some nutrients i don't have them

1181
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,000
memorized but there's some nutrients

1182
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,599
that lock out other nutrients

1183
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,960
if there's an excess of them i'm not

1184
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,359
sure if you cover that in this

1185
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,480
presentation i don't have them memorized

1186
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:34,078
i have a couple of them memorized but

1187
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,719
not a lot of them but i know phosphorus

1188
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,880
can get locked out due to excess of

1189
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:40,000
other nutrients as well well we're going

1190
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,000
back to that

1191
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,318
the first two laws law minimum and law

1192
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,599
of tolerance right there yeah i don't i

1193
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:47,279
straight up guys i don't know all this

1194
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,119
stuff i have to go back to my references

1195
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,680
this is why i make notes like this so i

1196
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,680
don't have to remember i nowadays don't

1197
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:56,000
have the best memory probably because of

1198
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,838
the medicine whatever but

1199
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,920
but that's why i take really diligent

1200
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:02,239
notes so i can go back share it with

1201
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,559
someone else and they can they and we

1202
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:06,159
have the confidence together that

1203
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,400
that we're solving the problem together

1204
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:10,159
and we we we can reference it in in

1205
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,559
other ways because that's that's the the

1206
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:14,799
situation with growing right is you have

1207
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,639
a certain amount of time to do your best

1208
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,318
to bring in that crop so it doesn't

1209
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:19,920
matter about being the guy it matters

1210
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:22,239
about some of the problem and bringing

1211
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,280
in the harvest because some farms they

1212
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:27,679
have a lot of micro micro economics

1213
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,280
around them with with employees and

1214
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,358
taxes and all that other stuff so it's

1215
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,680
important that that crop comes in on

1216
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:35,358
time and in line with your values great

1217
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:37,759
point the

1218
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:38,639
so this is the purple pigmentation right

1219
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,880
and

1220
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:43,598
that everyone's seen it it's it's so

1221
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,838
clear and it looks like autumn it looks

1222
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:49,359
like on but it's not and you and you

1223
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:52,078
you'll notice it benefits a potassium

1224
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:53,199
so aids in photosynthesis and food

1225
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,119
formation

1226
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:57,039
helps convert sugars into starches so

1227
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,880
this is also another big thing so we we

1228
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:00,880
talked about nitric acid plant takes it

1229
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,400
up a little bit there then we talked

1230
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,960
about the amino acids and we talked

1231
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,559
about it converting into atp and sugar

1232
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,240
but the plant actually only can use a

1233
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,719
little bit of that sugar it actually has

1234
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:11,838
to convert it into starches for later

1235
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,480
use and we're talking about the

1236
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:16,239
batteries in a sense so the starches are

1237
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,199
stored in the root system for long-term

1238
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:19,519
use

1239
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:22,318
increases root growth and improves

1240
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:24,559
drought tolerance by building cellulose

1241
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:26,480
and reducing weak stem so when you put

1242
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:29,358
your hands on the on the plant that's

1243
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,480
cellulose okay and so so just like

1244
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:32,480
anything

1245
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,960
think about going over to the beach with

1246
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,358
a really thin cooler

1247
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,639
right you have a very thin cooler well

1248
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:40,159
all the ice is going to melt fairly

1249
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:43,118
quickly but you have a really nice

1250
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:44,639
cooler that has a great insulation layer

1251
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,240
well your ice is going to be in there

1252
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:48,400
just about all day long

1253
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:50,159
and you'll be able to feel you know

1254
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,838
refreshed throughout the whole day and

1255
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:53,679
that's the same thing with this plant by

1256
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:55,358
building that dirt uh by the building

1257
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:56,960
that building up the cellulose the

1258
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:59,759
plant's able to

1259
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,480
not evaporate as much as much water away

1260
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,240
on hot days it maintains turbo pressure

1261
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,920
reduces water loss and wilting so

1262
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:08,799
trigger pressure is the pressure of the

1263
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,440
water within the cells and

1264
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,119
yeah so more water pressure and you know

1265
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,880
it's going to fill up it's going to stay

1266
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,358
in there versus once again being

1267
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,599
evaporated away it increases protein

1268
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:22,000
content of plants which are

1269
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:25,760
organic compounds amino acids bonded

1270
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,719
with minerals in water okay so with more

1271
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:31,440
turgor pressure and and less uh water

1272
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:33,358
being evaporated away the plants are the

1273
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,000
the plants are going to have more time

1274
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:38,078
for other coenzyme reactions right but

1275
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,358
the plants constantly having to refill

1276
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,960
up its tank

1277
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:42,480
well it doesn't have enough it doesn't

1278
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,880
have enough time to do more coherence

1279
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,599
and reactions so this is that that that

1280
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,920
process where that's what photos nasa

1281
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,920
helps do this is why water the water

1282
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,880
system is the blood transportation

1283
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,838
system for more coenzyme production and

1284
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,880
it's how potassium aids in activating at

1285
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,559
least 60 other coenzymes being produced

1286
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,640
so we go back to the law of minimum law

1287
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:06,318
of tolerance that chart where you see

1288
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:08,960
all the minerals working together right

1289
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:11,119
well when you have water and time you

1290
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,519
have time for that co-amazon reaction to

1291
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,119
happen with more chromosome reactions

1292
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:17,199
happening

1293
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,519
the plant's able to achieve its true

1294
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:21,838
potential helps stop the spread of crop

1295
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:24,079
disease and nematodes while nematodes

1296
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:26,078
come because of stagnated water right so

1297
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,839
if you have more water retention and you

1298
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,359
have more minerals in the water the

1299
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:31,599
water is going to stay healthy and just

1300
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:34,239
going to be able to fight off disease

1301
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,440
potassium is a mobile nutrient so where

1302
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,519
are you going to look for the mobile

1303
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,960
nutrient

1304
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:43,039
older leaves all right i love it okay so

1305
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,480
i won't keep doing that to you i just

1306
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:45,838
paused for a minute so the audience

1307
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,079
could think about it oh okay i'll keep

1308
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:50,480
doing it then i'll keep doing it then um

1309
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,880
okay so the next one potassium oh this

1310
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,800
is just so clear again we've seen this

1311
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,880
so often it

1312
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,519
kerosis starts on the upper half of the

1313
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,599
leaf i it it is it happens over and over

1314
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:03,119
and over and and all i want to do is

1315
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,559
just take that one leaf off yeah like

1316
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,160
get rid of that like i don't even want

1317
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:08,239
to see that def i don't even want to see

1318
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:10,879
that why is that one leaf dying right

1319
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:12,159
but it's it's showing me signs of what

1320
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,760
the rest of the crops going to grow

1321
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:15,920
through and if i pay attention to that

1322
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,280
one leaf i'm going to be saving myself

1323
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,880
through deficiencies later through a

1324
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,319
crop everyone's seen it go to the

1325
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,760
presentation and see it once you see it

1326
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:23,599
you're going to be like oh wow i have

1327
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,440
probably have a potassium deficiency in

1328
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,039
my in my grow room right now one thing i

1329
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,119
do want to mention that relates to

1330
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:30,960
potassium is it's

1331
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,079
potassium one thing i do know is is we

1332
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,119
talked about the relationship of

1333
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,720
nutrients potassium and calcium are

1334
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,160
antagonistic

1335
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:39,759
and basically what that means in

1336
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:41,039
simplified terms is they kind of work

1337
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,319
against each other in a way i guess

1338
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:43,519
that's the easiest way i can i can

1339
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:46,000
explain it

1340
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:48,559
and a scenario happens somebody post on

1341
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,239
my forum mr growth.com forum if you

1342
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,280
wanna ever wanna post pictures you grow

1343
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:53,838
you have questions or whatever you can

1344
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,119
head over there they had a calcium

1345
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:56,799
deficiency

1346
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,400
and one thing i had mentioned is hey

1347
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,440
what part of he was in late flowering

1348
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,960
and he started getting calcium

1349
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,720
deficiency and i asked him what his

1350
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,119
nutrient regimen was and he was loading

1351
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:07,439
and he was pumping in a pk booster right

1352
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:10,318
so phosphorus potassium so he actually

1353
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,000
had an excess of potassium that caused

1354
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:13,679
calcium deficiency

1355
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,838
so that was super because he was he was

1356
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:17,358
feeding calmag normally like he would

1357
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:19,440
he's like why do i have a why do i have

1358
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:22,239
a calcium deficiency if i'm feeding it

1359
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,760
in it was because he had excess of

1360
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:25,439
potassium so i thought that was worth

1361
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,040
mentioning at this point

1362
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,880
and write what you just said there too i

1363
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:30,800
won't dive too much into it but that is

1364
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,800
a question and something that brings is

1365
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,559
brought up in the topics is like a lot

1366
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,400
of people like oh should i not use

1367
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,440
calcium magnesium uh toward the end of

1368
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,079
flowering

1369
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,720
right and so

1370
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,079
to each is their own and mpk and that's

1371
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:46,318
what we're discussing right the k and

1372
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,359
the k is known for flowering and so

1373
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:50,000
right there you're just saying the

1374
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:52,558
potassium and the calcium are contradict

1375
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,599
contraindicated in a sense at times so

1376
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:58,079
and when is calcium used right calcium

1377
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,519
is used what is calcium out we have we

1378
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,839
didn't get into it but calcium is an

1379
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:04,239
immobile nutrient so it's used in the

1380
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:06,719
initial construction of the plant so as

1381
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:08,558
you get into the flowering process why

1382
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:10,399
do you need to construct more of the

1383
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,599
plant at that point you need to allow

1384
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:16,960
that that the other coenzymes to to take

1385
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:19,119
place because at this point the immobile

1386
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,838
nutrients you need other immobile

1387
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:23,760
nutrients to start to start um doing

1388
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:25,759
their job in the plant not the calcium

1389
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,040
in a sense i was gonna say i wasn't

1390
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,359
gonna get into it but then we got into

1391
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:33,039
it so

1392
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:35,199
um magnesium i think magnesium is i love

1393
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:36,880
this topic i think this is one is where

1394
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:39,039
it was when i when i finally got my head

1395
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,838
around i was like

1396
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:45,119
right it was just like okay i get it i

1397
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:47,838
understand um so chlorophyll reduction

1398
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,680
in the green blood okay so chlorophyll

1399
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:51,440
production is the green blood of the

1400
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:53,598
plant i always like to use certain

1401
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,079
terminology that hopefully creates a a

1402
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:58,400
connection to your soul in a sense right

1403
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,519
so you have red red blood and then you

1404
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,000
have green blood and that's the

1405
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:04,079
chlorophyll so hopefully you you you

1406
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,559
have a deeper connection in a sense

1407
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:09,359
magnesium gives the green color

1408
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,680
so the the center of the chlorophyll

1409
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:13,838
molecule is magnesium

1410
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:17,279
so let's jump over to the

1411
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:20,159
uh to the magnesium molecule so we have

1412
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:23,280
55 carbons so that's an organic compound

1413
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:25,679
72 hydrogens another garnet compound

1414
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:29,680
four nitrogens another organic compound

1415
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:32,239
five oxygens and then one magnesium i'm

1416
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:33,759
just blown away by that right just one

1417
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:36,399
one molecule

1418
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,720
it turns the ether into reality where

1419
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,119
you can touch it and i i'm fascinated

1420
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:44,000
with that okay and and

1421
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,838
uh so anyways so so phosphorus mobility

1422
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,079
so it talks about phosphorus mobility we

1423
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:48,960
already talked about atp so this is also

1424
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,640
where

1425
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,240
an iron utilization we're going to get

1426
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:54,159
into that seconds but

1427
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:55,519
phosphorus mobility and iron utilization

1428
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:57,920
goes into the law of minimum law of

1429
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:59,920
tolerance again right where

1430
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,760
when magnesium is able to do its job

1431
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,318
with the chlorophyll the atp is able to

1432
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,240
do is its function and then again we'll

1433
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:08,400
get into iron a second fruiting and

1434
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:10,639
maturing so

1435
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,838
if you want to use a rock-based

1436
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:17,039
magnesium supplement uh look for ling

1437
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:18,239
lingtonite it's uh potassium sulfur and

1438
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:20,800
magnesium

1439
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:23,519
and look right this is how this is how

1440
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:26,000
these minerals are combined together in

1441
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,519
nature naturally that's where again i'm

1442
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,440
fascinated with that right you have

1443
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:31,679
these things in the in nature's like

1444
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,119
okay this is what you need use it and

1445
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:34,000
this is everything you need for this

1446
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,760
stage

1447
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,159
or you can use epsom salt which is

1448
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:41,599
magnesium sulfate both of these will

1449
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:43,598
actually still help uh help and

1450
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,400
they will not interfere with your

1451
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,359
microbiology okay if you get out and

1452
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,358
we're talking about the different

1453
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:51,679
chemical structures there's other

1454
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:53,759
chemical structures the magnesium that

1455
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,838
the chemical suppliers try to sell you

1456
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,839
so again look to the back of the bottle

1457
00:51:55,838 --> 00:51:59,838
and look uh look at what type of epson

1458
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:03,279
salt or magnesium is in there now and

1459
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:04,719
look at magnesium edta that's that's a

1460
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,760
new that's another chemical structure

1461
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:09,439
for an example so magnesium is a mobile

1462
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:13,040
nutrient so where are you going to look

1463
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:15,920
for the the deficiency

1464
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:19,039
older leaves i love it all right so it's

1465
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:22,480
pretty magnesium actually shows up in

1466
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:24,960
uh as a secondary deficiency quite often

1467
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,358
i and times it it was actually difficult

1468
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,440
to find a really great magnesium only

1469
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:31,119
deficiency but i was able to find one

1470
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,440
picture

1471
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,280
you know it normally will show up with a

1472
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,119
calcium deficiency or something and

1473
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,960
that's or a sulfur deficiency and that's

1474
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:41,440
why you'll have different products where

1475
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,599
it's a mag sulfur magnesium calcium

1476
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,000
product fused together the magnesium

1477
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,680
sulfate can be used as a foliar i don't

1478
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,920
think a lot of people know that so

1479
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:51,199
it'll kind of hit your plant faster in a

1480
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,358
sense if needed so if you are coming

1481
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:55,519
across a mag deficiency consider

1482
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:57,358
magnesium sulfate as a foliar feed

1483
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:59,599
absolutely i love that any

1484
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:00,880
you know that's where you get the we

1485
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,318
were talking about

1486
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,160
we were talking about earlier right what

1487
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:06,239
is the most unique thing about the

1488
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:09,039
canada industry right is the

1489
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:11,838
is that we have developed an inexpensive

1490
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:13,440
testing process to test the quality of

1491
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:14,799
this product and we

1492
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,559
are are

1493
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,800
take time to actually go back to the

1494
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,880
growers that are getting four percent

1495
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,880
terpenes on the plant and ask them what

1496
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,960
they did we're going to be able to

1497
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,800
identify you know their growing

1498
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,079
practices and how we should probably

1499
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,400
start to implement those growing

1500
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:32,960
practices into large-scale agriculture

1501
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,039
because the chirping profiles

1502
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,358
you only get to and i hate to use the

1503
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:38,880
word only but i'm going to and you can

1504
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:40,480
unsubscribe to my channel because i used

1505
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,480
it whatever but

1506
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,280
the only way you're going to get to the

1507
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,639
highest four percent terpenes and above

1508
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,359
that on the planet went through the

1509
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:50,879
testing is with all your microbiology

1510
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:52,318
going plain and simple that's my

1511
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,838
viewpoint i

1512
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:55,679
all the all the growers i've known that

1513
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:57,519
i've gotten into the top 10 on the on

1514
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:59,838
the on the testing on the

1515
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:01,199
on the different types of competitions

1516
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:02,880
out there when i've got an opportunity

1517
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:04,799
to talk to them they were all in the

1518
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,280
microbiology direction they weren't just

1519
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:10,559
in the chemist so okay so let's go ahead

1520
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:12,960
and get into iron iron is

1521
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:15,839
for chlorophyll formation because of

1522
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,679
ferrotoxins and fair toxins are iron

1523
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:20,400
sulfate protein

1524
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:22,799
a found or peptide whatever well this is

1525
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,639
iron right so we're now talking about it

1526
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,119
connected to a mineral and an organic

1527
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:29,838
compound so we want to call it a protein

1528
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:33,599
so iron sulfate protein found in the

1529
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:34,880
chloroplast the site of photosynthesis

1530
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,000
and you can look at the picture where

1531
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,960
i'm showing

1532
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,119
were is in the presentation ferrodoxins

1533
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:44,318
also play a role when balancing the

1534
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:46,798
nitrogen and the and reducing the sulfur

1535
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:49,039
so then in the nitrogen fixation and

1536
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:51,519
assimilation process is when iron and

1537
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:53,358
sulfur uh sulfur come together so we're

1538
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:56,480
a minimum law of tolerance again

1539
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:58,798
when balancing the equation and

1540
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,559
when balancing the equation it increases

1541
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:03,280
oxygen because when you balance the

1542
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:05,200
equation with sulfur and nitric acid the

1543
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,960
final math it and i won't get into the

1544
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:09,838
math but basically what it means is you

1545
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:12,318
have one sulfur six hydrogen six

1546
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:14,558
nitrogen and 18 oxygen molecules and

1547
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:16,960
that's why your oxygen content will

1548
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:18,240
increase when adding in iron so we're

1549
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,280
talking about a trace mineral so if

1550
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:23,279
you're making if you're making your your

1551
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,119
if you're using like the vortex uh

1552
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,960
thought process and you're agitating

1553
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,280
your wa or just putting a bubbler there

1554
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,798
and agitating your process well we're

1555
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:34,640
talking about the oxygen carrying

1556
00:55:30,798 --> 00:55:36,719
capability of your water even and so uh

1557
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:38,159
by having the proper trace minerals in

1558
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:40,000
your water which i'm always talking

1559
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:43,039
about a product called drops of balance

1560
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,280
it's an alk it's it has 34 plus trace

1561
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:47,599
minerals and it's the foundation of

1562
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,000
sulfur of how all the minerals are

1563
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,200
placed and makes it water soluble but

1564
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
going back to

1565
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:57,279
the slide cell division and growth is

1566
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,838
because of chlorophyll and this is why i

1567
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,319
consider iron the father and sulfur the

1568
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:04,719
mother is because you have cell division

1569
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:06,400
which is you know production and then

1570
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:09,199
you have growth which is the nurturing

1571
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:12,720
process this is how i'm able i try to

1572
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:15,039
remember the minerals and how i create a

1573
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:17,439
a healthier relationship with my plants

1574
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:18,960
and the you know the minerals that i'm

1575
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,679
using to feed my plants and then one day

1576
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:24,720
feed my body tip bone meal is a great

1577
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:27,598
source of nitrogen and iron for soil

1578
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:31,118
growing because the bone because the

1579
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:33,039
blood cells are the exact same chemical

1580
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:36,559
makeup of chlorophyll except the center

1581
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:39,759
molecule is iron so it's 55 carbons 72

1582
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:41,680
hydrogens four nitrogens five oxygens

1583
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,960
and one iron molecule and that's why

1584
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:46,399
bone meal

1585
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:48,720
has has iron supplement iron it comes up

1586
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,960
and shows up as a at times as a sulfur

1587
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:53,358
deficiency and it looks at it other how

1588
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,519
i would encourage you to look uh look is

1589
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:58,159
at the tips of the leaves you'll at

1590
00:56:55,519 --> 00:57:00,798
times you'll see green in between the

1591
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:02,480
yellowing as well and once again go to

1592
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:03,920
the powerpoint presentation you're going

1593
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,880
to see a really great example and you're

1594
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,720
going to see

1595
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,000
within the leaf there's spottiness right

1596
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:09,279
you're going to see some really nice

1597
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,280
green and then you're going to see the

1598
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:14,720
yellowing and it's not going to be like

1599
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:16,079
a nice flow of lime green um once again

1600
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:17,598
go to the go to it you'll see what i

1601
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,760
mean you see it you'll be able to

1602
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:21,760
identify it from that point on one thing

1603
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,440
to mention that i want to add

1604
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,880
particularly for new growers that don't

1605
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:29,519
know this is new growth is gonna start

1606
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,440
as yellow and it's gonna turn to green

1607
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:32,480
so oftentimes and i get this a lot with

1608
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,159
beginners

1609
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,838
they will their lights will just come on

1610
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,279
for the day and then they'll open up

1611
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:40,000
their tent and they'll look and they'll

1612
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:42,400
see oh i got a iron deficiency or i have

1613
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,599
a sulfur deficiency because it looks

1614
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,440
kind of similar to where there's

1615
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:47,039
yellowing starting at the base and then

1616
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,358
going up towards the tip so they think

1617
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:51,358
that they have some sort of deficiency

1618
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:53,598
when really like an hour or two hours

1619
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:55,838
later all of a sudden the leaf is green

1620
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:57,599
there so new growth like overnight for

1621
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:59,679
example when your lights are off it's

1622
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:02,160
not producing that chlorophyll to make

1623
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:04,798
the the leaves green and it just takes a

1624
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:06,719
couple hours for that to happen but if

1625
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:08,960
you just turn on your lights and you see

1626
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:10,879
what looks to be an iron deficiency just

1627
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,720
remember that new growth is starts out

1628
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:15,519
as yellow and it should turn to green

1629
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:16,879
within a couple hours or so and again we

1630
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:18,400
go we

1631
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,680
i love that you said that right it's

1632
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,798
because

1633
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:25,118
the plants growing faster than what

1634
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:26,798
than than what it can produce on other

1635
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,960
coenzyme production

1636
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:31,838
right so that's and because iron is a

1637
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:34,960
semi-mobile nutrient it's able to keep

1638
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:37,199
moving and keep to the newer growth as

1639
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,119
as as it grows and that's exactly what

1640
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:40,798
you're describing right here so i love

1641
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,920
it calcium

1642
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:44,318
calcium

1643
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,720
okay so benefits of calcium formation of

1644
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:49,199
cell wall and and cell membrane build

1645
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:50,879
soil structure when you use

1646
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:54,318
bill it builds soil structure when you

1647
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:56,960
use sea shells or bone meal uh see and

1648
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:58,960
just to elude uh give more

1649
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:02,159
marketing it's either sea shell you if

1650
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:04,720
you're using sea shells uh limestone

1651
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:07,039
diotination earth those are all the same

1652
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:08,719
exact thing okay chalk there's just

1653
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:10,400
different marketing names to settlement

1654
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:12,399
under different industries and yes

1655
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,000
there's some binders and different look

1656
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,920
to the process the how they're

1657
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,760
processing their their material that's

1658
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,519
that's the key to getting a great a

1659
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,839
great source of material of anything

1660
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:23,599
this feeds the microbes which holds the

1661
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:26,239
soil together

1662
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:28,400
calcium nitrate is a

1663
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:31,759
is a synthesized chemical that i

1664
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:35,119
actually would be fine using it's nho3

1665
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,319
and if you go back to the nitrogen um if

1666
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:38,640
you go back to and you see where it's

1667
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:41,279
dry from it is limestone derived from

1668
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:44,078
nitric acid okay so limestone i'm good

1669
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,960
with nitric acid is the is the acid in

1670
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:47,359
the

1671
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,679
natural nitrogen cycle so i would use

1672
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:51,519
calcium nitrate and there's actually a

1673
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:52,719
brands i'm going to recommend in this

1674
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:55,119
into this

1675
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:56,639
video that have been very thoughtful

1676
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:58,559
around this they even if they're using

1677
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:01,519
synthetic fertilizer they're actually

1678
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:04,160
using fertilizer only in the natural

1679
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:06,400
um pathway that microbiology converts

1680
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:10,239
their stuff into so give you another

1681
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:12,400
example calcium gluconate

1682
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:13,759
is a synthetized chemical will not feed

1683
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,880
microbes and in fact we'll shut them

1684
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,880
down

1685
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,559
so that calcium if you that type of

1686
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,400
calcium is actually in a number of

1687
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:22,160
bottles and that you that you buy on

1688
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,400
your shelf and i'm not going to slander

1689
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:27,759
slander some of the brands right now but

1690
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:31,119
um i want to so uh

1691
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:33,520
critical for activating certain enzymes

1692
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:35,838
law minimum law of tolerance tip use

1693
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:38,079
dolomite lime for soil to help prevent

1694
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:40,558
calcium deficiency

1695
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:41,519
calcium is an immobile nutrient so look

1696
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,119
to the

1697
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:45,679
newer leaves and to identify

1698
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:48,240
deficiencies in excess calcium we've all

1699
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:50,719
seen it it's it's yellow uh yellowish

1700
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:53,118
brown irregular spots uh and you're

1701
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:55,118
you're going to see it as a like again

1702
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:57,680
as the plant is growing you're right is

1703
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:59,358
because it's immobile nutrient it needs

1704
01:00:57,679 --> 01:01:01,118
that as

1705
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:03,199
the plant is growing and

1706
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:05,358
it needs it dramatically less later into

1707
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:08,719
flowering it's like what we talked about

1708
01:01:05,358 --> 01:01:10,960
earlier the thing with the calcium is it

1709
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:12,239
again it goes back to strong cell walls

1710
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,079
right

1711
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:15,199
if you come across calcium deficiency

1712
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:17,119
and flowering you're gonna get some

1713
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:18,639
floppage right you're gonna the plant's

1714
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:21,760
gonna be flopping over especially if

1715
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:23,598
it's got those big flowers on there uh i

1716
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,880
it's happened to me before and it's not

1717
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:29,039
fun oh excuse me it's not fun to uh try

1718
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,440
to get them up for support so calcium is

1719
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:33,519
super important uh just going along with

1720
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,679
what you're saying like i i grow coach

1721
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:38,079
clients literally all over the world

1722
01:01:35,679 --> 01:01:40,000
that they this is all they got this is

1723
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:41,280
all they you know it's for some reason

1724
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
this is what they buy and i don't want

1725
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:45,359
them to go buy more stuff and i and when

1726
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,880
i look to the back of the balls and look

1727
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:48,960
at the the nitrogen they're using

1728
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,960
whether it's your urea or whatever this

1729
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,358
is when i would highly encourage them to

1730
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,318
make sure to be adding in the calcium

1731
01:01:53,358 --> 01:01:56,400
because that plant is going to be

1732
01:01:54,318 --> 01:01:59,279
growing quickly and they need the other

1733
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,720
fertilizers to to do those other

1734
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,319
functions that they're growing or like

1735
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:04,558
we said they're going to get weak stems

1736
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:06,079
or whatever so as i'm as in grow

1737
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:07,599
coaching people it doesn't matter really

1738
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,480
what they're how they're growing i

1739
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:10,400
always encourage them to go to the

1740
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,960
microbiology direction but they don't

1741
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:15,280
i'm also tailoring them on their base

1742
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,760
nutrients how they're growing and other

1743
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:20,079
additives to use at certain times for

1744
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,240
very specific reasons on on because of

1745
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:25,200
the chemicals they're using great point

1746
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:27,519
so benefits of magnesium and this this

1747
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:29,679
is where i i get incredibly fascinated

1748
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:31,679
right so as i go through these slides

1749
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:34,480
you're going to see that the enzyme

1750
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:36,318
coenzyme reactions start increasing more

1751
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,280
and more and more but

1752
01:02:36,318 --> 01:02:39,599
it's

1753
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,760
manganese what it's like how much

1754
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:44,720
manganese do we use and why why is it

1755
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,480
responsible for over 300 enzyme coenzyme

1756
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,838
reactions

1757
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,079
why are we not making it more

1758
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:52,078
significant right and this is again how

1759
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:54,318
we get to the the higher health or

1760
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:56,960
potential of these plants is because as

1761
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:59,119
we get more into the trace minerals like

1762
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:02,079
all the foundation of the plant if you

1763
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:04,400
notice it is is created for is to

1764
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:07,039
transport the trace minerals so why are

1765
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:09,119
we not putting more energy into what the

1766
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:12,079
plant is actually asking for almost the

1767
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:14,160
entire time so magnesium manganese aids

1768
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:16,480
in more than 300 enzymes

1769
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:18,639
that regulate the human body and plants

1770
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:21,119
law minimum of tolerance without

1771
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:23,679
manganese chlorophyll cannot capture

1772
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:25,519
sun energy for photosynthesis

1773
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:28,000
capturing light

1774
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:31,599
what is light light is harmonic

1775
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:34,000
frequencies so magnesium is the receiver

1776
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:37,200
so plants are listening to music all day

1777
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,079
long proof plants like music just a

1778
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:43,199
correction manganese you said manganese

1779
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:46,480
oh thank you i i do that all the time i

1780
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:49,118
always switch these stupid yeah

1781
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:51,679
if i do that again we are on manganese

1782
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:54,720
not magnesium

1783
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:57,038
plants uh interpret the music they are

1784
01:03:54,719 --> 01:04:00,480
listening to by the trace minerals

1785
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:03,680
activated with co-enzymes designed with

1786
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,719
the dna rna code that are stored in the

1787
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:06,159
leaves

1788
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:07,838
now i'm going to repeat this one more

1789
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:10,318
time because i think this is so

1790
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:11,679
incredibly important you know light

1791
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:14,159
light when light hits the leaves it

1792
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:16,000
creates a prism right and and when it

1793
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:19,038
reflects off what is that harmonic

1794
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,838
frequency and and and minerals are

1795
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:23,680
minerals are gemstones they are they are

1796
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:25,440
they are the prism that the light

1797
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:26,399
reflects through and if your plant

1798
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,559
doesn't have

1799
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,480
all the trace minerals that are you're

1800
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:33,119
capable of providing to the plant that

1801
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:35,199
prism is going to be isn't isn't going

1802
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:37,599
to be a full spectrum in my viewpoint

1803
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:39,118
and the ana and and the

1804
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:40,880
the light intensity and all the

1805
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:43,440
different types of light that come off

1806
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:46,559
the sun is crazy intense like we only

1807
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:48,480
see this like tiny tiny little little

1808
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:50,720
speck of spectrum of that that we can

1809
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,679
see when blight when when the sun is

1810
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:54,558
actually like

1811
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:56,558
uh let me go back it's like that big you

1812
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:58,160
know what i mean and

1813
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,720
and we only see this little about a

1814
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:02,480
little mount and so i'm always thinking

1815
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:05,358
you know with all these trace minerals

1816
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:07,280
is the is is the plant capable of

1817
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:09,199
capturing all these other a number of

1818
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,440
other light spectrums that

1819
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:14,639
that the sun emits because the sun

1820
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:16,000
wouldn't emit those those spectrums onto

1821
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:17,759
our earth

1822
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,199
if it wasn't for a purpose you know i'm

1823
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,480
not trying to get in religion or in that

1824
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:22,000
stuff but i do

1825
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:23,199
in some level think that we're in this

1826
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,239
divine

1827
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,759
system that is created for us and

1828
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:30,719
everything has a purpose and every

1829
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:33,760
single time someone tries to to dismiss

1830
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:35,919
us or dismiss our our reason for being

1831
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,839
as just being random i don't even want

1832
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,639
to talk to that person

1833
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:39,679
so

1834
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:41,440
whatever

1835
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:42,558
um not whatever but you know my point

1836
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,039
moving on

1837
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:47,119
i i wonder what phosphorus and this is

1838
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:48,720
my point to this right is i wonder what

1839
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,280
phosphorus and calcium sound like to

1840
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:53,919
microbes trace minerals actually play a

1841
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,839
larger role when uh when we are

1842
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,200
than what we are led to believe

1843
01:05:55,838 --> 01:05:59,119
i don't know if you've ever talked about

1844
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:01,598
a moto's work on water and holding

1845
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:05,039
energy no i haven't the modus work on

1846
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:08,160
water is all about capturing the energy

1847
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:10,880
that that we emit off of our bodies when

1848
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:12,639
we're saying love or we're saying hate

1849
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,559
and the energy and the water actually

1850
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:17,358
has the ability to capture that energy

1851
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:19,680
and what he does is he he he says this

1852
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:21,519
words or he plays certain music right

1853
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:22,960
when the water is going to the freezing

1854
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,358
point and then he looks at the water

1855
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:28,480
underneath the microscope and he's shown

1856
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:31,119
over the last two decades all the the

1857
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,760
different uh crystalline structures that

1858
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:36,798
the water forms through different energy

1859
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:39,760
we emit off of it and not to go too far

1860
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:42,719
into his uh to our ancient history

1861
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:45,280
um but you know the waterways in india

1862
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:46,639
all throughout the world actually uh in

1863
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,079
the strong structures where they're

1864
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:50,400
having water going through all these

1865
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:52,079
pathways a lot of these angel structures

1866
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,000
actually have words like love or

1867
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:55,599
appreciation going through their

1868
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
waterways which

1869
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:59,039
is very interesting to me

1870
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,039
so

1871
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:02,799
minerals are electrons protons and

1872
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,240
neutrons can we admit that can we agree

1873
01:07:02,798 --> 01:07:06,960
to that yep

1874
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:09,838
okay so buddha said we can experience

1875
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:12,159
108 human characteristics

1876
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:15,920
characteristics being emotions

1877
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:17,838
emotions are energy my hypothesis is

1878
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:20,240
that there is one mineral associated

1879
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:22,639
with every human emotion we're capable

1880
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:25,118
of interpreting on this human plane so

1881
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:29,759
my theory is that there is a 108 total

1882
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:31,440
or organic compound slash minerals

1883
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,039
and our

1884
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,798
and as our technology gets more

1885
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,160
sensitive we'll be able to discover them

1886
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:38,318
and right now we're roughly around the

1887
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:40,879
90 range

1888
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:43,679
so going back to manganese so manganese

1889
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:46,798
is an immobile nutrient so look to the

1890
01:07:43,679 --> 01:07:48,798
newer leaves for deficiencies in excess

1891
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:51,440
and manganese one of the best ways i

1892
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:52,639
think it is it very often i think people

1893
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:55,119
will be like oh i'm dealing with the

1894
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:58,480
calcium deficiency but the

1895
01:07:55,119 --> 01:08:00,000
the it's different like the spots appear

1896
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,318
different on the leaf than a calcium

1897
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,400
deficiency in my viewpoint it's just

1898
01:08:02,318 --> 01:08:05,679
it's just a slight

1899
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,639
i don't know it's just slightly

1900
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:08,159
different and when you look at the

1901
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:10,318
picture you're gonna see exactly what i

1902
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:12,558
mean and you're like oh yeah i noticed

1903
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:14,318
that i know exactly what it is it's

1904
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:16,640
definitely mistaken a lot for calcium

1905
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:18,399
deficiency that is for sure i've come

1906
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,880
across manganese deficiency just a small

1907
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:22,158
handful of times to be honest

1908
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:25,359
one time in particular that i can

1909
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:27,759
remember as being cocoa and my ph was a

1910
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:29,838
little bit too high and you know we have

1911
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,439
those ph ranges where nutrients are

1912
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:33,920
uptaken at different ph ranges and it

1913
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:36,318
was just out of that range and so i saw

1914
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:38,560
a manganese deficiency so yeah this

1915
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:40,000
picture i think is pretty good you can

1916
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,600
definitely looking at this you can kind

1917
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,079
of see that there is a clear difference

1918
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,520
between this and calcium deficiency

1919
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:47,198
because uh yeah there's like a little

1920
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,520
bit of yellowing in there as well right

1921
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:51,599
mm-hmm and in just what you're saying

1922
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,279
also i've actually noticed my uh this

1923
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,960
deficiently come up more when using the

1924
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:55,679
fox farmland i don't mean to slander it

1925
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,838
but

1926
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:00,079
again i grow coach i this this line is

1927
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:02,238
around the world i've made at least 30

1928
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:04,640
videos on fox farm and you can read all

1929
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:06,238
the all the threads i got a couple

1930
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:10,000
growers that wanted to use up their

1931
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:11,678
nutrients ran into this issue so um that

1932
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,600
being said let's move on all right

1933
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:14,719
moving on to the next one which is

1934
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,039
copper

1935
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:19,198
benefits of copper so copper is a

1936
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:21,198
metabolic catalyst and so it actually

1937
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:24,079
helps speed things up because that's all

1938
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:26,318
a catalyst is so it helps the catalyst

1939
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:28,798
of photosynthesis and the respiratory

1940
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:30,239
and that is why it increases sugars

1941
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:32,960
i think this is where a lot of the

1942
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:35,838
industry thinks that sugars

1943
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:37,439
is in part it is part of it but they

1944
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:39,519
think that they they they want to

1945
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,960
provide sugars to increase the taste and

1946
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,640
that's actually

1947
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,560
not how you increase the taste when you

1948
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,640
and when you add in more cane sugar and

1949
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:49,199
other stuff you you're you're jacking up

1950
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,520
your your your bacterias and you're

1951
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:53,278
showing your down your your fungi and

1952
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,520
that's also goes back into the lawn

1953
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:58,159
mower tolerance this is actually how i

1954
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:59,679
actually know if the nutrient line knows

1955
01:09:58,158 --> 01:10:01,839
what they're doing is when they're

1956
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:03,440
increa when that when i see them saying

1957
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,960
higher higher terps or something like

1958
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:07,039
that and i turn to back a ball and they

1959
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,319
have copper in there i'm like okay this

1960
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:11,279
nutrient line kind of knows what they're

1961
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:13,119
talking about because copper aids in in

1962
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:15,359
enzyme production all bacterias are

1963
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:17,359
capable of producing different coenzymes

1964
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:20,158
for every mineral that exists in the

1965
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:21,599
soil so you have billions of bacterias

1966
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:22,960
millions of fungi and all those

1967
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,600
bacterias can produce different

1968
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:28,719
coenzymes what do copper enzymes do they

1969
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:32,079
intensify color why because with more

1970
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:33,840
minerals that become bioavailable more

1971
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:37,119
of the music can be interpreted by the

1972
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:39,840
plant involves improves flavor flavor

1973
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:41,679
equals terpenes because with these

1974
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:44,400
these specific cone designs your plant

1975
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:47,279
can now produce a higher terpene profile

1976
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:48,719
copper is a semi mobile nutrient so it's

1977
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:51,119
going to appear in the newer before the

1978
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:52,399
older and it's very distinguishable look

1979
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:53,359
at the picture

1980
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:55,679
i mean

1981
01:10:53,359 --> 01:10:58,479
you'll know you'll know what i mean and

1982
01:10:55,679 --> 01:11:00,399
this and this picture you they're even

1983
01:10:58,479 --> 01:11:03,198
going through a nitrogen deficiency with

1984
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:05,279
it in my opinion because of how fake the

1985
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:06,799
green is and even when you look at the

1986
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:08,719
the flower development it is

1987
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,719
underdeveloped and

1988
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:13,198
and when and i'm probably looking at a

1989
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:15,840
seven weaker right there yeah probably

1990
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:16,960
nitrogen toxicity nitrogen toxicity

1991
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,480
thank you okay

1992
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,760
nitrogen deficiency yeah nitrogen

1993
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:22,399
toxicity like you mentioned before the

1994
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,840
dark green leaves i see that as well and

1995
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:27,119
then you can see the outer edges

1996
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:29,039
yellowing to the chlorosis there so yeah

1997
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:31,840
exactly so we didn't cover all of the

1998
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:33,119
essential nutrients here in this video i

1999
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,079
definitely want to save it for a part

2000
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:36,158
two

2001
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:38,479
if the audience demands it if you demand

2002
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:40,719
a part two audience uh we'd love to have

2003
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:42,399
you comment in the

2004
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,719
comment section below let us know you

2005
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:46,158
want a part two because we've i think a

2006
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:48,560
little bit less than half the amount of

2007
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:51,519
the sensory nutrients we covered today

2008
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:53,760
so we have we could really do a part two

2009
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,840
and cover potentially the remaining

2010
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:57,840
amount of essential nutrients so if you

2011
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:00,640
want to want to part two let us know

2012
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:03,039
down in the comment section below yeah

2013
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,800
let's move on to uh what do you got next

2014
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:06,560
okay just the solution to the problem

2015
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:09,279
and this is the

2016
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:11,520
one product i would actually

2017
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:12,960
say it will be is a game changer i can

2018
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,239
almost guarantee you will not find

2019
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,439
another product like this in industry i

2020
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:16,238
know you've heard that before yeah yeah

2021
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:18,639
yeah

2022
01:12:16,238 --> 01:12:21,119
but i'm guarantee you you will probably

2023
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:23,119
not find this this product out there

2024
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:24,800
five thousand dollars have went into

2025
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:26,158
verifying the science of what this

2026
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,920
product does and it's called drops of

2027
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:30,000
balance and so we'll go back to the law

2028
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:32,000
minimum real quick it states that the

2029
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,319
growth is dictated not by the total

2030
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,800
resources available but by the scarcest

2031
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:38,319
resource and we already gave the example

2032
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,400
right you have all the minerals but you

2033
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:42,158
don't have water your plants die

2034
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:43,920
same thing goes with the trace minerals

2035
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:46,399
of course we have the basics water light

2036
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,600
all those other things so what is going

2037
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:51,679
to create more coenzyme reactions even

2038
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,520
if you're not using microbiology it goes

2039
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:55,520
into the trace minerals the things that

2040
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,080
people are not discussing because the

2041
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:00,560
science isn't there really to to and the

2042
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:02,399
technology isn't there i do to create

2043
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:05,120
sensitive enough

2044
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:06,639
technology to actually identify the

2045
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:08,399
minerals and

2046
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:10,560
and their compositions it's really

2047
01:13:08,399 --> 01:13:13,439
interesting the science actually is

2048
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:16,239
we japan is 15 years 20 years ahead of

2049
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:19,519
us on water science so drop the balance

2050
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:22,319
drop balance is 34 plus negative ionic

2051
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:25,600
trace minerals sulfated trace minerals

2052
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:28,158
it cleans over 2500 plus man-made

2053
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:30,480
chemicals so it reverts them back to man

2054
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:33,198
sulfated minerals

2055
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:35,279
and that's at at a four ml rate for

2056
01:13:33,198 --> 01:13:36,719
drinking water um i'm going to talk to

2057
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:39,759
you guys clearly if you're gonna use

2058
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:42,000
this for growing it's at a rate of one

2059
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:44,880
ml per gallon so let me say it again for

2060
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,198
growing is at a rate of one ml per

2061
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,840
gallon so the 8 ounce bottle will be

2062
01:13:47,198 --> 01:13:53,359
good for 240 gallons of water

2063
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:55,039
the 16 is for 480 and 32 ounces is good

2064
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:57,198
for a thousand you need more than more

2065
01:13:55,039 --> 01:13:59,198
than that hit me up and yeah let's go

2066
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:01,198
into the next one law of tolerance the

2067
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:02,960
law stating that the abundance or

2068
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:05,198
distribution of an orgasm can be

2069
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:07,520
controlled by certain factors where if

2070
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:10,639
levels of these exceed the maximum or

2071
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:12,960
minimum limits of tolerance of that

2072
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:15,920
organism once again going back over into

2073
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:18,158
the the chart i circled the some just a

2074
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:20,960
couple of the ones we covered today look

2075
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:23,039
at all the the other ones we didn't and

2076
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,399
and this is just a very small list of

2077
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:26,479
the minerals that we could so we can

2078
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:28,559
actually create a part two three four

2079
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:30,479
this is where i want to put put a lot of

2080
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:33,039
my energy next year into the proof

2081
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:34,639
brands by perfect gardens is gaia green

2082
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:37,119
i love their brand i love their

2083
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:39,039

2084
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:41,439
thoughtful around what they do i like

2085
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:44,880
their brand earth dust nectar of the

2086
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:47,279
gods down to earth drops of balance npk

2087
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:50,079
nutrients raw if you're in hydroponics

2088
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:51,439
recharge extreme gardening they make a

2089
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:53,679
great product on extreme gardening for

2090
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:55,839
the azos and the mycos they're simple to

2091
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:57,440
use throw it in and i've always got

2092
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:59,039
great products off of them

2093
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:00,719
anyways there's a few other lines that i

2094
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:03,198
do like but for now

2095
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:04,800
i think that's about everything awesome

2096
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:06,879
well mark you were

2097
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:09,039
really the first person in this podcast

2098
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:11,440
to put together a presentation like this

2099
01:15:09,039 --> 01:15:14,719
this is phenomenal this is great a lot

2100
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:16,639
of details we touched on so much i think

2101
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:18,319
this is going to be a viewer favorite

2102
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:20,480
for sure thank you for your efforts

2103
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:21,920
there tell us where can the listeners

2104
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:23,519
find you and what do you have upcoming

2105
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,520
in the future well you can find me

2106
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,520
definitely at youtube at

2107
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:29,679
perfectgardens.com i really my goal is

2108
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:32,000
to get to one grower at a time and see

2109
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:34,319
their thoughts with see their mind with

2110
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,000
healthy thoughts on growing practices so

2111
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:38,319
i'm i'm really not putting my attention

2112
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,840
to large scale anymore i think it's the

2113
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:41,519
wrong direction of this industry and

2114
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:43,279
where it's going and i think because of

2115
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:45,440
the collapse and all the land that's

2116
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:48,238
going to become available i think the

2117
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:50,319
best place where i could put my time is

2118
01:15:48,238 --> 01:15:51,279
with a one-on-one basis

2119
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:53,439
you can also find me on

2120
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:55,119
perfectgardens.com uh where you can buy

2121
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:57,599
some of the materials you don't have to

2122
01:15:55,119 --> 01:16:00,158
not necessary and also hit me up at

2123
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:02,079
admin.com if you if you do want

2124
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:04,479
consulting on a larger scale i do offer

2125
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:06,158
