00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,480
coming up on garden talk this current

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,160
grow i just switched to gaia green and

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,759
i'm loving it i love the dry amendments

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,839
i love just amending my soil and you

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,000
leave it alone for whatever three weeks

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,759
and you top dress or you transplant you

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,839
meant it again i've seen a lot of guys

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,519
use the clear solo cups and they'll put

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,719
that inside another solo cup so that

10
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,960
then they can just pull it out just to

11
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,038
see how the roots are water your plants

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,039
12 hours in advanced he said it helps

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,640
loosen them up and that way you can bend

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,080
them a little bit easier once i get to

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,000
the vegetative stage i'm able to start

16
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,238
getting into a routine when i'm watering

ask me what problems will i run into and

112
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,438
that's kind of what we're going to get

113
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,199
into today i thought that would be a

114
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:02,239
good episode to talk about

115
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,238
problems that frequently occur when

116
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,599
gardening and not only that but

117
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,280
solutions you know what you can do to

118
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,039
prevent those problems from happening in

119
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,199
the future so i thought you'd be a good

120
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,560
candidate to have on here today but

121
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,238
before we actually get into the nitty

122
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,438
gritty of things can you tell us a

123
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,519
little bit about yourself and kind of

124
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,639
how you got into gardening

125
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,120
sure so as you all know i'm trg my name

126
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,918
is mark i'm a canadian

127
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,160
i'm a medical license holder

128
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,719
and i started growing around uh three

129
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,639
years ago and it was legalized in canada

130
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,080
and in my spare time i work on my

131
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,478
youtube channel

132
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,319
and uh yeah so once it was legalized i

133
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,319
started uh realizing that i could grow

134
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,639
for myself as i needed medicine just

135
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,319
like everybody else and as we all know

136
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,240
it can get quite pricey when you're when

137
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,079
you're buying it

138
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,720
so i decided to start growing for myself

139
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,319
and

140
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,320
i did my first grow

141
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,639
and it actually went very well i got

142
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,680
about eight ounces off four plants and i

143
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,400
figured that was pretty good for my

144
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,840
first row so i figured hey this is easy

145
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,918
i got this locked up

146
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,599
listen nah

147
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:07,599
so i went into my second row yeah no

148
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,199
i got like maybe four ounces and it

149
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,280
wasn't very good it wasn't very good at

150
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,560
all so

151
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,319
kind of a little bit discouraged and

152
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,879
said well let's do it again did a third

153
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,759
one still no

154
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,199
stop making mistakes still screwing up

155
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,479
so i was starting to get frustrated this

156
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,160
time

157
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,839
so by that time i'm kind of like well

158
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,280
what am i going to do and through all

159
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,560
these girls so far it's just been autos

160
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,559
that i've been doing i haven't done any

161
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,720
photos yet so i decided i was going to

162
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,800
try photos because i read that they are

163
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,560
a little bit more accepting to mistakes

164
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,319
and you know you're stressing out the

165
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,240
plant and they have time to recover from

166
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,000
that stuff so that's when i decided to

167
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,478
finally try photos and

168
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,519
lo and behold they went through fine

169
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,120
i had a couple times that looked

170
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,879
stressed out but i ended up getting 11

171
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,240
ounces off them and it was a fairly

172
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,240
decent grow

173
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,400
so now i'm into my second girl for uh

174
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,639
for photos and uh it's going very well

175
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,318
actually awesome awesome so what would

176
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,400
you say your overall grow style is i

177
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,199
mean are you into a grower outdoors do

178
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:06,079
you grow in soil or cocoa or hydroponics

179
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,280
uh my girl style i am an indoor grower i

180
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:11,359
tried outdoors that went horrible

181
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:14,000
so when i did that i decided to look at

182
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,038
this focus on the indoor focus on the

183
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,120
basics

184
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,519
get the basics down and then we'll worry

185
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,519
about the outdoors after so

186
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,359
besides that a growing soil i like to

187
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,839
get it just a basic soil with some of

188
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,080
them with the mycorrhizae in it

189
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,758
i do my dry amendments in it

190
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,000
and yeah that's about it it's just in

191
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,280
soil i've started in soil i like soil

192
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,120
and i'm not saying i'm never going to

193
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,679
try anything else but uh i don't know

194
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,759
dwc scares the hell out of me

195
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,519
so indoor grower tell us a little bit

196
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,038
about your current growth setup i mean

197
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:44,799
what size growth space are you working

198
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:47,360
in what do you got for lighting do you

199
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,120
have any automation so on and so forth

200
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,120
uh my current growth i'm growing in a

201
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,478
4x4 tent and i have a cmh15 i'm still

202
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,680
rocking that thing

203
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:59,199
and i got a unit farm uf 3000 that they

204
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,680
sent to me to try out

205
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,360
so that's my light system and i just set

206
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,199
up blue mats i got into the watering

207
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,720
automation and i'm kind of liking that

208
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,199
and i know you just started it so i

209
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,759
don't know how you're liking them so far

210
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,439
yeah i've been using them for a couple

211
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,919
years now actually on and off a little

212
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,519
bit yeah i i used them a while back i

213
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:19,120
had some issues with over watering i

214
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,439
think i think the medium was just too

215
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,199
saturated and then i added the blue mats

216
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,038
in so it's kept that saturation rate

217
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,800
which was like too much

218
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,399
yeah so kind of getting into problems i

219
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,319
mean it's a perfect transition you know

220
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,439
one of the first things is watering that

221
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,960
we want to talk about when we talk about

222
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,360
problems and you know blue mats

223
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,879
definitely can be a hands-off thing i

224
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,199
actually just installed blue masks this

225
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,519
morning on my current grill and i

226
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,840
watered the plant a couple days ago so i

227
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,000
got nice and saturated the way i like it

228
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,719
not over saturated but

229
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,240
waited a day or two and then sucked the

230
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,440
blue mats in there and now i'm at the

231
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,199
point where i'm gonna

232
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,360
you know doing those little adjustments

233
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,759
to make sure that's dialed in and not

234
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,319
it's not just dripping down more than it

235
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,960
needs to so yeah yeah i'm in the same

236
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,400
stage i'm adjusting small adjustments

237
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,079
you know watching the drip and making

238
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,758
sure it's not dripping too much what

239
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,439
about other problems with watering i

240
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,800
mean you were doing hand warning before

241
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,160
this do you have anything to kind of

242
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,199
talk about with uh problems with

243
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,919
watering

244
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,360
i was just horrible i'm a horrible water

245
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,598
i went from over watering to

246
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,080
underwatering back to over watering i'm

247
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,399
like man what am i doing i just i just

248
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,240
this current grow i just killed six

249
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,239
seedlings because i just i sprayed them

250
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,400
too much i'm like what am i doing

251
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,519
come on but i kind of i'm happy that

252
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,360
that happened because i kind of lit a

253
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,478
fire under my butt to say you know what

254
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,879
let's start getting a little bit more

255
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,038
serious about this because and i can see

256
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,278
it now now it's getting better

257
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,479
my girl is looking fantastic right now

258
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,240
and uh

259
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,879
but yeah again my mostly i've been over

260
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,720
watering it's my biggest problem

261
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:49,919
it's so easy to over water it and you

262
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,920
know yes

263
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,159
we can you could talk about the whole

264
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,199
finger technique in there you know your

265
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,600
first

266
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,519
finger knuckle down if it's completely

267
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,519
bone dry at that point then there's

268
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,120
watering and then lifting the grill pot

269
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,480
to check the weight you know there's

270
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,720
different techniques you can do but

271
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,959
particularly in the solo solo cups it's

272
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,040
so easy to just over water those plants

273
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,799
and unfortunately if you've if you stunt

274
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,439
the plant within the first

275
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,759
seven days of grow like you could

276
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,880
literally plant new seeds and those new

277
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,919
seeds would

278
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,919
grow faster than the stunted plants so

279
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,000
there has been grows where i've over

280
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,919
watered solo cups and had to start over

281
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,679
you know it's some people would say just

282
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,599
start over at that point but yeah it

283
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,399
could certainly be tricky on that i

284
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,920
don't know

285
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,159
i seem to do better once i get into the

286
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,399
bigger pots and then i'm able to water

287
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,319
and judge better but it's the small ones

288
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,919
that throw me off what i like to use i

289
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,760
like uh i like using a turkey baster

290
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,159
it's just a small turkey baster

291
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,679
and uh one or two squirts and that's it

292
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,639
and i just leave it alone for four or

293
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:52,159
five days and check on them yeah that's

294
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,240
a good technique and i know you know if

295
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,399
you're starting in the bigger pots kind

296
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,919
of watering directly around the seedling

297
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,919
and just kind of doing that circular

298
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,360
motion that's helpful as well because

299
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,199
certainly if you just have a seedling

300
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,480
within the first week or two

301
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,320
and you're in a five gallon container

302
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,920
for example or a larger container you

303
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,839
don't need to soak the whole grill pot

304
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,319
you know what i mean you're spending

305
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,640
seven ten fourteen days for that thing

306
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,079
to dry out and you could easily stunt

307
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,480
the plant if that medium is

308
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:21,278
oversaturated so yeah for sure for sure

309
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,519
yeah what else with watering anything

310
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,200
uh well again like i said i went from

311
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,360
over watering to underwatering where i

312
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,200
was waiting too long in between and then

313
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,680
they were drying out too much so that

314
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,120
was kind of a problem

315
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,799
corrected it and i started overwatering

316
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,078
again so

317
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:37,039
i feel like underwatering is you know

318
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,120
less

319
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:41,838
less impactful i mean you'll see the

320
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,679
droop and you easily recover off of it

321
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,279
luckily depending on how old the plant

322
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,199
is and so on and so forth you know if

323
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,639
you have a small seedling that could the

324
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,320
medium dries up the whole thing would

325
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,838
die you know the whole plant could die

326
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,600
pretty pretty easily there if you have a

327
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,680
larger plant you know in the vegetation

328
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,200
stage you know you see that major droop

329
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,639
to the point where you know you might

330
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,879
open up your grow tent once the light

331
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,720
comes on and it looks like the plant's

332
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,078
dead but you water it and you know a

333
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,800
couple hours later it's back up to

334
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,399
normal so yeah yeah for sure yeah it can

335
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,000
totally be be tricky but with a little

336
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,320
bit of practice you can definitely dial

337
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,879
things in i have been um you know i've

338
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,040
grown in solo cups to start

339
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,759
four inch nursery pots so they've ran a

340
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,120
little bit smaller than uh solo cups

341
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,519
though

342
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,120
i'm finding myself planting now in one

343
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,120
gallon containers more and more just

344
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,799
starting out in one gallon containers

345
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,399
you know there's just it seems to be a

346
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,958
little bit more beneficial in my opinion

347
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,360
i mean i'm able to have that initial

348
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,439
saturation to the way i like it at the

349
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,600
transplant less you know what i mean in

350
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,360
a sense not as would say not as often

351
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,040
but it takes me a little while till i

352
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,680
have to actually transfer

353
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,120
comparison to a when i'm in a solo cup

354
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,879
at the transmit sooner is what i'm

355
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,159
trying to say i just tried putting

356
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:51,919
starting them and that's the ones i

357
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:54,319
killed i started doing the one gallons

358
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,000
and i killed them oh really

359
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,360
yeah wow because i was thinking the same

360
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,879
lines as you i said well i'd rather

361
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,480
start it in the one gallon and give it

362
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,320
more room for the roots to expand right

363
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,240
away you know instead of these little

364
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,120
solo cups and waiting for it to

365
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,720
but it didn't work out wow yeah

366
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,959
yeah i guess you know a little bit of

367
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,959
practice and experience yeah

368
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,838
you figure it out you know for sure for

369
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,599
sure

370
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,120
now how about nutrients i mean feeding

371
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,519
nutrients is another thing where people

372
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,480
have a lot of problems with are you a

373
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,440
bottle grower or you do organics

374
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,720
you know what problems have you come

375
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,279
across there

376
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,879
i started the bottles and i always felt

377
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,039
like i was under feeding

378
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,039
they always looked faded they all you

379
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,639
know i just i found i wasn't feeding

380
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,759
them enough and probably just because i

381
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,120
didn't know when they were supposed to

382
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,000
be fed right

383
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,399
and so this is this current grow i just

384
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
switched to gaia green and i'm loving it

385
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,679
i love the dry amendments i love just

386
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,078
amending my soil and you leave it alone

387
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,599
for whatever three weeks and you top

388
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:50,399
dress or you transplant and you mend it

389
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,240
again

390
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,799
so but uh this is probably the best my

391
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,639
girl has ever looked since i started so

392
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,000
i really love the guy i agree i think a

393
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,720
problem with the dry amendments that

394
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,720
people come across a lot is they

395
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,839
will they switch from bottles to the dry

396
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,519
amendments

397
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,440
and they don't realize that the medium

398
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,159
should be saturated at all times that

399
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,320
you don't have that dry out period that

400
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,799
often people do with synthetics right

401
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,200
normally you would water the pot

402
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:20,240
let the medium dry out then re-water

403
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,278
like with synthetics with uh you know

404
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,360
organics you need that saturation

405
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,200
because microbes need to be active

406
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,320
microbes aren't active they go dormant

407
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,720
into a sleep state if the medium is dry

408
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,879
so having the medium

409
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,800
wet not wet i don't know what's kind of

410
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,799
a bad word with saturated i guess you

411
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,919
could say right or maybe even saturated

412
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,198
might be it might be

413
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:45,759
a bad word to use i think moist moist

414
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:48,719
moist there we go moist so it's moist to

415
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,720
the point where microbes can be active

416
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,839
and even that top layer right that's one

417
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,278
of the first things like if you don't

418
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,440
have your organics that don't have a

419
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,360
mulch layer for example when that grow

420
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,720
lights beaming down on that one of the

421
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,399
first things to dry out is that top

422
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,759
layer and that's where your dry

423
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,078
amendments are right when you're doing

424
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,600
the chop dressing so spraying the top of

425
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:07,120
the medium in order to keep it moist is

426
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,040
a common practice that people do in

427
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,039
order to avoid that from happening you

428
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,198
know yeah something i'm doing now is i'm

429
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,039
using rice halls as a mulch to try and

430
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,039
help keep the moisture in the soil

431
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,519
so i find that's been helping

432
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,120
nice nice yeah i use barley straw also

433
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,720
cover crops is another thing that can be

434
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,959
used to kind of help maintain the

435
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,959
moisture level down there yeah i plan on

436
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,759
getting into all that stuff baby steps

437
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,838
right

438
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:33,120
exactly while it costs you know money

439
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:37,040
and it's time i got to learn yep yep

440
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,480
now how about ph you know ppm ec you

441
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,639
know back when you would were you doing

442
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,639
that stuff when you did synthetic bottle

443
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,198
nutrients or yeah i was i was watching

444
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,240
my ppms a lot and i was watching my ph

445
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:50,559
but i had cheap amazon

446
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,720
ph pens and ppm pens

447
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,239
so i'm i'm pretty sure that my ph pen

448
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,680
kept going off and i was having a lot of

449
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,360
ph issues now i just bought uh what an

450
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,120
i think that's the uh the brand yep i

451
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,360
just bought that one so

452
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,440
i'm liking that one so far yeah i have

453
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,199
the apparel one there's actually several

454
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,639
different models for a pair yeah i

455
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,958
highly recommend

456
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,399
a pair as well rather than those cheap

457
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,759
ones and also

458
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,000
definitely recommend keeping your ph

459
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,319
meter in storage solution you know those

460
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,399
those probes will dry out

461
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,519
you know if you're spending 75

462
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,799
on a ph pen and it's dead within a year

463
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,799
because you don't put it in storage

464
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,399
solution well you can try to clean the

465
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,758
warranty on it you know the one-year

466
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,198
warranty or whatever but for the mo

467
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,199
that's still a pain to go through that

468
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,958
whole process but keeping it in storage

469
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,359
solution is definitely one of those

470
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,799
things that i feel like is a must

471
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,959
well that's the thing right because you

472
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,120
get the one from amazon the cheap one

473
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:45,838
you don't get no no kind of solution so

474
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,639
it's just starting whatever yep now do

475
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,199
you check the were you checking the ph

476
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,120
of the nutrient solution going in or the

477
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:56,000
runoff or were you doing a slurry test

478
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,519
or how would you kind of track ph

479
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,320
i was doing both i was making sure my

480
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,399
water's ph was six three to six five and

481
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,920
then i would check my runoff as well

482
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,679
just to make sure this trying to get the

483
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,039
run off of the story of the ph of the

484
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,799
soil

485
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,240
so that's what i was doing and it was

486
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,319
kind of working i was getting it for a

487
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,079
little bit but it just

488
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,680
it's not my style

489
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,838
yeah it's not

490
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,078
you know it gives you a general idea of

491
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,600
what the ph is you know particularly

492
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,198
we're talking about the runoff right

493
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,040
there have been people who have hit me

494
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:26,399
up in the past that say you shouldn't be

495
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:29,198
checking right off you should be doing a

496
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,039
slurry test instead or getting a probe

497
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,599
right he actually said that uh checking

498
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,719
the runoff was the wrong way to do it

499
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,480
which

500
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,079
you know that's an alternate way to do

501
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,360
it

502
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:40,958
it's an alternate way to do it it's

503
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,320
going to give you a general idea of what

504
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:46,239
the ph is in that in the medium you can

505
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,879
do a slurry test for sure just take some

506
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,560
of the medium out of the top of it mix

507
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,480
it in with some distilled water

508
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,319
then check the ph that way or get one of

509
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,360
those probes right those those probe

510
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,560
soil probes that go into the actual soil

511
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,560
blue lab has one but they're what like

512
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:04,639
165 are pretty pricey yeah i think

513
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,159
doesn't appear have one too

514
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,079
i think they do yeah i think they might

515
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,199
they might have one of those as well

516
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:13,599
now ppm or ec were you tracking those at

517
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,679
all uh i was watching my ppm

518
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,798
for my nutrients when i was mixing my

519
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,400
water

520
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,798
and that was about it i didn't i don't

521
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,160
know much about ec yet i'm still

522
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,240
getting there

523
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,919
but yeah i was i was just moderning my

524
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,400
ppns in my water

525
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,200
would you also do a runoff to kind of

526
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,880
check check it or what um no yeah that's

527
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,160
right i was checking my runoff for ppn

528
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,760
as well and i was using that to

529
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,960
determine when i should feed

530
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,200
and i don't know if that was the best

531
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,720
way to be doing it but

532
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,480
the general way to do it a lot of people

533
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,160
do it that way i still do it that way

534
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,919
you know i don't want to spend 100

535
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,720
whatever dollars for that soil probe to

536
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,640
kind of get a more accurate way when you

537
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,720
know the runoff method that's cheaper

538
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,799
way and you get a general idea of what

539
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,480
it is so i still do it but there is a

540
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:58,000
lot of guessing

541
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,919
when you're doing that right because you

542
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,359
have to

543
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,038
you know you get that runoff measurement

544
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,879
let's say hypothetically it's the

545
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,558
runoff's 500

546
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,880
and you're aiming for

547
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:11,359
a thousand that's right so what do you

548
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,039
do for your mixture you have to

549
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,639
have a solution

550
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,480
some people would do a solution that's a

551
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,679
thousand ppm and then put it in there

552
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,200
that's the wrong way to go about it

553
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,840
because you already have

554
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,480
roughly 500 ppm that's right in your

555
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:27,759
medium right so you would add it to it

556
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,480
so your ppm coming out should be around

557
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,480
1500. now again this is just a you know

558
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,240
gives you a general range

559
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,038
you could check the runoff and it could

560
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,919
be

561
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,038
way above that or below that it's really

562
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,160
tough and then you have to kind of

563
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:41,279
guesstimate you know because if you're

564
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,960
doing that

565
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,839
feeding when the soil dries out you

566
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,798
gotta factor in how many nutrients the

567
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:51,599
plant has up taken right so if your last

568
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:53,519
runoff measurement was 800

569
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,439
and you let the soil dry out you know

570
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,879
three four days later well it's still

571
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,519
not going to be it's not going to be 800

572
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,520
at that point right

573
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,119
it's used up some of the nutrients that

574
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,480
are already in the soil exactly so you

575
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:05,918
got to kind of guesstimate on that

576
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,679
avenue so i see a lot of people running

577
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,280
into that as a problem wish there was a

578
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,759
better solution out there you know i

579
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:12,798
wish those probes were cheaper but

580
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,480
unfortunately this is kind of where

581
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:15,839
we're at at this point

582
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,599
there'll be something that comes along

583
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,038
yeah yeah for sure how about

584
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,480
transplanting you ever had any problems

585
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:22,319
doing transplanting

586
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,759
no i'm actually not that i'm an expert

587
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,359
at it but i do pretty well at

588
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,919
transplanting um

589
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:30,319
no real issues uh i got my method where

590
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,840
i just i make my mold in my soil i get

591
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,079
my plants or my soil already ahead of

592
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:36,240
time i take an empty container and i put

593
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,918
the soil in around it and then i just

594
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,519
pull up this and it just pops right into

595
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,559
the hole so

596
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:44,240
yeah besides that no real no real issues

597
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,000
i think a common problem is

598
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,200
knowing when to transplant you know

599
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
there's some general guides out there

600
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,519
like if you're in a solo cup for example

601
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,279
what i've heard multiple times you know

602
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,440
i've heard and kind of go by sometimes

603
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:58,558
is this the earliest to transplant is

604
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,400
when the leaves kind of reach the cup

605
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,798
yeah i feel like grow and they re they

606
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,400
reach the outer edges of the cup i feel

607
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,079
like that's the earliest time you should

608
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,720
transplant you know let it grow more

609
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:11,119
than that you could have a more dense

610
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,279
root ball that helps keep that medium

611
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,879
compact i have come across i've

612
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,399
transplanted before where i go to

613
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,640
transplant all of a sudden the medium

614
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,200
crumbles up because the root zone isn't

615
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,000
established you know so kind of knowing

616
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,880
when to transplant i feel like can be

617
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,960
difficult and i've popped plants out of

618
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,400
you know slowly gently brought it out to

619
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,720
see if there was a root zone that's

620
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,480
developed and then kind of i say oh no

621
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,919
not really want to be it slide it back

622
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,599
in so you can certainly do that if

623
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,919
you're a beginner and you're not really

624
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:42,719
sure if the root ball has developed or

625
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,480
not i've seen a lot of guys use uh

626
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,240
the clear solo cups and they'll put that

627
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,599
inside another solo cup so that then

628
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,440
they can just pull it out just to see

629
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,879
how the roots are that's a great great

630
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,679
call out right there yeah having that

631
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,919
clear cup within another cup uh it is

632
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,080
important to have the just not have a

633
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,880
clear cup because

634
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:03,918
light hitting the roots no bueno

635
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,520
not good at all um and also algae's a

636
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,280
thing that people can come across as

637
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,038
well right if light penetrates down

638
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,599
there and it's you know saturated medium

639
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:13,279
algae can certainly grow so yeah there's

640
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,119
two reasons why i kind of have a dark

641
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,720
container i know i was looking at thc

642
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,119
titans instagram page and this was

643
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,079
several months ago and some company made

644
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:21,759
white

645
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,839
fabric grow pots

646
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,038
and the thing was just loaded with algae

647
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,119
all around because the light was

648
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:29,119
piercing through that grill pot yeah you

649
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,199
know so that's that's a huge i don't

650
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,719
even know why the company made made a

651
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,480
white grill pot they weren't thinking or

652
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,839
something but but yeah that those are a

653
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,159
couple problems that happened with

654
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:40,639
transplanting that i've come across or

655
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,440
seen yeah that's a little weird to go

656
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,880
white

657
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,080
yeah

658
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,840
how about training plants a lot of

659
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,000
people do training whether it be you

660
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,000
know topping low stress training you

661
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,519
know super cropping what training do you

662
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,720
do and what problems have you kind of

663
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,798
come across

664
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,480
uh in the past i've mostly just just

665
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,000
gently bent them over

666
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,200
i used to call it super cropping but

667
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
somebody told me no that's not super

668
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,640
cropping so i wasn't super cropping

669
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,720
but i tried with the tie downs and uh

670
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,720
what else was i trying

671
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,159
i think that's all i tried before oh i

672
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,640
tried topping but i didn't do a lot of

673
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,240
topping i just topped a couple just grow

674
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,200
that i'm doing now now i've talked i

675
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,798
talked like almost everyone that came up

676
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,120
so this is the first time we're really

677
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:23,440
topping and i have canopy clips which

678
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,719
i'm using to spread out the plant which

679
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,080
they're great i recommend them for

680
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,200
anybody canopy clips are awesome

681
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:30,798
and that way you don't have to worry

682
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,159
about tying it down with wires and stuff

683
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,319
like that

684
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,159
i like those canopy clips problems that

685
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,599
i've come across while snapping branches

686
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,280
i think you know when you're low stress

687
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:40,879
training snapping that branch that's

688
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,639
usually a heartbreaker you know

689
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,720
manipulating that the top part of the

690
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,840
branch is one way to go about it usually

691
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,919
the top right branch is a little bit

692
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:50,558
softer i know if you bring your temps

693
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:53,679
real low you know real low the

694
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:55,519
60s degree fahrenheit in the 50s those

695
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,360
branches will kind of harden up less

696
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,960
chances of being able to manipulate

697
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,798
those plants you know bend those plants

698
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,319
without them snapping sure your

699
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:05,279
temperatures are in check it could be a

700
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:07,119
good solution when tying down i use the

701
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,720
wire ties and i have like a clip that

702
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,959
kind of clips the pot and then use the

703
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,558
wire ties i had there has been times

704
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,038
where i've actually you know tied it

705
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,000
down and the branch

706
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:18,319
grew

707
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,880
into the tie yeah i've seen that too

708
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,359
yeah yes i've had that happen before i

709
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,320
try to do just a loop around so i don't

710
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,399
actually like

711
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,639
tie like yeah it's just kind of like a

712
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,240
little hook yeah yeah kind of hook but

713
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,159
even if it's wrapped around twice it'll

714
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,720
kind of unwind you know what i mean

715
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,960
versus you know like a bread like when

716
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,279
you're doing like a bread tie

717
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,038
yeah you know twisting it together so i

718
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:42,879
avoid twisting it together at all costs

719
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:44,879
in order to prevent the branch from

720
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,080
growing into the tie

721
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,440
something else i've seen other guys

722
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:49,359
starting to use is i think they're

723
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,200
called

724
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:53,199
uh i can't remember now grass clips or

725
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,000
something like that they're about

726
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,200
three inches long and

727
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,798
that's all you do is you just push it

728
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,480
down into the soil with the branch in it

729
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,240
and it just pushes it down

730
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,360
instead of using the ties right okay

731
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,519
yeah yeah i've seen those i can't

732
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,719
remember what they're called yeah now do

733
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,918
you do any super cropping at all or no

734
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,679
i tried

735
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,360
like i said the guy one guy told me that

736
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,880
i was doing it wrong and

737
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,240
i guess i was because he was saying you

738
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,159
could do that big pinch and you got to

739
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,558
get at the bend over i wasn't doing that

740
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,480
i was just gently bending them over

741
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:24,879
but uh the tip that he did give me was

742
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,960
to water your plants 12 hours in advance

743
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,159
he said it helps loosen them up and that

744
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,120
way you can bend them a little bit

745
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,039
easier

746
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,519
yeah yeah that's a good one as well and

747
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:35,519
then silica as well will help with yes

748
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,278
kind of branch manipulation if you're

749
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,879
using silica definitely helps when

750
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:40,400
training plants yeah i got silica in

751
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,320
there right now

752
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,798
nice nice yeah i've been using it for

753
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,639
ibm how about controlling environment

754
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,158
you know easier said than done right i

755
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,840
mean remember the first time i ever set

756
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,440
up a grow tent you know i thought it was

757
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,798
going to be easy to get the temperature

758
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,400
stable i thought it was going to be easy

759
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:56,720
to get the humidity where i wanted it to

760
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,400
be then you add in the exhaust fan and

761
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,798
all of a sudden it sucks out all the

762
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,720
humidity out of the tent yeah exactly

763
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,079
out of the tent or you put your hps grow

764
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,079
light in there and

765
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,319
the temperature skyrockets you know what

766
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:11,839
do you do to control the environment to

767
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:13,678
kind of help stabilize your conditions

768
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,199
uh the biggest thing that i well i just

769
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,278
upgraded my exhaust van i ended up

770
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,400
buying an ac infinity uh

771
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:20,400
t6

772
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,840
so that thing's amazing

773
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,200
one punch of a button and you can

774
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,480
control your environment this is the

775
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,519
most control i've ever had over my

776
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,200
environment

777
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,278
but i'm pretty lucky where i am because

778
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,159
my relative humidity is roughly around

779
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,759
60 my house anyways so the only thing

780
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,520
i'm using right now is a humidifier i

781
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,679
don't use a dehumidifier i don't use a

782
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,079
heater i don't use ac i don't have to

783
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,400
use any of that stuff so just my natural

784
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,240
environment just is very ideal

785
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,798
for what i'm doing so

786
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,640
uh besides that

787
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:51,599
lots of fans i got all these different

788
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,120
fans that i use uh ipad stands so that

789
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:54,959
way i can put them at different levels

790
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:55,599
and you just put plop the fan on top of

791
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,679
it

792
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,839
so i got about four or five fans going

793
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,360
to keep the airflow and just i have one

794
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,038
blowing right on the lights to try and

795
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,678
reduce the the temperature

796
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,759
and yeah that's about it really oh and i

797
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,759
have a fan blowing air into my tent

798
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,278
through the through the bed okay yeah

799
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,519
it's definitely some good techniques in

800
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:16,880
order to help control the environment i

801
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:18,879
also have the ac infiniti fan

802
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,720
it's such a game changer isn't it it is

803
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,480
it is

804
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,159
it's awesome i have you know certain set

805
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,558
points so when the temperature reaches i

806
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,679
think i have one set to 82 degrees

807
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:29,359
fahrenheit

808
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,038
once it reaches that it'll start to you

809
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,918
know the fan will slowly turn on yeah

810
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:33,278
and then

811
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,880
exhaust some of that hot air you know

812
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:36,400
and exchange the air as well obviously

813
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,000
if it's removing some of the air and

814
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,000
then once the temperature drops down

815
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,319
because the air coming in from the

816
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,880
intake vent on my grotesque cooler it's

817
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:46,720
cooler so it does drop it humidity i

818
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,480
live in a very dry environment so i do

819
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,079
have humidifier i have in my fire in my

820
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,679
tent i have humidifier outside of my

821
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:54,158
tent in order to try to make sure that

822
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,919
the air coming into the tent is of the

823
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,600
proper humidity now back in the day i

824
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,759
used to struggle because

825
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:03,038
you know my natural humidity is

826
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,798
20 30 yeah you know so it's like

827
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,119
even if if i only have a humidifier

828
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,720
inside my grow tent well that's fine

829
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:10,399
it'll boost it up to where it needs to

830
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,720
be but once that

831
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,000
inline fan kicks on ac infinity well

832
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,880
it's bringing in

833
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,359
20 to 30 humidity you know so having

834
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,360
making sure that i have a humidifier

835
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:23,278
outside just in my grow room

836
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,199
yeah as well

837
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:26,880
is definitely helpful for sure

838
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,558
yeah yeah yeah to have one in your lung

839
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,240
room that helps out lung room yeah

840
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:32,639
that's what i mean by that yep how about

841
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,519
the seedling stage any problems in

842
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,880
particular we'll go through the

843
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,319
different stages we'll start with

844
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,840
seedling then we'll go into veg then

845
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:39,519
we'll go into flowering

846
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:41,678
well see if we can stage besides i kill

847
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,679
them

848
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:44,960
that's that's about it you know

849
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:46,398
it's just

850
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,919
i struggle with it i struggle at the

851
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,839
beginning i don't know why yet but i

852
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,080
guess because they're so fragile right

853
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:54,720
it doesn't take much to kill them so

854
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:57,199
i'm still learning so hopefully

855
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,960
i'll get that under control

856
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,840
yeah i've had problems with frying

857
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,798
seedlings you know particularly with hps

858
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:05,119
you know back in the day when i was

859
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,398
running hps i you know having that light

860
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,599
too close

861
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,879
yeah you know i used to think the more

862
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:12,480
light the better well uh no it'll die so

863
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,159
i fried ceilings before because i had

864
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,399
the light too close also on the flip

865
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,640
side having the temperature

866
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,558
of the medium too low has hindered

867
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,759
seedling growth right so particularly in

868
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:23,599
the winter time you know if you're

869
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:24,960
putting your solar cups for example if

870
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,278
you put them on the ground or actually

871
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,519
any container on the ground you could

872
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,839
come across where the medium is

873
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:34,158
too low in temperature it slows down

874
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,000
microbial growth slows down growth just

875
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,120
entirely right so that is definitely

876
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,720
hindered growth i know a lot of people

877
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,319
are basement growers

878
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,919
common mistake for basement growers is

879
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,480
they put it directly on the ground right

880
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,200
and it's just the cold coldness just

881
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,240
completely stunts the plant i mean it's

882
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,240
really bad

883
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,558
i'm in the basement so that's what i do

884
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,558
yeah it gets quite cold where i am like

885
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:57,519
i'm talking minus 30 minus 40 sometimes

886
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,440
so that basement floor is quite cold

887
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:00,798
so what do you do i raise them up a

888
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,840
little bit give them about an inch off

889
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:03,759
the ground

890
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:05,918
just so that they got airflow underneath

891
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:08,079
what do you what do you raise it up with

892
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,520
uh i have like crates and stuff like

893
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,519
that

894
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,519
whatever is handy that's whatever i can

895
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,359
use to get up off the ground yeah i've

896
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,000
used like two by fours before and yeah

897
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,839
two but yeah that works too yeah yeah

898
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,038
how about the vegetation stage any

899
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:25,759
problems come to mind for the vegetation

900
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:28,558
no not really that's been one of my

901
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:30,240
stages that i actually do well in

902
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,759
but you know because i

903
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,278
once i get to the vegetative stage i'm

904
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:35,119
able to start getting into a routine

905
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,440
when i'm watering when am i feeding uh

906
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,959
you know what am i training

907
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,558
and that's probably why i like it

908
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,840
because it's more of a routine rather

909
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,319
than the seasoning stage it's like oh

910
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:44,319
what do i do

911
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:49,119
so yeah besides that i have not too many

912
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,798
problems with my vegetative stage

913
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,398
the vegetation you know arguably is one

914
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:53,759
of the easier stages you know in my

915
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:56,319
opinion you know especially if you're

916
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:58,319
growing in a soil that is enriched with

917
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,639
nutrients already right fox motion for

918
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,798
soil i mean that's going to last you

919
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,038
you know roughly 30 40 days depending on

920
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,158
the size of your container so you know

921
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:07,599
once the plant's out of the seedling

922
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,278
stage it's still got plenty of nutrients

923
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:11,759
right so you know most people aren't

924
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,278
doing any sort of feeding oh until some

925
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,798
people go all the way 30 40 days and

926
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,398
then put the flowers they don't do any

927
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:18,319
feeding veg at all

928
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:21,038
so in my opinion the veg stage is one of

929
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,960
the easier stages one problem that i can

930
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:25,278
think of is

931
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,159
knowing when to flip to flower

932
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:28,159
because

933
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,159
you know just the fact that you don't

934
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,039
know how long how much it's going to

935
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,120
stretch

936
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:34,319
that's cultivar dependent obviously your

937
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:35,918
lighting is going to impact it your

938
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,319
nutrition all there's so many different

939
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,480
variables that can impact growth i've

940
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:42,079
had plants that were you know stretched

941
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,038
three times the amount once i flipped to

942
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:46,558
12 12. and so i ran out of height right

943
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:47,599
so that's the problem right it stretched

944
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:49,359
three times the amount i wasn't

945
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:50,798
expecting that much of a stretch

946
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:52,398
now my lights all the way up to the the

947
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:54,398
top what do i do you know then you're

948
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:55,759
bending branches down yeah that's a

949
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:56,959
common problem that people actually you

950
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:59,200
know reach out to me they're like oh

951
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,840
crap i ran out of space you know

952
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,679
what do i do now you know what what are

953
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,319
the options right you're either

954
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,320
you know pruning those branches off

955
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:09,519
sometimes right if you're like week one

956
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:10,879
into stretch

957
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,519
or you know you're gonna have a couple

958
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,000
more weeks of growth so literally

959
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,200
pruning branches off that are the top

960
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,278
branches off is an option at that point

961
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,120
without destroying your yield i don't

962
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:24,480
know you know a lot some people yield is

963
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:25,918
their goal some people don't but

964
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,278
certainly it could be an impact there

965
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,440
you know the general rule of thumb is

966
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:30,880
just expect the plant to stretch double

967
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,440
the amount

968
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,120
it is at the time of flip you know yeah

969
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,558
usually for the first three weeks right

970
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:38,639
but that's not always the case you know

971
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,798
you got you have cultivars that don't

972
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,919
stretch at all yeah i've had cultivars

973
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:45,599
which i expected them to stretch 2x

974
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,360
and they didn't barely even stretch at

975
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:48,879
all i'm like oh crap yeah stuck with

976
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:50,240
this small plant i was expecting it to

977
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,519
stretch so much more and then and then

978
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,200
you're stuck at that point

979
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,200
you know finish growing the plant yeah i

980
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,120
have the same problem i'm never quite

981
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,038
sure when to flip

982
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:00,719
i'm always kind of guessing

983
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:02,879
uh how about flowering problems in

984
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,640
flowering what do you got uh

985
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,278
i think my with the flowering

986
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,840
i'm never sure how much to feed that's

987
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:11,200
that's been my one of my main problems

988
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:12,839
and i don't know if i was supposed to

989
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,919
increase or

990
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:17,918
decrease uh yeah i wasn't sure but

991
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,278
besides that it's no different than the

992
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,640
vegetative stage

993
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:21,919
because you're still in your routine

994
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,919
right you're still you know you're not

995
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,200
doing is really training anymore and

996
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,840
unless like you said it's getting too

997
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,360
close to the light

998
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:31,519
so yeah for me it's just basically when

999
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:33,759
the flip and my feeding schedule i

1000
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,519
wasn't sure about the feeding schedule

1001
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:36,960
it can be tricky i mean i've had plans

1002
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,720
yellow out too early and i think that's

1003
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,679
a common problem right when plants start

1004
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,120
to yellow you know week four or five and

1005
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,640
you're like oh crap why is it starting

1006
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:46,000
to yellow at this point right and that

1007
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,120
kind of goes back to the fundamentals

1008
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,398
you know if you're growing bottled

1009
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:50,798
nutrients

1010
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:52,558
you know what was the ph what's the ppm

1011
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:54,558
are you in the proper ranges you know

1012
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,960
that's right if you're organic growing

1013
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:58,158
well maybe you didn't top dress enough

1014
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,919
during that flip like you should have

1015
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,278
maybe you're the the the medium is

1016
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,640
drying out on the top where your top

1017
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:03,759
dressing amendments are and the microbes

1018
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,960
aren't breaking them down you know so

1019
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:07,519
those are things you got to kind of look

1020
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,720
at another problem in flowering is you

1021
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,000
know when you get to the point where you

1022
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,679
are at week five six seven and they

1023
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,919
start flopping over right so having

1024
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,000
support for plants yeah kind of planning

1025
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,240
ahead on that avenue i mean i used to

1026
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,599
use tomato cages

1027
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,359
okay i don't know if you've ever tried

1028
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:26,158
to put a tomato cage on a plant that's

1029
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:27,199
in week six or seven and flowering like

1030
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,720
trying to

1031
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,278
to put it above it's just it's so

1032
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,880
difficult so you know planning ahead

1033
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:34,319
making sure you have like a trellis net

1034
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,159
for example a lot of people use chelsea

1035
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:39,119
for support not just to get a high yield

1036
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:41,360
but using it as support stakes are good

1037
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:43,759
to have on hand for support some people

1038
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:45,599
use those yo-yos and they hang them from

1039
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,519
above and they come down and help

1040
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:49,359
support those branches above some people

1041
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,599
use like those bamboo stakes and now

1042
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:53,918
they'll kind of square them in similar

1043
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:55,439
to how a tomato cage is so there's so

1044
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,200
many different ways you can go

1045
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,278
when it comes to supporting your plants

1046
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,120
and make sure the branches stay upright

1047
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,278
and also you know other things look at

1048
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:05,359
calcium you know silica can help with

1049
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:07,359
with the cell structure and keeping the

1050
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,440
plants upright um but yeah i think

1051
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:10,719
that's a common problem is plants

1052
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,720
flopping all over the place towards the

1053
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,719
end of flowering yeah yeah i had that

1054
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,799
problem last time too it was uh they

1055
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,878
were falling over so i was tying the

1056
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,119
little strings from the corners to the

1057
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:22,398
to the plants and trying to get them to

1058
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,399
stay up and

1059
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:25,598
they were stolen

1060
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:27,279
i guess that's a good problem right and

1061
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,519
these are getting heavy so

1062
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,839
yeah i've had branches like snap too

1063
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,519
yeah like really yeah snap completely

1064
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:35,679
it's like what the heck so i had to

1065
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,759
harvest at that time yeah it was a

1066
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,280
pretty pretty clean snap too it's like

1067
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,440
you know you could try to tape it up but

1068
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,359
this one wasn't wasn't able to recover

1069
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,358
at that point so um oh what about

1070
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:46,799
lighting i know lighting's a huge one i

1071
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:48,398
mean with these new grow lights people

1072
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,079
are burning their plants people don't

1073
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,000
know what the correct light distance is

1074
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,440
with the dimmer and stuff have you come

1075
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,679
across any problems with lighting and

1076
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,599
like light distance and all that stuff

1077
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,280
um just uh

1078
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,119
trial and error was learning where to

1079
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,960
put my light because like i said i'm

1080
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,838
still rocking the cmh so i don't have a

1081
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,480
dimmer on it okay so i'm just going by

1082
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:10,078
measuring how far it is and just looking

1083
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,440
at how there's the plants are responding

1084
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,480
to it if they're looking a little bit

1085
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,480
droopy or looking a little stressed it's

1086
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,679
time to raise the light of it or just

1087
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,358
either start the stretch well maybe it's

1088
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:21,519
time to lower the light a bit i feel

1089
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:25,519
like it's easier in that sense growing

1090
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:28,079
with hid whether it be hps mh or cmh is

1091
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:30,400
like distance because it's pretty pretty

1092
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,800
standard in a sense right like was it 12

1093
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,280
to 14 inches for flowering

1094
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,839
18 to 20 inches

1095
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,000
yeah you know 24 to 36 inches for

1096
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:42,000
seedlings that's pretty standard you

1097
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,559
know it's a led i mean you got to worry

1098
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,800
about the dimmer if you want to use that

1099
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:49,519
and then also the the distance on top of

1100
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,680
that so i actually have a whole video on

1101
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:54,320
kind of how to determine like distance

1102
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:56,159
using the dimmer on your grill lights so

1103
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,000
if you guys want to check that out on my

1104
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:59,759
channel just search for it and you'll

1105
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,760
you'll find it and gives you some

1106
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,800
additional tips on what you can do to

1107
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,480
dial in that light distance so nice yeah

1108
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,599
no i was just going to say i i will be

1109
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,280
having those kind of problems because i

1110
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,960
am upgrading my lights

1111
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,079
yep soon enough you'll face it yeah it's

1112
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,240
coming

1113
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,839
yeah light burning is like just the

1114
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:19,039
number one thing i mean people are just

1115
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:21,440
yeah they're putting their girl lights

1116
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:23,358
too close too high of intensity

1117
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,800
yeah it's just it looks like other it

1118
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:26,799
looks like other issues too like it

1119
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,480
looks like calcium deficiency a lot of

1120
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,839
people mistake it for

1121
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,280
really it's just

1122
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:33,279
you're burning your plants you know

1123
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,440
calcium deficiency you'll see the rust

1124
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,359
spotting you know on the leaves

1125
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,280
you'll kind of see that only kind of be

1126
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:40,880
a different pattern with the light burn

1127
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,160
but you'll notice it more on the top

1128
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,640
part of the plant and you also you

1129
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:46,239
notice like more yellow margins on the

1130
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,639
leaves and like the leaves will you know

1131
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:50,479
potentially start curling you know up up

1132
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,159
or down like burnt

1133
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,639
looking burnt in a sense that's kind of

1134
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:56,399
how you know you have light burn versus

1135
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:58,559
calcium deficiency

1136
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,079
yeah i've seen that

1137
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,960
yeah

1138
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:05,599
how about pests any problems with pests

1139
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,400
uh the only biggest problem i've had so

1140
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,920
far knock on wood because

1141
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,680
yeah i know it's it's gonna come it's

1142
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,519
gonna happen so the only problem i've

1143
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:15,838
had is with fungus gnats

1144
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:18,239
and uh what i use for ipm is uh like i

1145
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:20,000
said i use uh diatomaceous earth

1146
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:20,799
what i like to do on whether just a top

1147
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,880
dress

1148
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,000
i've seen guys put it right all over

1149
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,440
their flowers i don't know if that's the

1150
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,280
right way to do it or not but when do

1151
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,400
you apply the diatomaceous earth on that

1152
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,240
medium

1153
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,000
um usually i

1154
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:34,078
amended it when i first

1155
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,480
amended my soil when i was first

1156
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,599
starting and then when i transplant it i

1157
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,920
did it again

1158
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,680
so probably when i top dress i might do

1159
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,680
it again i'm not sure

1160
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,279
okay yeah funky snacks is something i

1161
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:46,399
battle with as well you know once in a

1162
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,680
while

1163
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,000
i feel like those are one of the easiest

1164
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:51,919
pests to to get rid of i mean yeah

1165
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,400
number one yellow sticky traps is what i

1166
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,920
usually use and have those by the medium

1167
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,800
so you can kind of see if you have the

1168
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,200
problem

1169
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,800
that's right you know and then letting

1170
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:02,480
the medium dry out is another way to go

1171
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,560
about it you know particularly with the

1172
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,440
synthetic nutrients right you yes you

1173
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,119
can have the medium kind of dry out and

1174
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,240
then the fungus gnats go away in my

1175
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,320
experience and sometimes you need to let

1176
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:13,598
the medium dry out multiple times before

1177
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,800
they truly go away because you've got

1178
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,240
the eggs hatching down there and all

1179
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,079
that stuff now when you're with or

1180
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:19,679
organics you know people would argue

1181
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,680
that you should never have the medium

1182
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:23,440
dry out however if you're in a desperate

1183
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:25,199
situation to where you've got an

1184
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,280
infestation of fungus gnats and they're

1185
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:29,279
destroying your plant well then you

1186
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,640
might want to you know last yeah last

1187
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,040
stitch effort you might want to let that

1188
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,879
medium dry out or do that diatomaceous

1189
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,960
earth like like you do which i i haven't

1190
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,000
used myself my heart is extremely

1191
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,720
effective

1192
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,960
it is yes i recommend it for anybody any

1193
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:45,118
other problems with pests at all i know

1194
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,159
you've been growing for

1195
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,800
he about three years

1196
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:50,719
and no that's been about it uh there's

1197
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,480
one time i thought i had spider mites

1198
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:53,759
but i didn't i was just

1199
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,960
being foolish

1200
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,720
it was actually a mold from uh

1201
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,039
you know mushroom mycelium sorry

1202
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:02,799
mycelium it's like everybody's like no

1203
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:05,920
no that's not fungus or it's not uh

1204
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,519
spider mites it's just mycelium yeah yep

1205
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,880
now how about harvesting

1206
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:10,480
any problems with harvesting what do you

1207
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,880
usually do for harvesting

1208
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,760
uh harvesting i uh i usually chop my

1209
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,000
plant down a hole i don't do individual

1210
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,599
branches and i hang it up like that

1211
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,159
and just this past grows when i first

1212
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,920
start i started using um

1213
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,838
hanging in my tent

1214
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,440
so and i found that gave me a lot more

1215
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:30,000
control over my environment that way

1216
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,240
instead of hanging in a utility closet

1217
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,519
with you know no fans no humidifier or

1218
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:34,879
anything like that

1219
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:37,119
so

1220
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,760
i i got a good dry out of it the last

1221
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,760
time i probably got about like 14 days a

1222
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,000
good two weeks so i was quite pleased

1223
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,760
with that but besides that it's just uh

1224
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,280
after that then i do individual branches

1225
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,560
of just trimming and

1226
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,480
i trim with the scissors i don't have

1227
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,639
any fancy machines

1228
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,280
i do the old-fashioned trimming

1229
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:57,039
and i i enjoy trim jail just like

1230
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,519
everybody else

1231
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,239
i think a common problem with harvesting

1232
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:01,759
is

1233
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:03,279
folks don't know when to harvest or they

1234
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,359
harvest too early

1235
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,680
you know i mean investing in that

1236
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:10,719
microscope to see the color of the

1237
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:13,279
tricoms is definitely a beneficial and

1238
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,199
now most of the time a lot of folks have

1239
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,240
good smartphones where you can

1240
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:19,279
take a close-up picture of the plant of

1241
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:22,078
the bud

1242
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,839
and then zoom into that picture to see

1243
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,079
the color of the trichomes so i can do

1244
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,559
that on my phone i have the the pixel 5.

1245
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,400
my roommate has a samsung is actually i

1246
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:33,039
i think looks better than mine i'm sure

1247
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,400
i have an iphone his stellar camera on

1248
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,960
that one so a lot of people don't even

1249
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,400
need the mic microscope anymore you know

1250
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,000
yeah i got the same i got the samsung

1251
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,440
and it has an incredible camera it's

1252
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,760
unbelievable

1253
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,599
yeah so microscopes are about to be

1254
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,520
obsolete when it comes to thanks

1255
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,760
checking the trichomes soon huh i think

1256
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:50,960
so yep i've been knowing when to harvest

1257
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,720
i mean you know the color of the

1258
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,519
trichomes is something that people look

1259
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:55,759
at

1260
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,440
mostly cloudy is what i aim for

1261
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,720
at that point there is some amber in

1262
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,720
there some people look for a certain

1263
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:02,719
percentage of amber

1264
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:04,239
i don't really go by that i mean i think

1265
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:06,078
when the trichomes are mostly cloudy

1266
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:07,519
that might be you know ten percent amber

1267
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,960
or something like that yeah but it

1268
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,599
really comes down to personal preference

1269
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,559
on when you want to harvest

1270
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,318
for sure

1271
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:17,358
for sure for sure and that's generally

1272
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:18,838
what i look i look about for 80 to 20 80

1273
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:20,639
to 20

1274
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:22,318
roughly it's

1275
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:23,598
whatever happens sometimes you just have

1276
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:25,199
to like you said before sometimes you

1277
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,440
just have to harvest it it doesn't

1278
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,879
matter what the trichomes look like

1279
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,800
now i know you touched a little bit on

1280
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,079
drying dive a little bit deeper into

1281
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,960
that so dry environment i know i use a

1282
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,640
grow tent mostly i mean i've dried in

1283
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,599
closets before i've drafted bathrooms

1284
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:43,838
before driving regular bedrooms before

1285
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,000
but uh being able to have that proper

1286
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:48,239
temperature and humidity during drying

1287
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
as well is arguably just as important if

1288
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,439
not more important than the temperature

1289
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,239
humidity when you're growing the plant

1290
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,000
right

1291
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:55,439
absolutely absolutely yeah what do you

1292
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,318
aim for for temperature and humidity

1293
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,240
when drying i i go with the 60 60 method

1294
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:01,279
60 humidity 60

1295
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:02,318
10

1296
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,079
that's

1297
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:05,838
that's why how i got it the last time

1298
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,240
and it was uh

1299
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:10,078
probably the best harvest i've had

1300
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:13,439
more and more people go into the 60 60

1301
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:16,640
route you know i generally do 55 to 60

1302
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,720
rh and then i try to get down to 60. you

1303
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,639
know room temperature around 70 degrees

1304
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:23,838
fahrenheit is acceptable for sure one

1305
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:26,000
could argue against 60 degrees versus 70

1306
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:27,679
degrees now we know terpenes evaporate

1307
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,519
at different temperatures so one could

1308
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,358
argue that hey if you're drying at 70

1309
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:33,838
degrees well then some of those terpenes

1310
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:35,119
are evaporating versus you know 60

1311
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:37,199
degrees you're having less terpenes

1312
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,119
evaporate so i've been finding myself

1313
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:40,719
trying to get the temp lower and lower

1314
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,440
to achieve that 60 but i don't really

1315
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:44,799
beat myself up you know from around 70.

1316
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,880
it's i

1317
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,920
start to panic a little bit when i'm at

1318
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,039
like

1319
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,559
over 75 you know then i'm like oh great

1320
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:53,838
good now i really should be taking

1321
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,318
actions in order to try to get that

1322
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:57,199
temperature down because again terpenes

1323
00:42:56,318 --> 00:42:59,199
are evaporating at different

1324
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:02,399
temperatures you're just losing it and

1325
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,679
that that smell and the flavor as well

1326
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,800
oh yeah for sure

1327
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,039
and then making sure there's air

1328
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,318
exchange in the environment right so

1329
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:10,318
there should be exchange shouldn't be

1330
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:12,079
stagnant i think you mentioned that you

1331
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:13,599
have a fan in there to kind of make sure

1332
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,200
air is blowing around

1333
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,519
you can easily if you have stagnant air

1334
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:18,159
in there you could easily get mold you

1335
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:20,960
know

1336
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:23,118
especially if you're running 60 rh you

1337
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,838
know that plus stagnant air that's a

1338
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,640
recipe of a disaster right

1339
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:28,239
there now it's happened to me before you

1340
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:30,480
know accidentally but making sure

1341
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:32,559
there's a certain exchange now i usually

1342
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,960
trying to grow tent and sometimes i'll

1343
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,279
keep that grow tent cracked open so that

1344
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,280
way you know there is some exchange i

1345
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,880
make sure it's dark as well right light

1346
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,800
shouldn't be shining on your plants

1347
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,358
while they're drying because light uh

1348
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,519
degrades those trichomes right yeah my

1349
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:49,920
tent my 4x4 is kind of one of those

1350
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:52,960
knock-off ones so i do have light leaks

1351
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,880
so i i put a blanket over it to block it

1352
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,159
because i only have one dollar entrance

1353
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,000
so i put a blanket right over it to

1354
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:59,920
block it where the zippers are so it

1355
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,960
seemed to help last time how about

1356
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:06,480
curing last but not least curing another

1357
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,960
thing that i feel is overlooked often oh

1358
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,440
have you had any problems with curing

1359
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,440
uh again just only problems just from

1360
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,119
learning right it's not because i had

1361
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,240
any major issues

1362
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,039
but

1363
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:21,598
i do the cure i do the uh the burping to

1364
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,279
twice a day for for a week and then down

1365
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,640
to once a day for another week and then

1366
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,319
after that

1367
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:27,920
i might still burp once here and there

1368
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:29,519
but then you kind of start just letting

1369
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,519
them sit and be

1370
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:34,159
just let them cure for as long as you

1371
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:35,679
can without smoking it

1372
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:38,159
i think it's very important to make sure

1373
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:40,159
that just the humidity is not too much

1374
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:42,239
in the container i mean i

1375
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:44,000
highly recommend buying

1376
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:45,439
spending the money to get hygrometers

1377
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,358
right you can get a 12 pack of those

1378
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,519
little hygrometers the digital i got

1379
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:51,279
some of those that fit in the jars we

1380
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:52,400
get i think they're like probably 20

1381
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,599
bucks or something like that for a

1382
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,920
12-pack

1383
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,000
i highly recommend you you get that and

1384
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,920
and monitor that because

1385
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,639
if the humidity is too high in the

1386
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,480
container mold mold occurs you know and

1387
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,000
you've ruined your harvest at that point

1388
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,039
that's right so spending the twenty

1389
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,559
dollars on the hygrometers for your jars

1390
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,480
i think is a must in my opinion

1391
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:14,960
absolutely oh yeah i got them i use

1392
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,880
those as well yeah so what other advice

1393
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,199
do you have for growers who are

1394
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,079
just getting started with growing

1395
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:23,679
uh what i would say is first of all be

1396
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,280
patient

1397
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,519
you're gonna make a mistake you're gonna

1398
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,319
make lots of them

1399
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:32,559
and uh just don't freak out if things

1400
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:33,679
aren't going right uh you know most

1401
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:35,440
people start growing and they're

1402
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:37,199
following somebody on youtube

1403
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,720
some kind of content creator well reach

1404
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:40,639
out to them the

1405
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:42,159
most of them have discords or even just

1406
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:44,000
on the videos themselves in the comments

1407
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:45,279
like just reach out to them and ask them

1408
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,559
the question

1409
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,480
there's not too many that don't want to

1410
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:49,920
help that's basically why we're all here

1411
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,440
right is to help other people learn how

1412
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,440
to grow so

1413
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,800
uh yeah most definitely just be patient

1414
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:59,440
and don't be afraid to ask for help and

1415
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,599
yeah just research read

1416
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,119
research watch

1417
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,519
and

1418
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,119
get a mentor if you can

1419
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:08,719
that's always helpful

1420
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,079
to have somebody to show you what to do

1421
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:11,199
and how to do it

1422
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,760
because

1423
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,439
learning on your own it's fun but

1424
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,960
you make a lot of mistakes

1425
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,880
i think that's really great advice yeah

1426
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,199
you touched on a lot of good good pieces

1427
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,720
there for sure so wrapping things up how

1428
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:24,399
can listeners find you and what do you

1429
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,919
have upcoming in the future well

1430
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,400
everybody can find me obviously on

1431
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,280
youtube as the rookie grower i'm on

1432
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,838

1437
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,239
so uh besides that what do i have

1438
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:45,679
currently i'm working on uh it's called

my chaotic run

1440
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:50,960
and it's a uh i'm showcasing a breeder

1441
