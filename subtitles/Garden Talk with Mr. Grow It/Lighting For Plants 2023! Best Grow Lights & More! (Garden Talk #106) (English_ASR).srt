00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,060
last week where he talked about growing

14
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:32,759
in Coco coir while he's back again for

this week he's going to talk all about

17
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,219
LED grow lights another area where his

18
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,079
knowledge goes deep not only does he

19
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,879
talk about LED grow lights versus other

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,100
types of lighting but he also gets into

21
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:45,419
things to look for in an LED grow light

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,399
he talks about the girl like calculator

23
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,500
he created talks about some of the best

24
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,320
LED grow lights on the market today here

25
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,460
in 2023 and so much more I do have a

26

quick announcement that I wanted to

27
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,960
mention before we get into the episode I

28
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:59,759
have launched a Clips Channel on YouTube

29
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,399
so basically these Garden Talk podcast

30
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,558
episodes will be cut down into smaller

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,359
Clips bite-sized chunks and they'll be

32
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,099
on that Clips Channel new clip every

33
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,500
single day so check out that channel

34
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:11,938
simply search Garden talk Clips I also

35
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,920
have a link in the YouTube description

36
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,959

of my goals for this podcast is to bring

38
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,759
free information about gardening all

39
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,739
plants to the general public that being

40
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,420
said I'd like to thank the sponsors of

different series LED grow lights the ion

45
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,780
board and the ion grid the ion board

46
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,259
fixtures are board style and use Samsung

47
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,840
LM 301b diodes while the ion grid series

48
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:46,438
has an open Center design and uses

49
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,240
Samsung lm301h diodes I'll have a link

50

in the description section below so you

51
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,099
can learn more about these grow lights

Talk podcast today I am joined with Dr

57
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:06,059
MJ Coco how you doing today I'm doing

58
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,699
great thanks for having me back on the

59
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,959
show yeah back to back episodes first

60
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,179
time we've ever done that on the garden

61
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,039
Talk podcast uh if you guys missed last

62
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,080
week's episode I sat down with Dr MJ

63
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,598
Coco and we talked about growing in

64
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,400
Cocoa a lot of good information and then

65
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:22,019
you also have a lot of knowledge when it

66
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,180
comes to LEDs that's what I want to get

67
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,459
into in this episode because really

68
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,560
Lighting in general I know we can narrow

69
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:31,020
down the focus lighting is such a broad

70
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,340
topic right so if we can narrow it down

71
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,020
to LEDs but I'm sure there's going to be

72
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,878
some overlapping with other lighting as

73
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,439
well but uh yeah looking forward to

74
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:41,459
picking your brain on this one

75
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:43,378
yeah it's you know understanding light

76
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,239
is something that a lot of farmers take

77
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:47,098
for granted because you're going

78
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,360
Outdoors Under the Sun

79
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:51,959
um it's something that I didn't think

80
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,940
about a whole lot until I became

81
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,479
um you know an indoor grower an indoor

82
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:59,219
growing you know understanding how to

83
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:02,280
deal with Horticultural lighting and

84
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:04,318
what we need to understand about it and

85
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,640
um you know how to effectively deploy it

86
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,299
as we were talking in the first episode

87
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:11,878
we did you know the the cost of running

88
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:15,719
those lights is just such a huge part of

89
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:18,479
sort of what we're doing as Growers that

90
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:21,840
really understanding what light is how

91
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,878
light works what we need how to get it

92
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,340
um can really improve the efficiency in

93
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:28,620
your grow definitely a key component of

94
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,479
the grow that is for sure so I'm excited

95
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,860
for this one but first can you introduce

96
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,199
yourself for those that didn't catch the

97
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,959
first episode we did together sure yeah

98
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:39,658
I'm Dr MJ Coco trying to just you know

99
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,158
share scientifically sound knowledge

100
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:46,139
about how to grow soilless and Beyond

101
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:48,298
just getting into growing in Cocoa like

102
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:51,658
we talked about last time

103
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:53,540
um you know how to grow effectively how

104
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:55,739
to understand the various aspects of

105
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:58,919
that are really sort of scientific

106
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:00,739
around being an effective indoor you

107
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,479
know doing effective indoor Horticulture

108
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:04,878
so not just sort of understanding

109
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,579
fertilization

110
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:11,459
root health you know irrigation those

111
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,900
kinds of issues different grow media

112
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,539
um but like we're talking about now

113
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,660
lighting is such a huge aspect of of

114
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:20,519
indoor Horticulture so and it's not you

115
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,400
know whether you're growing in in you

116
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,740
know living soil or rock wool or cocoa

117
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:28,500
or whatever other media

118
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,478
um you know it's applicable to All

119
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,060
Growers to to understand how to

120
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,339
effectively use light so

121
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,339
um

122
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:40,138
yeah that's my background I have a PhD

123
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:41,698
in

124
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,400
um Agricultural and economic

125
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:47,759
anthropology I worked with Farmers from

126
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:50,039
Central America and southern Mexico

127
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,979
um and really got into studying the the

128
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,020
science of indoor Horticulture

129
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:57,180
um right after I got back from doing my

130
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:59,039
dissertation field work and like I told

131
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,379
you last time you know kind of took that

132
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,620
same approach so

133
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:07,500
um training as a graduate student as a

134
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,720
professor and you know access to to

135
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,279
those materials and sort of that

136
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,500
background in terms of how to approach

137
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,019
this you know one of the things when I

138
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,779
really started getting into the online

139
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:21,899
growing Community

140
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:23,599
um was the amount of like bro science uh

141
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:26,939
the amount of sort of

142
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,900
things that weren't valid that a lot of

143
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:33,680
Growers believed in and still practice

144
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:37,739
um you know

145
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,620
more so in in certain online growing

146
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,600
communities than in others but I I

147
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,560
definitely saw the need to just sort of

148
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:49,020
provide accessible knowledge to Growers

149
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,560
that was scientifically valid

150
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:53,939
um so that's what I've tried to do and

151
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,439
you know getting into lighting was we're

152
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:56,939
going to get into today this has been my

153
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,478
my big project for the last several

154
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:01,860
years and it's something that gets me

155
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,978
excited I'm in the middle of testing

156
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,780
light right now actually so

157
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:09,300
um and doing that kind of primary

158
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:11,099
research basically doing my own tests

159
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,900
and understanding how lights work

160
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,600
because I get my hands on a lot of them

161
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:17,638
has been a really exciting part of of

162
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,560
learning about how lights work it's

163
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,939
exciting to me as well I know it's not

164
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,280
exciting for everybody but it's

165
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:24,899
certainly exciting for me let's start

166
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,299
off with the basics here I started

167
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:31,219
growing about 13 years ago and there was

168
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:34,379
no LEDs there was HPS MH and HBS

169
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,600
and flowering under HPS yes right yeah

170
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:39,478
exactly and then you know I got my first

171
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,759
led in 2015. and now it seems like

172
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:46,079
everybody's buying LEDs what was your

173
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,960
first led back in 2015. it was P9 xml2

174
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,339
by Platinum LED old school they're

175
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,959
actually a funny thing is they're still

176
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:54,299
selling that light today

177
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:58,099
it's like it was released in 2015 it's

178
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:00,960
like uh okay outdated but um okay

179
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,000
that whole Horticultural the revolution

180
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,279
that we've seen in the last 10 years in

181
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,538
Horticultural lighting but basically

182
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:11,818
from you know 2012 to 2022 or so was

183
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:13,199
just such an exciting and dynamic time

184
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:15,660
where

185
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,520
the whole industry just kind of flipped

186
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,439
on itself

187
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,939
um

188
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:24,180
LEDs not only sort of came to the

189
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:26,579
mainstream but became more efficient

190
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,740
um that was sort of the the first wave

191
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:31,560
was LEDs became more efficient than the

192
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,079
gas discharge lighting and then the

193
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,819
costs of the LEDs came down right and

194
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,279
that happened in sort of two distinct

195
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:42,360
movements

196
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:44,758
um like from 2012 to 2016 the capacity

197
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,240
for LEDs to really perform better than

198
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:50,340
the gas discharge lights like hit I mean

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,460
and it became obvious by the end of that

200
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:57,179
period that you know LEDs were were

201
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:59,459
better than than guest discharge lights

202
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,519
um but they were super expensive at that

203
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:04,258
point to get good ones there was a lot

204
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,818
of crappy ones that started entering the

205
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:08,639
market but to get good ones they were

206
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:11,879
really expensive and you know since like

207
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,379
2016 to 2022 that the prices have just

208
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,959
come down as as more and more

209
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:18,598
manufacturing has come online

210
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:21,359
um you know as the full spectrum dial in

211
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,978
particular have have found more

212
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,419
mainstream applications and been

213
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:27,000
manufactured in larger and larger

214
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:29,339
quantities that the unit prices dropped

215
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,379
significantly and that's allowed you

216
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:34,559
know all manufacturers to produce lights

217
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:37,139
that are like

218
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,019
you know even cheap lights these days

219
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:41,759
that now not all lights but you can

220
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,759
still get you can certainly get some

221
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,500
cheap lights on like Amazon that are

222
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,899
better than anything that was available

223
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,740
in 2016.

224
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:54,419
um better than you know your first cob

225
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,060
and they are still selling some of those

226
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:59,639
but it's just it's tremendous how we've

227
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:01,799
seen that sort of the the technology

228
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:04,379
progress and then the prices collapse

229
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:07,500
yeah I lived through that time as well

230
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:09,838
and it's it's crazy to see the way it

231
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,200
went let's uh let's start from the the

232
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,779
beginning here just Basics LEDs what are

233
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,019
they actually

234
00:09:14,778 --> 00:09:22,019
ladies are are you just make the use of

235
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:23,399
semiconductors so semiconductor is just

236
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,799
material that doesn't conduct

237
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,679
electricity well it conducts electricity

238
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:30,059
sort of somewhat it's semi-conductive

239
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:32,039
and that's why it's called a

240
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:33,199
semiconductor

241
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:36,559
um

242
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,540
LEDs in particular use a PN type

243
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,399
semiconductor where

244
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:45,360
um you know electrons are basically

245
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:49,320
pushed from p-type material to n-type

246
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:53,039
material and as they cross that juncture

247
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,800
um the electrons are forced to to

248
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,620
descend in orbit

249
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:03,079
um as they descend in orbit they lose

250
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,080
energy and we can

251
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:10,500
we can by selecting the right

252
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:12,839
semiconductor materials sort of make the

253
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:16,620
electron lose the right amount of energy

254
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:20,640
and it will produce a photon of a

255
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:22,379
specific amount of energy so you know a

256
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:26,458
semiconductor basically we just push

257
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:27,899
electricity through this material and as

258
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,699
the electrons and I'm sorry they move

259
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:32,879
from the n-type to the p-type material

260
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:35,459
as they move across there they release

261
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:37,200
this energy that is in the form of an

262
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:40,919
electron

263
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:46,200
um each semiconductor will

264
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:48,179
lead to a specific drop in energy so as

265
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,060
it moves from the n-type to the p-type

266
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:53,819
it's got to you know drop so many band

267
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:57,000
levels basically and that determines how

268
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,519
much energy it has to release and that

269
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,860
determines the wavelength of the photon

270
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,839
that's created different wavelengths

271
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,480
photons have different sort of amounts

272
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,579
of energy in them so if there's a lot of

273
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,399
energy in the photon then it's going to

274
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:13,139
be blue or ultraviolet if there's less

275
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,019
energy in the photon then it's going to

276
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:19,439
be red or infrared

277
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:21,899
um and every single Photon that comes

278
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,720
out of a semiconductor is going to have

279
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:27,379
basically the same amount of energy and

280
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,519
B basically the same wavelength because

281
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:31,860
that's determined by the specific

282
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,740
materials that are used in the pnn type

283
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:39,000
material sort of how far that electron

284
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,778
has to drop as it crosses the junction

285
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,940
um

286
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:44,100
if you get deeper and deeper into that

287
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,260
but it gets sort of deeper and deeper

288
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,300
into

289
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:50,039
quite literally theoretical physics well

290
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:51,659
we will get too deep into it I want to

291
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:54,179
go over some of these beginners heads

292
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:57,360
here but uh appreciate the explanation

293
00:11:54,179 --> 00:12:00,359
that's it so electricity sort of gets

294
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,300
pushed through a semiconductor and

295
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,879
energy is released by by controlling the

296
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:08,278
materials in the semiconductor we can

297
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:10,679
tune it up so that almost all of the

298
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:12,958
energy that's released comes off as

299
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:16,139
light because it could also come off as

300
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:18,599
heat so that's one area where different

301
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:22,139
kinds of semiconductors

302
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,820
um are more or less efficient and in you

303
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,379
know that first part of the sort of

304
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,260
historical Trend right when we're going

305
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:31,679
from like 2012 to 2016.

306
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:33,899
um we saw tremendous gains in the

307
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,179
semiconductor materials that were used

308
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,700
to really make it so more and more of

309
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:40,859
the energy was being released as light

310
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,259
and less and less of the energy was

311
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,839
being released as heat

312
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:49,379
um and that's really how semiconductors

313
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:52,019
became so much more sort of efficient at

314
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:58,439
this point the 450 nanometer

315
00:12:52,019 --> 00:13:00,179
semiconductors are 90 efficient so 90 of

316
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,380
the power that we drive to them and this

317
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:07,319
is blue 450 nanometers

318
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:11,939
90 percent of the energy that sort of is

319
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:14,100
consumed is blue light becomes Blue

320
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,100
Light Energy

321
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,560
um and laws of physics suggest that you

322
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,420
know we can't we can't get more than a

323
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:23,458
hundred percent of the energy consumed

324
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:26,519
to be blue light energy right so we're

325
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:28,199
already at 90 percent so LEDs those

326
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,360
semiconductors especially the blue

327
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:34,500
semiconductors are becoming are sort of

328
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:37,680
reaching the maximum of efficiency what

329
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,958
we could ever expect out of any lighting

330
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,299
technology so a lot of Growers outside

331
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:44,399
what's next and you know isn't there

332
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:47,299
going to be some new Revolution that

333
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,860
like replaces LEDs and gets us you know

334
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:50,819
LEDs are twice as good as HPS is

335
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,620
something else going to come along

336
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,920
that's going to be twice as good as LEDs

337
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:58,200
no it can't happen it's violational laws

338
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:01,559
of physics LEDs like HPS was 40

339
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,480
efficient and LEDs and like you know 80

340
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,518
percent efficient some of the blue chips

341
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,120
like I just said are up to 90 efficient

342
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:12,120
we're running out of room to to continue

343
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,000
to sort of grow that that's interesting

344
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,560
now what about the Spectrum I know the

345
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,360
Spectrum you can get with LEDs it can be

346
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,039
different than a lot the traditional HPS

347
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,680
for example a lot of people claim that

348
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:26,219
the HPS is a close closer Spectrum to

349
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:27,899
the Sun than any LED is talk to us about

350
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,660
like the Spectrum differences between

351
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,799
LEDs what you can get out of LEDs versus

352
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:34,500
what you can get out of some of the

353
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:37,439
other traditional lighting so each each

354
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:41,458
semiconductor creates one wavelength of

355
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,579
light that's it so 660 nanometer you

356
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:47,638
know semiconductor it creates

357
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:49,620
photons from like 655 to 665 nanometers

358
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:53,639
but they're all right in this really

359
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:57,240
narrow little range of spectrum right

360
00:14:53,639 --> 00:15:00,299
um the 450 nanometer semiconductors are

361
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,820
almost exactly at 450 so like every

362
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:05,159
Photon coming out of that they're

363
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,480
monochromatic they create one color of

364
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,039
light

365
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,320
um and and you know the earlier

366
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:16,259
generations of LEDs used blue diodes and

367
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,300
they used red diodes and in sorry

368
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:20,399
conjunction

369
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:22,078
um and that's why because you have

370
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,879
semiconductors that create blue light

371
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:27,059
and you have semiconductors they create

372
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:29,899
red light there are no semiconductors

373
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:33,119
that create quote-unquote white light

374
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:36,120
white light is the combination of

375
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,419
several different Spectra so you have

376
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,419
photons at different wavelengths all can

377
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:45,000
coming together that create white light

378
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:47,519
and interestingly you don't need a lot

379
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,440
of all of the different lights you can

380
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,839
have a lot of red and a lot of blue as

381
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,139
long as you have some greens and yellows

382
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,779
the light looks pretty why if you only

383
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:59,698
have red and blue the light looks

384
00:15:57,778 --> 00:16:00,958
blurple and you know Growers that have

385
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:02,578
been around the block for a few years

386
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,039
and then what purple light looks like

387
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:07,019
it's it's not sort of a

388
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,458
it's certainly not white and it's not

389
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,959
pleasant you can't really see your

390
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,638
plants under it very well and that was

391
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:14,638
one of the big problems with with purple

392
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:18,000
light so what they do to create white

393
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:22,259
light or white diodes is they start with

394
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,919
the 450 nanometer blue semiconductor and

395
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:28,019
then they use phosphor in the glue that

396
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,958
sort of holds that semiconductor and

397
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:33,899
that phosphor distributes the the energy

398
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:36,539
to the other spectral Brands so they're

399
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:38,399
able to sort of

400
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:40,679
what you're basically doing there blue

401
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,458
photons at 450 nanometers have a lot of

402
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:47,219
energy red photons sit like 650 to 700

403
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:49,500
nanometers have less energy so when you

404
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,720
push those blue photons through a media

405
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,000
like phosphor that strips them of some

406
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,060
of their energy some of those photons

407
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,578
become redder and it sort of diffuses

408
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:03,179
the light through the Spectrum to create

409
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:06,678
that white tint now all

410
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:10,500
full spectrum diodes are heavy on blue

411
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:13,798
because they are blue semiconductors so

412
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,779
if you look at the spectral output sort

413
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:18,298
of diagram of what the diodes produce

414
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:20,879
they all have a strong Peak at 450

415
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:23,099
nanometers because they're using 450

416
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,459
nanometer semiconductors to create the

417
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:27,719
light sort of in the first place right

418
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:31,980
um and then they'll have a secondary

419
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:35,400
Peak out usually at 650 660 in the high

420
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:39,240
600s there which is where most of the

421
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,940
photons got sort of filtered to as they

422
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,339
pass through the the phosphor

423
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,840
um but some photons will land in the

424
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:49,019
middle and these are green and yellow

425
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:51,480
Spectrum so you know as you're throwing

426
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:54,900
a bunch of photons out towards the high

427
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:59,339
600s you end up with some in the 400 or

428
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:02,400
the high 400s 500s lows 600s even out to

429
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:05,459
the 700s and and sort of Beyond some

430
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,980
photons get sort of slowed down more

431
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,960
they're not not slowed down stripped of

432
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,558
more energy

433
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,019
um

434
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:16,500
because all photons travel at the speed

435
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:18,538
of light right some like longer

436
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,919
wavelength photons travel at the speedo

437
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:21,779
so they get from like this side of the

438
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,799
screen to this side of the screen like

439
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:30,480
that right just like maybe one wave

440
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:33,119
um like 800 nanometer or you know 650

441
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,640
nanometer but then you get like 450

442
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,798
nanometer right

443
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,980
um 300 nanometer you have to like start

444
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:42,779
vibrating more in the same space now

445
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,058
every single Photon gets from here to

446
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:47,579
here in the same amount of time so if

447
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:50,038
you have to do 20 vibrations that's more

448
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:52,619
energy than if you only have to do one

449
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:55,259
vibration in that time right so blue

450
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:57,359
photons vibrate faster than red photons

451
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,220
in that case but they all travel at the

452
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,219
speed of light

453
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:07,319
um so

454
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:10,140
that's one side they now light like

455
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:13,079
um HPS

456
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,120
um or the the other you know gas

457
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:19,500
discharge lights

458
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:23,279
they create light in a different way and

459
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:27,480
they basically heat up elements

460
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:30,058
um that they create different gases and

461
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,579
then they bombard those gases with

462
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:35,720
electrons

463
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:40,918
as the electrons hit different gases

464
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:43,259
they gain energy and then as they fall

465
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:46,259
back down to their original energy level

466
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:48,480
they release photons and since those

467
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:50,579
collisions happen somewhat chaotically

468
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,019
that you know they go to different

469
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:56,899
heights and they fall down at different

470
00:19:52,019 --> 00:20:01,200
heights so they create a blend of

471
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:03,360
photons across different Spectra and to

472
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,058
change the Spectrum in gas discharge

473
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,459
lighting you change the the gaseous

474
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:09,720
elements that are going to be vaporized

475
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,880
so

476
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,880
um you know

477
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:17,760
sodium and different

478
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,740
um Mercury and different things can be

479
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,660
vaporized and bombarded that's the way

480
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,720
fluorescent lights work too fluorescent

481
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:27,000
lights vaporize Mercury and then bombard

482
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,980
it with photons and it's the photons

483
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,140
sort of hit it they gain energy and when

484
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:34,380
a photon or when an electron sorry with

485
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:38,940
an electron loses energy it will release

486
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:40,740
a photon that energy becomes a photon

487
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,840
so that's one side of it very different

488
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,839
the other thing we can do with LEDs is

489
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:48,720
we can Target Spectra so we can create a

490
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:52,259
diode at 660 nanometers and grow lights

491
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,259
all use not all but almost all of them

492
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:57,359
use 660 nanometer diodes because you

493
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:59,640
know the full spectrum are really 450

494
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:02,099
nanometer diodes that are throwing some

495
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,679
portion of their energy out to the red

496
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:08,240
but not enough they're strong in blue

497
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:12,780
and sort of weaker and red so grow light

498
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:16,620
manufacturers add red to their you know

499
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:19,798
ad specific red diodes which are Super

500
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:23,519
efficient the the red diodes are only

501
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:27,440
like 70 percent energy efficient

502
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:30,839
but since red photons have less energy

503
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,298
you actually get more photons per watt

504
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:36,418
with a red diode than you do with the

505
00:21:33,298 --> 00:21:41,279
blue diode so like the best blue diodes

506
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:46,280
are like 3.2 3.3 like the best blue

507
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:49,399
diodes 3.2 3.3 micro moles of photons

508
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:53,220
per walk of energy

509
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:57,360
the best red 660 nanometer photons are

510
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:59,480
over four micro moles of photons per

511
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,500
watt of energy

512
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,679
even though they're less energy

513
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:08,400
efficient so basically four micro moles

514
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:12,960
worth of red photons have less energy

515
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:16,440
than three micro moles of blue photons

516
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,720
but plants don't really care about that

517
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,000
the plants care about how many photons

518
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,579
are hitting them plants care less about

519
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,759
sort of how much energy is in each

520
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:29,939
individual Photon plants respond just as

521
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:32,158
well to a red Photon as they do to a

522
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:35,220
blue Photon so one thing we're able to

523
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,799
do with LEDs is give them more red

524
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:40,919
photons which we're able to make to

525
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:43,319
create really efficiently

526
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:45,960
um and you know sort of Spike our

527
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:48,599
efficiency numbers by by targeting the

528
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,640
red photons with you know a specific

529
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,918
semiconductor that very efficiently

530
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,740
creates those photons and they're not

531
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:58,440
filtered through anything

532
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:01,200
um that gas discharge if you want to

533
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,720
change the the Spectrum you either

534
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,120
change the the elements that are getting

535
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,759
heated in that the the electrons are are

536
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:11,099
colliding with where you filter the

537
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:13,879
light with various things and anytime

538
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:19,079
you filter the light you lose efficiency

539
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:22,919
so the ability of LEDs to create any

540
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:26,038
specific spectrum of light is one of

541
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:28,140
LEDs significant advantages really

542
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:29,819
because we can Target things

543
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,340
I think

544
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:34,200
we need to at least mention the other

545
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:38,939
side of this which is sort of like what

546
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:41,100
spectrum do we want for different plants

547
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,620
um what what spectrum are we trying to

548
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:46,980
create and

549
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:49,319
you know that there's still some really

550
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:51,298
exciting research on that really

551
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:53,700
exciting Research into how much far red

552
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:55,500
light might be beneficial for plants for

553
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:58,798
example

554
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:02,519
um but the best research suggests that

555
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:06,240
plants want at least a distribution of

556
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:08,819
light energy sources such that you know

557
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,519
the purples weren't terrible in that

558
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:13,200
they did Target sort of the 450 and the

559
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,538
650

560
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:20,279
um ranges so they weren't sort of just

561
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:24,119
Drilling in on one photo system

562
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:26,339
um they're activating both and you know

563
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:28,939
plants do better really with a full

564
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:31,079
spectrum light but they're most

565
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,659
photosynthetically responsive to the

566
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:35,759
blue light into the red light adding

567
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:38,460
green and yellow light the primary

568
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:41,339
importance of that is for us as Growers

569
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:44,640
to be able to see our plants better if

570
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:47,759
we grow just under blurple blue and and

571
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,759
red light it's really hard to identify

572
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,980
like plant nutrient deficiencies pest

573
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,379
issues overall plant health issues

574
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:58,200
because you just don't get to see your

575
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:00,960
plant very well but in terms of

576
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:04,620
photosynthetic response plants grown

577
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,298
under blurple lights do pretty well

578
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:08,459
um vis-a-vis plants grown Under full

579
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:10,679
spectrum lights during the vegetative

580
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,779
growth

581
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:14,400
um

582
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:17,339
plants growing under monochromatic light

583
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,280
so only blue or only red light don't do

584
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:23,639
very well during vegetative growth

585
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:27,480
and during flowering or reproductive

586
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:30,799
growth for most plants there's less

587
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:34,558
significance on Spectrum

588
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:37,079
more significance on flocks so how much

589
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:40,079
light the plant is harvesting as opposed

590
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:43,139
to what specific sorry qualities the

591
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:46,220
lights are I know a lot of Growers think

592
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:49,440
that the specific spectrum that you give

593
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:51,480
especially during the flowering phase is

594
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,940
going to be sort of the key to harvest

595
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,659
quality or to getting the best out of

596
00:25:53,940 --> 00:26:00,240
your plants we don't have really any

597
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:02,100
scientific research to to support those

598
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,579
beliefs all the research that's been

599
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:08,219
done on flowering plants and altering

600
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:10,500
the Spectrum really suggests that

601
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:13,500
altering the Spectrum has almost no

602
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:16,019
impact on on harvest yield or harvest

603
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:19,558
quality we do know that during

604
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:22,200
vegetative growth plants will respond

605
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:24,778
differently to to Red heavy Spectra

606
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:28,140
versus blue heavy Spectra so if we

607
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:30,798
redshift our vegetating light then the

608
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:33,480
plants will grow lankier

609
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:35,519
evolutionarily red light is usually

610
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,380
filtered through something so it sends

611
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,000
the signal to the plants that you're

612
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:42,360
growing under somebody else you better

613
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,659
kind of get taller and get up above them

614
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:48,058
um so they they try to stretch more

615
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:50,039
often in a way that we as Growers don't

616
00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:51,839
want they become too sort of stretched

617
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:55,079
out and lanky so so we don't want to put

618
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:57,359
them under too much red light that's why

619
00:26:55,079 --> 00:27:00,119
back in the days that we did HPS and

620
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:02,579
metal halide we'd veg under metal halide

621
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,379
it's not because metal halide were

622
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:07,079
better it's because metal halide have

623
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:09,360
less red in them and the plants wouldn't

624
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:11,519
sort of grow too much a lot of Growers

625
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:14,759
got the idea that we switched to HPS

626
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,019
because like HPS was better Spectrum for

627
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:18,778
flowering

628
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:21,058
that's really not true HPS are more

629
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:23,159
efficient than metal halide

630
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:26,579
um and plants don't really care what

631
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:30,360
spectrum they're flowered under so if we

632
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:32,759
veg plants under HPS they grow too lanky

633
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:34,918
so that was the problem so we'd veg

634
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:36,960
plants under metal halide and then we'd

635
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,299
switch them to HPS because HPS is more

636
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,000
efficient not necessarily because it's

637
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:44,220
going to produce sort of better Harvest

638
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,079
quality it would produce higher yields

639
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,600
but the higher yield was because of the

640
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:52,740
increase in efficiency

641
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:54,839
for the same sort of wattage output

642
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,480
um so I I just want to say that we want

643
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,379
to distribute the light

644
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,058
understanding something about Spectrum

645
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,299
especially during vegetative plants

646
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:05,460
vegetating growth is important but I

647
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:08,400
think a lot of Growers sort of think

648
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,340
that there's some magic in Spectrum

649
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,900
during flowering

650
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:14,579
we don't have anything in sort of the

651
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,740
scientific data that suggests that

652
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:18,480
that's really the case I appreciate you

653
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,759
getting into so much detail in regards

654
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,980
to Spectrum and uh clarifying some

655
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:26,158
things that were incorrect over the

656
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,960
years now let's get into kind of what to

657
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,100
look for in an LED grow light there are

658
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,960
so many different things that you can

659
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:33,298
look for I know you created a grow light

660
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,759
calculator which is awesome hoping you

661
00:28:33,298 --> 00:28:37,859
can talk about that here but um you know

662
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,720
what should folks be looking for since

663
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:41,639
you mentioned Spectrum we already

664
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,140
already talked about that as something

665
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,140
to look at and what to look at within

666
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,179
the Spectrum but par efficiency of the

667
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,559
fixture I'm even going and on what are

668
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:50,700
the kind of like the top things people

669
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:51,599
should look for because there are so

670
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,519
many different things people get

671
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,259
confused used pretty easily when it

672
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,058
comes to shopping for an LED grow light

673
00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:58,980
so so break it down for us

674
00:28:57,058 --> 00:29:01,019
so first we just got to break light into

675
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,419
two parts light is a particle a light is

676
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:05,278
a wave so far we've been talking about

677
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:07,640
light as a wave we've been talking about

678
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:10,079
Spectrum we're talking about different

679
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,419
nanometers of wavelength red light

680
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:16,079
versus blue light how all that that's

681
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:17,220
all light as a wave light is also a

682
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,278
particle

683
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:23,159
photons and what really matters that

684
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:25,079
side flux what we call flux the the

685
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:27,360
amount of photons basically that are

686
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:28,980
hitting the plant the amount of radiated

687
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,418
energy that's going to be hitting the

688
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:33,599
plant

689
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:37,020
um it that's more important for almost

690
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,398
all reasons than Spectrum I think a lot

691
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:39,720
of girls get caught up thinking about

692
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,298
spectrum and they think about different

693
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,640
colors of light and all of this but the

694
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:46,980
overall amount of light is what

695
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,320
ultimately really matters almost every

696
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:52,079
grow light has a decent enough Spectrum

697
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:54,119
I don't I don't sort of knock a lot of

698
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,158
grow lights because they have a terrible

699
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:57,359
Spectrum but I'll certainly knock them

700
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,520
because they don't produce enough

701
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:02,178
photons so they don't have enough

702
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,879
efficiency in in producing their photons

703
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:07,919
so we want to talk about counting

704
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,860
photons and understanding how many

705
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,360
photons your grow light will sort of

706
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:14,158
produce because there's a number when

707
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:17,219
we're talking about micro moles we're

708
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:21,539
talking about a number of photons so

709
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:24,538
think of it as a quantity of light so

710
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:26,960
every every grow light can produce a

711
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:31,200
certain quantity of light per second

712
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:34,679
okay and that's what we call the ppf the

713
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,558
photosynthetic Photon flux

714
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:39,000
um that total amount of light that's

715
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:42,298
created per second there's different

716
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,819
ways to measure it you can just say hey

717
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:47,819
I'm using these diodes that get you know

718
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:52,379
3.2 micromoles per watt and I got a

719
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:54,720
hundred Watts so I got 320 microballs

720
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,760
you could just do a calculation like

721
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,298
that right a lot of grow light companies

722
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:02,278
do exactly that and when you see a

723
00:31:00,298 --> 00:31:05,158
number often advertised for their ppf

724
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:07,679
that's just a a calculation of what the

725
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:09,179
diode could theoretically do times the

726
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,220
number of Watts that are being driven

727
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:14,580
through this fixture and it's kind of BS

728
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:18,058
because it's not reality

729
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:19,798
so we call that the calculated ppf right

730
00:31:18,058 --> 00:31:21,418
because it's not measured it's just what

731
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:24,480
they do based on the published numbers

732
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:25,799
or the components that they're using

733
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,659
um the other thing we could do to

734
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:29,460
measure the amount of light that a grow

735
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:31,140
light fixture creates is we could stick

736
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:35,100
it in a device called an integrating

737
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:38,700
sphere in an integrating sphere measures

738
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:42,418
what we call the total ppf it actually

739
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,919
counts each Photon that comes out of

740
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:46,620
that fixture each and every Photon no

741
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,659
matter where it goes basically unless it

742
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:50,579
hits the grow light fixture itself

743
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:52,500
because it's in the integrating sphere

744
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:53,879
and gets like a converted to heat by

745
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,740
hitting the gray light fixture itself

746
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,559
it's going to be counted by the

747
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:02,339
integrating sphere so we call that the

748
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:04,740
total ppf and a lot of better grow light

749
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:06,959
manufacturers will sort of have their

750
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,419
lights sphere tested and then they'll

751
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,179
report a sphere test number usually out

752
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:13,620
to two or three decimal places so if you

753
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:15,240
see a sphere test number they're going

754
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:16,398
to advertise something like our fixture

755
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,798
gets

756
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:21,719
2.379 micromoles per per Joule they're

757
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:22,798
not just going to say like 3.4 or

758
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,200
whatever they're getting they're going

759
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,519
to sort of have that

760
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,038
sort of finer granularity because they

761
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:30,119
actually ran a test and they actually

762
00:32:28,038 --> 00:32:30,898
have something that they're reporting

763
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:35,099
there

764
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:36,839
but we don't grow our plants in a sphere

765
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:38,519
um you know we don't grow our plants on

766
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:40,319
the inside of an integrating sphere we

767
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:44,579
grow our plants usually in a grow tent

768
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:47,038
so a sphere is an over count of how many

769
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:50,220
photons will actually hit your plants in

770
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:52,500
a grow tent so if you want a better

771
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:54,960
understanding of sort of what a grow

772
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:57,898
light is going to be able to deliver to

773
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,380
the canopy of your garden then you want

774
00:32:57,898 --> 00:33:04,019
to look at a par test result

775
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:07,740
um a well set up par test can measure

776
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:10,139
what we call the usable ppf and the

777
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,538
usable ppf is the number of photons that

778
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,100
actually are going to hit the plants in

779
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:16,200
your grow

780
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:19,619
um that's what I try to measure in my

781
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:22,798
par tests so you set up a fixture and

782
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:24,839
the way it could be used and then you

783
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:27,599
measure how many photons actually arrive

784
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:30,839
to the the canopy of that space so what

785
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:33,178
we're doing there is we're using a

786
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:37,259
Quantum sentence you're a par sensor

787
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:40,620
which is actually measuring ppf D the d

788
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:42,960
stands for density so we're not the

789
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:44,879
sensor doesn't count the total number of

790
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,259
them it doesn't know the total number of

791
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,140
them it just knows the number that are

792
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:51,658
hitting the sensor and it says well this

793
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:54,419
is how dense the photons are they're

794
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:57,179
basically hitting this sensor if we take

795
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:59,580
a good sample across a par test like

796
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:02,460
that then we can extrapolate from that

797
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:04,558
density across the area the size of the

798
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,380
area that we know and that gets us to

799
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:09,000
the quantity the overall quantity of

800
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,139
light

801
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,280
um

802
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:17,399
there's a lot into ppf but ppf whether

803
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:21,119
it's calculated ppf whether it's total

804
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:24,480
ppf or whether it's usable ppf are

805
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:27,659
metrics to describe the total amount of

806
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,418
light that a fixture will produce and

807
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:33,119
and that's what our calculator sort of

808
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:35,519
fundamentally works with because the the

809
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:39,300
amount of light that a grow light

810
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:43,378
fixture creates determines how much area

811
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:46,440
that grow light can cover at a given

812
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:49,618
density you know a density of light so

813
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:54,838
if you have a thousand micro moles

814
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:57,900
of light and you want 500 micromoles per

815
00:34:54,838 --> 00:35:00,358
square meter of density

816
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,400
and you had perfect distribution which

817
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:04,440
isn't realistic but just to say you had

818
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,800
perfect distribution then you could grow

819
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:11,039
with two square meters right because you

820
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,839
have a thousand micro moles divided by

821
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:15,480
two square meters would be 500

822
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:18,179
micromoles per square meter that micro

823
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,099
moles per square meter is the ppfd

824
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:22,199
measurement

825
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:23,420
um and that's basically how we go from

826
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:26,279
an amount

827
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:29,400
of light we have an idea of how much

828
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,859
density we want to grow with what the

829
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,320
plants can tolerate and so how much

830
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:36,239
space a different grow light will be

831
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,338
able to cover

832
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:41,098
um the grow light calculator sort of

833
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:45,059
works with those numbers so if a grow

834
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:47,940
light will tell you something like

835
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:49,739
this girl that gets 2.8 micromoles per

836
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,720
Joule and that might be all you know

837
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:54,899
about the gorilla you should assume that

838
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:57,358
that number is a calculated PP PPE

839
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:00,180
that's photosynthetic Photon efficacy

840
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:03,059
but it relates to

841
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:06,779
um ppf which is the total amount of

842
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:09,119
photons so you can take that 2.8 over to

843
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:12,119
our grow light calculator take that 2.8

844
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:15,358
and plug that into the the micro moles

845
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:17,940
per Joule tag and then how many watts

846
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:20,279
does it grow light say it has it's a you

847
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,500
know 100 watt light

848
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,079
um just for simplistic reasons so you'd

849
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:27,239
put that in the in the watt field and

850
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,700
then you put the the cost which it just

851
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:31,559
needs to do the cost efficiency and then

852
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:33,838
you'd be able to select is this total

853
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:36,179
ppf do I think that they actually did a

854
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:37,799
sphere test I'll call it total PP after

855
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:39,358
I think that this is just a number that

856
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,400
they calculated you know I'll call it

857
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:43,199
calculated ppf

858
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,260
um and the calculator will make its own

859
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:48,899
conversions based on all right if that's

860
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:51,359
calculated ppf this is what we would

861
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:54,240
expect it to be able to do in terms of

862
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:55,980
usable ppf that's one of the big things

863
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,500
that the calculator does is convert

864
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,000
between those different types of ppf and

865
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,300
then some actually more simple

866
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,519
calculations about how much area could

867
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,099
this grow light cover how much could you

868
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:11,519
reasonably expect to harvest from such a

869
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:13,740
grow light because all of that really is

870
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:16,139
a function of the amount of light that

871
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:18,899
you're you're providing to your plan so

872
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:21,440
we can have a fairly good estimate of

873
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,460
your Harvest potential not your sort of

874
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,159
guarantee that you'll actually hit that

875
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:28,740
but what your Harvest potential is how

876
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:31,019
much coverage you could get

877
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:33,659
um and break down you know how efficient

878
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:35,338
the the light is and whether or not it's

879
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:37,679
a good deal so that's what the the

880
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:39,719
calculator is designed to do and and

881
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:41,219
that's it the number one thing if you're

882
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:42,598
out there shopping for a grow light that

883
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:44,699
I think you should pay attention to is

884
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:46,859
the parmap

885
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:48,299
um you see because the department talks

886
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:50,460
about the actual light that's hitting

887
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,940
the canopy those those numbers that you

888
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:57,539
see in a par map are the ppfd numbers so

889
00:37:53,940 --> 00:38:00,059
the density of photons at each position

890
00:37:57,539 --> 00:38:03,239
across that map

891
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:05,219
um good distribution you don't want to

892
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,719
grow most Growers don't want to put

893
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:08,819
unless you're supplementing carbon

894
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,618
dioxide you're not going to want to put

895
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:14,160
your plants under more than a thousand

896
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:17,700
micro malls of ppfd

897
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:19,739
um light basically and even though you

898
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:23,460
can go outside in the Noonday sun and

899
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:25,618
measure the Sun at about 2 000 ppfd you

900
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:29,579
don't want to grow plants indoors under

901
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:31,559
a steady light source from higher than a

902
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:34,339
thousand ppfd because they will have

903
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:36,539
light toxicity issues if you do

904
00:38:34,338 --> 00:38:38,639
supplementing CO2 can get a little bit

905
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:41,039
higher than that so if you're evaluating

906
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:42,719
a par map make sure that the numbers in

907
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:45,300
the middle of the power map aren't above

908
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:47,639
a thousand it if they are that's not a

909
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,859
realistic map it's also not a realistic

910
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:51,838
map if they're like 500 you'd probably

911
00:38:49,858 --> 00:38:54,480
want more light than that so try to find

912
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:56,940
a power map with the center value is

913
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,440
close to a thousand and when the center

914
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:02,220
value is close to a thousand you want

915
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:04,760
the corners to be at least 500.

916
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:08,039
um that's a good distribution of light

917
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:12,359
no no hot spot higher than a thousand

918
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:13,739
and the lowest areas are at least 500.

919
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:15,598
um and that's sort of what I try to

920
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:17,338
evaluate in my par test now make sure

921
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,260
that it's a Well set up par test there's

922
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:22,139
any number of ways that manufacturers

923
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:24,900
can sort of goose the numbers on their

924
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:27,239
own tests so where possible use the

925
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:30,059
third party test or at least be

926
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,379
confident in how how they set it up that

927
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:33,119
makes sense yeah I'm looking at your

928
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,440
grow light calculator on your website

929
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,420
right now and I remember when you first

930
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,338
came out with us this was awesome one

931
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,559
thing I really like about it is if you

932
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:42,119
put the cost in there you can see what

933
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,338
the cost efficiency is like how much

934
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:45,900
you're paying per micromole that's cool

935
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:47,519
because you know if you're paying

936
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,039
outrageous price for it then the

937
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:52,139
fixtures is just not worth it

938
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:54,119
relationship there right in in these

939
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:56,338
days that's the best way to evaluate the

940
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:58,380
cost of a grow light too is the cost per

941
00:39:56,338 --> 00:40:00,420
microball because what you're buying is

942
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:03,420
a light creating machine so how much

943
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:06,000
light can it create and then you know

944
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:08,760
divide that by the purchase cost is what

945
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,519
we do for cost efficiency so say a light

946
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:15,060
that can create 600 micro malls that

947
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:16,440
costs you know two hundred dollars that

948
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:21,119
would be a tremendous deal that would be

949
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,920
like you know 33 cents per micro Mall

950
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,440
um which there are some lights that that

951
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,920
are getting towards that range down into

952
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,720
the the 30 cents per micro Mall you know

953
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,059
when we started when I did the grow

954
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,699
light calculator and we considered

955
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:38,880
anything under a dollar to be a good

956
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:40,379
deal right and this is the the sort of

957
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,358
price drop that we were talking about

958
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:45,599
and the efficiency gain had already

959
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:47,358
happened but you go back to like 2016

960
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,820
2017 2018

961
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:54,119
if you could find grow light that got

962
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:57,300
better than two micromoles per watt and

963
00:40:54,119 --> 00:41:00,059
you could find them but not that was

964
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:02,880
less than two micromorphs per dollar or

965
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:04,858
two dollars per micro Mall basically

966
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,480
um and now you can get them for like 40

967
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:08,519
or 50 cents

968
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,559
per micro Mall

969
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:12,539
um some of the the best deals out there

970
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:16,199
like on sales and stuff are down in the

971
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:18,239
30 cents per micro mole so the prices

972
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:21,419
have been basically cut in the third

973
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:24,539
over the last four or five years

974
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:26,099
um really sort of tremendous yeah it's

975
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:28,559
really incredible to see that huge price

976
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:29,820
drop and it's a lot better for consumers

977
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:32,519
of course because they're spending less

978
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:36,300
money on these grow lights it's pretty

979
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:38,519
new problems four or five years ago I

980
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,380
could basically assume when I'd start

981
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:44,099
talking to a grower that they were under

982
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:46,440
lit every grower was under lit didn't

983
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:48,780
have really enough light it's really

984
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:52,139
actually hard to be fully lit with HPS

985
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:54,420
lighting because it the you know it's

986
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:56,699
just one bulb in the center and that the

987
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,858
reflectors aren't that great and it

988
00:41:56,699 --> 00:42:00,419
creates that Central Hot Spot and it's

989
00:41:58,858 --> 00:42:02,639
just hard to get sort of a good

990
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,858
distribution of light so you'd always

991
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,480
sort of end up with you know good light

992
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:07,980
in the middle and crappy light towards

993
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,199
the corners if you were in a single

994
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:13,320
fixture space

995
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:15,059
um and and Growers under LEDs four or

996
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:18,119
five years ago man they were they were

997
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:21,599
all buying the the lies that this 100

998
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:23,400
watt light was a thousand watt HPS

999
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,940
replacement or whatever and everybody

1000
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:30,660
was under lit but since the efficiency's

1001
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:33,420
gone up and the prices come down more

1002
00:42:30,659 --> 00:42:35,819
and more Growers are not only full lit

1003
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,980
but they have the capacity we want to be

1004
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:40,559
a grower that's fully lit but you have

1005
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:42,179
the the capacity to be over lit and to

1006
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,400
be actually I mean I I'm running into

1007
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:47,219
more and more Growers now that are are

1008
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,559
creating light talks situations

1009
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:51,659
um for their plants so that that used to

1010
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:54,179
not be a thing really I mean especially

1011
00:42:51,659 --> 00:42:56,159
amongst home Growers it it wasn't a

1012
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:58,019
thing to be sort of bleaching your buds

1013
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:59,759
because you actually unless you wear HPS

1014
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:02,400
and you knew you were too close to the

1015
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,300
mhps but not just because like you had

1016
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,980
too much LED light in your tent so it's

1017
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,980
it's crazy how that's happened but

1018
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:13,079
Growers can definitely be fully lit and

1019
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,838
we're seeing home Growers pull down

1020
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:17,640
tremendous numbers because you know

1021
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:21,719
they're great distribution of light

1022
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:24,779
across their their tents and really you

1023
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:26,818
know good numbers not too much heat

1024
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,500
either just sort of the other side of

1025
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:31,019
that so you talk to us about things you

1026
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:34,019
can look for in an LED grow light let's

1027
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:36,420
talk Brands so you either of us are have

1028
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:38,159
any exclusive relationships with LED

1029
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:40,440
grow light company so we're free to talk

1030
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,539
about whatever Brands we want however we

1031
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,940
want to talk about them which is uh

1032
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:46,679
fantastic here so let's talk Brands what

1033
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:49,800
is someone like the top brands or model

1034
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:51,419
lights here in 2023 that you recommend

1035
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,519
people to check out

1036
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:56,220
it kind of depends on your price point

1037
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:58,380
to be perfectly honest with you

1038
00:43:56,219 --> 00:44:00,539
um I definitely think there's ways to to

1039
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:02,579
waste a lot of money on lights

1040
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:04,920
um I think there's a lot of expensive

1041
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:07,740
lights on the market that

1042
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,200
for me don't justify the return on

1043
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:13,858
investment I mean there is no return on

1044
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:15,480
investment I so to be aware of sort of

1045
00:44:13,858 --> 00:44:16,259
that side

1046
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,480
um

1047
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,800
due to the changes in the market over

1048
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,480
the last you know like we've been

1049
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,800
talking about decade

1050
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:27,838
you can get really decent quality lights

1051
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,180
for not a lot of money

1052
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,519
um and there's no reason to pay sort of

1053
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:34,318
a tremendous premium five years ago

1054
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:36,239
there was a reason to pay a tremendous

1055
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:37,380
premium for LED lights because the

1056
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:39,779
difference between the top of the market

1057
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,460
and the bottom of the market was really

1058
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:44,220
significant and the only way you could

1059
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:46,559
get the high efficiency fixtures was to

1060
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:49,019
to show out sort of the the premium

1061
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:51,539
prices for those products a lot of those

1062
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:54,420
companies are continuing to try to

1063
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:56,159
demand a premium price but they're no

1064
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:59,599
longer offering sort of a compelling

1065
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:03,500
advantage over lower cost competitors so

1066
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:05,640
you know just to be aware of that I I I

1067
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,260
see a lot of Growers I'm thinking man

1068
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:10,019
you didn't have to spend that much I

1069
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:14,400
mean this is really even more true in

1070
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:16,259
the commercial side of of growing now

1071
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,940
um than in the the home growth side

1072
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,040
although I think it's it's sort of true

1073
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:22,380
on both sides that

1074
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:24,300
there's a certain sense of luxury

1075
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,500
pricing where people think that if I'm

1076
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,720
spending more for something I'm getting

1077
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,900
a better quality product

1078
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:33,118
in the end I think uh

1079
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,400
you know you want to pay attention to

1080
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,599
these and sort of Statistics that we've

1081
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,539
been talking about making sure you're

1082
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:40,260
getting a quality fixture

1083
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:42,239
um

1084
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,800
with whatever fixture you're getting

1085
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:46,019
making sure like things you know they're

1086
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,640
not overpowering the diodes they're not

1087
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:50,818
sort of goosing the numbers in that way

1088
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:52,318
look at diode count I think is really

1089
00:45:50,818 --> 00:45:55,619
something that I'd encourage you to look

1090
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:57,358
at even over a brand of fixture brand of

1091
00:45:55,619 --> 00:46:00,240
light

1092
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:03,239
um at the at the lower end because you

1093
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:06,000
did ask about Brands

1094
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:08,578
um you know I've reviewed several of the

1095
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,460
the medicro fixtures that are down in

1096
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:13,740
the the 30 cents per micro Mall

1097
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:16,740
territory

1098
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:18,838
um and I'm working with a a couple

1099
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:21,118
different commercial Growers now that

1100
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:22,619
I've used those have

1101
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,180
um set up the Medicare lights in their

1102
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:26,700
facilities and have been happy with them

1103
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:28,858
so I'm continuing to sort of keep my eye

1104
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:31,019
on that that's one I've been I first

1105
00:46:28,858 --> 00:46:32,818
reviewed I think about three years ago

1106
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:34,500
now and at that time I was like this

1107
00:46:32,818 --> 00:46:37,440
price is too good to be true like what

1108
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:40,920
what's the cash on this

1109
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,838
um you know the more mainstream discount

1110
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:46,500
Brands

1111
00:46:42,838 --> 00:46:47,759
um Mars hydros your spider farmers of

1112
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,880
the world

1113
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,740
um those sort of they do a lot of direct

1114
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,539
marketing they do a lot of marketing

1115
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:58,139
through Amazon

1116
00:46:54,539 --> 00:47:00,659
um they have a pretty big chunk of the

1117
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:02,460
home grow market in terms of market and

1118
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:04,618
cop

1119
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:06,119
um a lot of their fixtures are pretty

1120
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:07,680
decent they're a little bit more

1121
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:10,800
expensive a little bit more expensive

1122
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:13,858
than the medicro fixtures but you know

1123
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,539
the pretty decent fixtures I I from both

1124
00:47:13,858 --> 00:47:19,139
of those companies spider farmer and

1125
00:47:15,539 --> 00:47:22,739
Marsh Hydro I prefer their sort of more

1126
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:24,539
discounted line over there more premium

1127
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:28,019
line

1128
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:30,779
um in both cases they have a premium

1129
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:33,420
line that uses the Samsung LM 301b

1130
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:34,680
diodes which have gotten and we should

1131
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,440
probably talk a little bit about that

1132
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:39,480
because it's like the one brand name of

1133
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,420
diode that Growers really now them in

1134
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:44,699
the austram 660 animators

1135
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:47,280
um that Growers often look for

1136
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:49,019
specifically but I think that sometimes

1137
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,079
gets you into trouble and this is a good

1138
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:54,719
sort of case point of it spider farmer

1139
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:59,220
and Mars Hydro both have their top end

1140
00:47:54,719 --> 00:48:04,759
product lines that use the the Samsung

1141
00:47:59,219 --> 00:48:07,919
LN 301h and austram 660 nanometer years

1142
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:10,619
they have reasonable diode quantities

1143
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,800
and sort of a higher price tag both

1144
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:16,500
those companies also have sort of a more

1145
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,119
discounted line that uses Bridge locks

1146
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,039
diodes

1147
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:22,019
um and they use like three times as many

1148
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:24,059
Bridge Lux diodes as they use of the

1149
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:26,099
ostram diodes

1150
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:28,980
um granted the bridge looks diodes are

1151
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:32,579
not as high or rated for as high of

1152
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:35,639
wattage but they're still powering them

1153
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:38,220
at a lower percentage of the rated

1154
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:41,039
capacity than they are of the Samsungs

1155
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:44,279
and that makes the bridge lugs diodes

1156
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:46,980
ever so slightly more efficient than the

1157
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:49,920
Samsung diodes in their top and sort of

1158
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:52,619
model lines so even though the diodes

1159
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:55,980
themselves aren't quite as good they're

1160
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:57,660
using so many more of them that that

1161
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,760
ends up being more efficient because

1162
00:48:57,659 --> 00:49:02,338
you're powering them less and when you

1163
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,619
when you power a diode at a lower

1164
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:07,078
current it's more efficient when you try

1165
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:09,780
to like step on the gas you just get you

1166
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:11,818
can get more light but that lower and

1167
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,380
lower efficiency so you step on the gas

1168
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:13,980
harder

1169
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,440
um

1170
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:18,838
so those are interesting sort of things

1171
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:23,338
to think about even amongst different

1172
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:25,920
brands moving up a sort of a little bit

1173
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:28,159
from there and I can justify some of

1174
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,720
these fixtures in terms of different

1175
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:33,960
features and and different sort of

1176
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:37,318
options and things that they have

1177
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:39,358
um worked with Photon Tech

1178
00:49:37,318 --> 00:49:40,800
um the photon Tech is Luma Tech in the

1179
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:43,380
rest of the world they have they have

1180
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:46,680
nice fixtures they're

1181
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:49,559
I think 50 percent more than the the

1182
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:52,679
Mars Hydro spider farmer fixtures of the

1183
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:56,159
world and they're like 60 70 percent

1184
00:49:52,679 --> 00:50:00,118
more than the the medicro fixtures

1185
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:02,039
um sometimes even more than that so you

1186
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:05,099
know at a certain point it becomes hard

1187
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:06,838
to to justify anything kind of above

1188
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:09,720
there there's certainly companies that

1189
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:11,338
are trying to Market higher quality

1190
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:14,279
lights or

1191
00:50:11,338 --> 00:50:17,338
other gimmicks and lights but you know

1192
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:19,980
the real differentiation is what we

1193
00:50:17,338 --> 00:50:21,960
talked about how many photons can you

1194
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:24,179
create and how well do you do at

1195
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:26,099
Distributing them across the the grow

1196
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:26,899
space

1197
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:29,280
um

1198
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:30,900
every other thing that grow like

1199
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,480
manufacturers are trying to do you know

1200
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:35,039
we were at MJ bizcon and you'd see all

1201
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,358
these grow light manufacturers that have

1202
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:38,880
like

1203
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:41,179
um angle they can adjust the angle on

1204
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,818
the LED bar so you can like tilt them

1205
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:47,578
back and forth like that

1206
00:50:44,818 --> 00:50:50,880
um the supplemental UV and and

1207
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:54,240
supplemental IR bars or including UV and

1208
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,460
IR diodes and it's just gimmicks it's

1209
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:58,019
it's literally just gimmicks to try to

1210
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:01,079
differentiate from other people in the

1211
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:02,699
market and and or some more likes or

1212
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:05,280
charge more money

1213
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:08,939
um a lot of talk about tunable spectrums

1214
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:13,140
and you know or proprietary spectrums or

1215
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:14,940
it's it's just mumbo jumbo it's not

1216
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:17,159
related to anything it's a marketing

1217
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:19,500
battle pay attention to how many photons

1218
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:21,239
are created how efficient it is how much

1219
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,900
it costs

1220
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:25,618
um

1221
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:27,300
you know how how hard the diodes are

1222
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:30,059
driven is probably the next most

1223
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:33,000
important factor to consider so how many

1224
00:51:30,059 --> 00:51:35,819
diodes there are in total and how much

1225
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,519
power is there you want to have you know

1226
00:51:35,818 --> 00:51:40,318
three to four diodes per watt is is a

1227
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:41,880
good sort of rule to just take to

1228
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:43,800
evaluating

1229
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,019
um like any standard grow light there

1230
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,700
may be reasons that I would agree that

1231
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:50,579
you you'd accept lower than that

1232
00:51:47,699 --> 00:51:52,618
depending on what the diodes were but in

1233
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:54,780
general you want three to four diodes

1234
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:56,460
per watt if you have less than that

1235
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:58,859
you're going to burn out your diodes

1236
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:01,440
faster regardless of what brand the

1237
00:51:58,858 --> 00:52:03,598
diodes are and you're not going to run

1238
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,480
as efficiently

1239
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:09,539
um sort of more diodes than that you may

1240
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,940
increase the longevity of your light

1241
00:52:09,539 --> 00:52:14,759
um but all LEDs are going to sort of

1242
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:17,099
lose efficiency through time so if you

1243
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:19,440
buy an LED and you're running it at a

1244
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:21,900
hundred percent out of the box

1245
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,300
you may need to supplement light after

1246
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:26,460
five years or replace it after five

1247
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:28,559
years a lot of the commercial Growers I

1248
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:31,139
work with we plan so that they're only

1249
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:33,720
running it at like 85 percent out of the

1250
00:52:31,139 --> 00:52:35,818
box and can ramp up power over the next

1251
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:38,159
few years to extend the life of their

1252
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:39,900
fixtures I know obviously I said enough

1253
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:42,539
about brands in there do you want to add

1254
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:44,338
anything any specific brands that you'd

1255
00:52:42,539 --> 00:52:46,139
like feedback on well yeah I was going

1256
00:52:44,338 --> 00:52:48,058
to ask you about like the what I kind of

1257
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:49,739
call The Big Three coming out of China

1258
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:52,619
you know you already kind of touched on

1259
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:53,939
Mars Hydro spider farmer and and Viper

1260
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:55,079
Specter is the other one I kind of want

1261
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:58,500
to name that that you know they're

1262
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:59,720
coming out with really other so it's

1263
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,280
really

1264
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:04,019
yeah there's a real relationship between

1265
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,359
Mars hydro and spider farmer Viper

1266
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:09,239
Spectra is a completely different

1267
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:11,098
um entity I think of them slightly

1268
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:13,318
different although I like the new Viper

1269
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:16,019
Specter bar lights

1270
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:18,179
um for homegirls in particular I think

1271
00:53:16,019 --> 00:53:19,380
that they are actually better than than

1272
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:20,879
the

1273
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:22,140
the

1274
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,760
um better at distribution because

1275
00:53:22,139 --> 00:53:26,519
they're a little bit bigger than the

1276
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,900
Mars and the spider farmer fixtures

1277
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:30,480
um I agree I should have brought them up

1278
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:33,420
I also think they they're a good source

1279
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,699
of even smaller lights you know which is

1280
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,680
another interesting point two by two

1281
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:39,719
grows earned down in that area I would

1282
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:41,940
use a little Quantum board

1283
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:44,459
um if you're in a three by three or four

1284
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:47,338
by four or a larger space I would go

1285
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:50,159
with an LED bar fixture

1286
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:53,699
um not a Quantum board style light or a

1287
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:56,338
cob or whatever the LED bars are are

1288
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:58,019
sort of considerably more efficient and

1289
00:53:56,338 --> 00:53:59,338
better at Distributing the light well

1290
00:53:58,019 --> 00:54:01,619
what I was going to ask you about what

1291
00:53:59,338 --> 00:54:03,358
those three brands in particular is some

1292
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:05,760
of them are coming in I mean you can buy

1293
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:07,318
like the ks 5000 for example from my

1294
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,900
perspective which I've ran for several

1295
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:12,719
grows and I love it as well it's like

1296
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:14,639
500 bucks you know to cover a 4x4 or 5x5

1297
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:16,919
grow space now there are some American

1298
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:20,460
brands out there such as like chill Tech

1299
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:22,800
and hlg for example who so for that same

1300
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:24,780
growth space they have prices that are a

1301
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,539
lot higher upwards of a thousand dollars

1302
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:29,819
to cover that size growth space is it

1303
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:32,460
worth it to be spending hundreds of

1304
00:54:29,818 --> 00:54:36,119
dollars more for these American brands

1305
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:37,559
I mean I I suppose to a certain extent

1306
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:39,539
that might depend on on what you're

1307
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:43,079
spending the money for

1308
00:54:39,539 --> 00:54:45,960
um it's important to to sort of

1309
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:47,160
recognize the components in a lot of the

1310
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,440
manufacturing are still being done

1311
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:51,480
overseas even for a lot of the American

1312
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:55,079
brands

1313
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:58,199
um they're distributed in the United

1314
00:54:55,079 --> 00:55:00,119
States but often manufactured overseas

1315
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:02,699
anyways

1316
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:04,800
um it's hard for me to justify spending

1317
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:06,838
twice as much it's hard for me to ever

1318
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,960
adjust if I spent even more than twice

1319
00:55:06,838 --> 00:55:10,880
as much which some of those sites cost

1320
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:16,199
um

1321
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:17,519
and you know chilled in particular is

1322
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:19,739
creating some of the most efficient

1323
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:22,318
fixtures on the market

1324
00:55:19,739 --> 00:55:24,239
um they're Ultra Series I believe is the

1325
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:26,940
most efficient series on the market

1326
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:28,818
right now but

1327
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:31,099
like

1328
00:55:28,818 --> 00:55:33,599
you know it would be

1329
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:35,220
Decades of running at that efficiency

1330
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:38,280
before you'd recover the initial

1331
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:40,500
investment in terms of how much more

1332
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:45,540
expensive those fixtures are

1333
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:47,760
so you know fluence is is another one

1334
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:49,380
that's in that

1335
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,740
um

1336
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:54,180
um oh who's the the big one that gets on

1337
00:55:52,739 --> 00:55:56,818
my nerves all the time with their their

1338
00:55:54,179 --> 00:56:00,058
marketing foes

1339
00:55:56,818 --> 00:56:06,480
um f-o-h-s-e is is another one that they

1340
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:08,700
sell these really high cost lights

1341
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,460
um they target it foes in particularly

1342
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:16,338
targeted sort of the commercial market

1343
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:19,440
and their marketing is basically like

1344
00:56:16,338 --> 00:56:22,500
we know something about like that nobody

1345
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,720
else knows and like only our light does

1346
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:27,659
it so if you want this super special

1347
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:30,058
magic exhaust then you need to get our

1348
00:56:27,659 --> 00:56:32,219
specific light there's a lot of lighting

1349
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:34,559
companies that have basically taken that

1350
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:37,500
marketing approach to try to convince

1351
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:41,339
Growers that there's some special

1352
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:43,980
quality to their light and that they're

1353
00:56:41,338 --> 00:56:45,659
the only light that offers it and so if

1354
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:48,240
you want to have the best results get

1355
00:56:45,659 --> 00:56:50,519
this and then they Goose numbers on sort

1356
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:52,318
of their grams per square foot or their

1357
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:56,759
returns or whatever it is that they're

1358
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:57,719
trying to sort of prove that point over

1359
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:02,040
um

1360
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:05,219
I I I I I don't see how you justify

1361
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:07,318
spending the the costs for for the that

1362
00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:10,199
technology some of the fixtures are very

1363
00:57:07,318 --> 00:57:12,659
nice but in the end these grow lights

1364
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:15,838
get mounted onto the ceiling of your

1365
00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:17,759
grow space and like you want them to

1366
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:19,139
come on when you want them to come on

1367
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,760
and you want them to go off when you

1368
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:22,858
want them to go off you don't need them

1369
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:25,020
to cook you breakfast and make your bed

1370
00:57:22,858 --> 00:57:28,318
and you know do anything else they're

1371
00:57:25,019 --> 00:57:30,239
just lights so that's kind of my my take

1372
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:32,159
on on the really expensive models and

1373
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:34,259
that's my pitch to the commercial scale

1374
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:37,318
like I said I'm working with a couple of

1375
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:39,720
big commercial Farms that just went in

1376
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:41,519
all in on medicro because what we're

1377
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:43,618
buying are micro moles of light and

1378
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:47,818
that's the cheapest micro malls per

1379
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:49,920
light basically that are out there

1380
00:57:47,818 --> 00:57:51,779
um and now there are legitimate other

1381
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,000
reasons I think for for choosing

1382
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:55,619
different brands but

1383
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,019
um you want to be able to have a good

1384
00:57:55,619 --> 00:58:00,300
customer service experience

1385
00:57:58,019 --> 00:58:02,159
uh and that can be a challenge depending

1386
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,720
on on who you're working with and if

1387
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:05,519
you're working with a dealer that they

1388
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:07,858
can actually get responses from these

1389
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:10,739
organizations uh from these different

1390
00:58:07,858 --> 00:58:13,139
companies and I think some of the

1391
00:58:10,739 --> 00:58:15,058
American companies may offer you know

1392
00:58:13,139 --> 00:58:18,058
somewhat better

1393
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:20,819
um points of contact yeah but you're

1394
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:23,160
you're being asked to pay twice and you

1395
00:58:20,818 --> 00:58:24,539
know I I was looking at actual quotes

1396
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:26,159
for one of these grows that I was

1397
00:58:24,539 --> 00:58:28,800
working with

1398
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:31,440
um of a hundred and sixty thousand

1399
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:35,039
dollars for the the medicro lights or

1400
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:39,420
six hundred and forty thousand dollars

1401
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:41,460
okay it wasn't it's like okay you can

1402
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:43,260
pay an extra half million dollars I mean

1403
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:45,838
what what do we get for our extra half

1404
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:49,140
million dollars it better be like damn

1405
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:51,838
good customer service that's crazy yeah

1406
00:58:49,139 --> 00:58:54,480
think about it but micromole per watt or

1407
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:57,119
a cost per micro Mall

1408
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,318
um you know some of those fixtures and

1409
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,059
some of those companies that are

1410
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:01,500
targeting the commercial space in

1411
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:03,298
particular

1412
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:06,719
um are still charging a dollar or more

1413
00:59:03,298 --> 00:59:09,539
per micro mall where you know

1414
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:12,899
companies that you're in more com more

1415
00:59:09,539 --> 00:59:14,519
competitive markets it's interesting

1416
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:16,920
um and I do Consulting in the commercial

1417
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:19,440
space and I work with the Growers I like

1418
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:22,019
this on these lights a lot of the the

1419
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:25,440
commercial scale Growers are spending

1420
00:59:22,019 --> 00:59:27,420
other people's money and if they have a

1421
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:30,358
good sales pitch to go back to their

1422
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:33,059
investors or their their you know money

1423
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:35,279
man with about well this says the latest

1424
00:59:33,059 --> 00:59:37,079
science lights whatever then they'll

1425
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,240
they'll get that I mean people don't

1426
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:40,559
know enough now home Growers don't know

1427
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:42,058
enough either and that's sort of

1428
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:45,000
hopefully what you and I are on this

1429
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:47,460
mission to improve the the knowledge

1430
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,260
base so that Growers can't be taken

1431
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:50,940
advantage of

1432
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:52,980
um by companies they're just put on a

1433
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:55,260
selling Mobility Goods well I appreciate

1434
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:56,579
you shedding some light on lighting and

1435
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:58,680
talking about some of the things that

1436
00:59:56,579 --> 01:00:00,480
people can look for within lighting so

1437
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:01,919
they aren't getting ripped off you know

1438
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,719
we could go deeper and deeper into

1439
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,880
Brands and there's so many other things

1440
01:00:03,719 --> 01:00:07,379
that we could talk to about lighting we

1441
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,240
can't fit into this episode episode but

1442
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:11,579
maybe come back in the future for

1443

1475
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:31,019
want to set up and think about how to to

1476
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:34,260
do a light layout or sort of how to

1477
01:01:31,019 --> 01:01:36,298
effectively approach that so love

1478
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:39,720
working with with Growers I love sort of

1479
01:01:36,298 --> 01:01:41,699
straightening out grows and helping

1480
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:43,259
um sort of bring people to that that

1481
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:45,058
next level

1482
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:47,460
um really enjoyed talking about lighting

1483
01:01:45,059 --> 01:01:49,798
I hope none of the brands feel

1484
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:52,139
particularly called out

1485
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:54,900
um you know I think that there's there's

1486
01:01:52,139 --> 01:01:57,358
a whole sort of set of brands that that

1487
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:59,760
they need to to figure out what

1488
01:01:57,358 --> 01:02:03,920
justifies the costs that that they're

1489
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:09,119
asking and if they're saying things that

1490
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:12,180
I think aren't valid that's my job is to

1491
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:14,940
say I'm not sure that that sort of valid

1492
01:02:12,179 --> 01:02:17,578
out there so I I'm not trying to make

1493
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:19,619
any enemies we with that but I I do

1494
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:20,460
think you need to ask yourself as a as a

1495
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:23,460
grower

1496
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:26,039
you know what are you paying for in this

1497
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:28,440
and you know whether or not it makes

1498
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:30,480
sense to to opt in at these different

1499
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:33,480
price points

1500
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,039
um so hopefully this has been fun and

1501
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:37,500
enlightening I've really enjoyed doing

1502

on there and also information about

1512
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:54,358
growing in Cocoa which we talked about

well if you're interested in more of

1516
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:03,420
that uh science of LED stuff that we got

1517
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:06,118
into a little bit my recent video on the

1518
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:08,338
the science of Horticultural LEDs

1519
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:11,640
um dive is pretty deep into like how

1520
01:03:08,338 --> 01:03:14,880
LEDs work and the efficiencies the

1521
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:17,639
different spectrum and you know all

1522
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,740
kinds of questions like that so

1523
01:03:17,639 --> 01:03:21,719
um if that part of this conversation was

1524
01:03:19,739 --> 01:03:23,699
