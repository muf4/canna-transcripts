1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,658
one of the hottest products on the

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,759
market today for home Growers is this

3
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:07,979
automatic dry and cure machine called

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,440
the canadrill cool cure the thought that

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,320
you can get pinpoint accuracy and 100

6
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:15,660
stable drying and curing while being

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,399
completely hands off is a complete Game

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,019
Changer in this video I'll show you how

9
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,179
I've dried and cured for the past 13

10
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,980
years and how drastically different it

11
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:24,778
is now with the cannot troll I also

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,460
provide a complete review of the cannot

13
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:28,079
roll including as many details as

14
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,118
relevant and we'll also talk about the

15
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,098
pros and cons of this machine full

16
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:33,960
disclaimer I'm not being paid for this

17
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,599
video I personally don't accept money

18
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,460
for review videos I have a mixed opinion

19
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,280
on that I've come across many videos

20
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,920
that were paid reviews and they talk 100

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,420
positive and hide the negative that's

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,399
just not me you'll definitely hear both

23
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,020
the good things and the bad things about

24
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,120
this machine I did reach out to Canada

25
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,320
and ask them for a discount code for my

26
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,759
audience they said they don't do

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,500
discount codes but they gave me a

28
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,878
special link that you can click on to

29
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,619
see the best price available right now

30
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,899
deadlink will also show you discounts on

31
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:02,339
multiple units and a military discount

32
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,198
I'll leave that link in the description

33
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,579
section below and also as a pinned

34
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:07,079
comment alright let's get into the

35
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,298
cannot roll

36
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,280
I've been using the canadrol cool cure

37
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,260
for nearly five months now I started

38
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,060
with storage and then did a dry and cure

39
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,180
cycle when I had plants ready for

40
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,780
Harvest the cool care dimensions are

41
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:23,820
28.25 inches by 17.75 inches by 20 and a

42
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,640
half inches and the weight is 60 pounds

43
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:28,978
the internal capacity is 2.49 cubic feet

44
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,560
and holds four to five pounds of dry

45
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:33,299
flour wet load should not exceed 2.2

46
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,340
pounds you can set both the temperature

47
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,680
and the dew point the dew point relates

48
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,659
to relative humidity more on that in a

49
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,460
few minutes and the unit pulls only 70

50
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,920
Watts from the wall so if you had this

51
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:46,319
unit on for 24 hours a day and your cost

52
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,759
per kilowatt hour is 12 cents like it is

53
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,398
in my state then you're spending about

54
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,799
six dollars and five cents per month on

55
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,840
electricity not bad in their user manual

56
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,640
can control recommends four days of

57
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,618
drying at 68 degrees Fahrenheit

58
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,019
temperature and a 54 degree Fahrenheit

59
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,239
dew point by using temperature and dew

60
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:05,759
point vapor pressure is controlled they

61
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,280
recommend a four day cure cycle at 68

62
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,379
degrees Fahrenheit temperature and a 52

63
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,239
degree Fahrenheit dew point and then for

64
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,579
storage they go back to 68 degrees

65
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,439
Fahrenheit temperature and a 54 degree

66
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,660
Fahrenheit dew point this is a little

67
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,520
bit different from the 6060 rule that I

68
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:22,139
know a lot of you like to dry and curate

69
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,420
you could absolutely change both the

70
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:26,878
temperature and get the humidity to 60

71
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:28,199
60 on the cannot roll if you'd like I

72
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,179
just figured it was relevant to mention

73
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,619
their personal recommendations you may

74
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,480
be wondering why they don't go with the

75
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,219
6060 method I actually found their

76
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:36,419
answer in this video that's on their

77
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,539
YouTube channel

78
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:42,539
so a common question we get 60 60 does

79
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:45,539
your box do 60 60. where does 60 60 come

80
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:48,359
from 6060 is a dry bulb temperature of

81
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:51,299
60 degrees and a relative humidity of 60

82
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,400
degrees why did that happen well up

83
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,980
until now at Legacy systems you would

84
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,620
use an air conditioner like this to dry

85
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:01,079
the room if you set your thermostat to

86
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,420
68 degrees the compressor wouldn't run

87
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,819
so you had to turn down the temperature

88
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:08,699
in order to cause the compressor to run

89
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:10,199
to dry the flower well when you take the

90
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:12,060
thermostat and start hitting the down

91
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,759
button guess what

92
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,060
it only goes down to 60 degrees that's

93
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:20,280
where 60 came from and 60 relative

94
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,039
humidity happens to be a good place to

95
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,259
dry but the 60 degrees came from the

96
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,818
limits of a mini split with our system

97
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:29,280
you're drawing at the optimum

98
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:31,738
temperature of 68 degrees and a 54

99
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,860
degree dew point turns out a far better

100
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,259
product than what you get at 60 60. so

101
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,580
let's stick with the physics and set the

102
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,259
right dew point and the right

103
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,840
temperature and you will get amazing

104
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:45,359
flour every time now I've been gardening

105
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,819
for 13 years now in all those years I

106
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,739
set up a specific area for drying each

107
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:51,958
Harvest I've dried in spare bedrooms

108
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,878
bathrooms but usually drawing a grow

109
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,860
tent that I'm not growing any plants in

110
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:58,079
I had to ensure proper air flow with

111
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,420
oscillating fans popular exchange with

112
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,700
either an inline fan or opening my grow

113
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:04,378
tent one to two times a day to exchange

114
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:06,238
the air I had to make sure that my

115
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,639
humidifier had water in it at all times

116
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,620
many of you use a dehumidifier instead

117
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,000
due to being in a different climate I

118
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,700
had to hang a temperature and humidity

119
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,918
monitor near the buds and I just squeeze

120
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,659
the buds or snap the stem and remove

121
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,060
them from the drying environment before

122
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,979
they became over dry once dry I had to

123
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,720
put them into jars for storing and then

124
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:26,699
burnt the jars at least one to two times

125
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,199
per day for at least the first few weeks

126
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,240
I don't have to do any of that anymore

127
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,520
with the cannot roll simply harvest the

128
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,319
plant put into the cannot roll and then

129
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,418
turn the unit on they mentioned to wet

130
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,459
the sponge that they provide and set it

131
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:40,439
on a shelf on the second day of drying

132
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:42,719
and Beyond and I had to empty the drip

133
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,699
pan in the back of the unit twice when

134
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,919
on a dry cycle but both of those things

135
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:49,800
are very easy let's get into the pros

136
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:53,039
and cons of this machine Pros hands off

137
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,079
drying curing and storage there's no

138
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,240
setting up a dry environment no inline

139
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:59,519
fans or oscillating fans no filling

140
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,860
humidifiers or emptying dehumidifiers

141
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,539
and no burping jars you can adjust the

142
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,240
temperature and dew point to what you

143
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,220
desire the unit is small and compact

144
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,139
doesn't take up a lot of space and the

145
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,860
unit can actually be locked they provide

146
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:16,079
two keys low noise has a maximum of 35

147
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,419
decibels and it comes with a one year

148
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,879
warranty covering parts and labor now

149
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,620
let's get into the cons things that

150
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,659
could be better first one there is only

151
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,519
one size option I know there are a lot

152
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,160
of people who are looking for bigger

153
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:31,500
units this is simply one size that they

154
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,660
have right now next the controller on

155
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,699
top of the unit takes up space there's

156
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,380
probably a small con to most of you I'd

157
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:40,020
like to see the digital control built

158
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:41,579
into the machine preferably on the door

159
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:44,399
another thing to mention that there is

160
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:45,478
some smell particularly when drying I

161
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,279
know there's a lot of people out there

162
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:49,740
that use the canadrol and a lot of

163
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,119
people say there's no smell whatsoever I

164
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,340
personally maybe it's just because I was

165
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,860
sniffing for it but particularly during

166
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:57,599
the dry period I did notice smell when

167
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,800
walking by the unit so I figured it was

168
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,379
worth mentioning now when you put the

169
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,660
buds into the cool cure and set it onto

170
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:06,120
the rack flat spots can occur on the

171
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,460
buds however if you flip over the buds

172
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,139
after the first 24 hours you can avoid

173
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:12,060
the flat spots so I actually didn't know

174
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:14,100
this at first and I did see the flat

175
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,780
spots after the fact is when I was told

176
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,340
hey flip it over after the first 24

177
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:19,319
hours and then some people actually

178
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:21,359
recommend another 24 hours after that

179
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,159
flip it over again and then you don't

180
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,500
see any flat spots I personally don't

181
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,840
care much about the flat spots I am just

182
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,879
growing and consuming for myself so bag

183
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,899
appeal really doesn't matter to me but I

184
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,180
know there are some people out there

185
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:34,739
that beg appeal is a big deal for them

186
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,538
so definitely just want to mention that

187
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,939
tip there to flip it after the first 24

188
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:41,399
hours and potentially again after the

189
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:43,079
next 24 hours another con of this

190
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,659
machine that I wanted to mention is that

191
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,459
there is no app control here in 2023

192
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,780
there's lots of grow equipment out there

193
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:51,538
where you can simply pick up your

194
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:53,698
smartphone go into an app and you can

195
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:55,560
see the different settings and adjust

196
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,240
the settings from your smartphone

197
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,160
unfortunately Canada troll doesn't have

198
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,500
that capability it'd be really nice to

199
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,660
not only set the dry cure and storage

200
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,180
Cycles on there but also be notified

201
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:08,160
when things such as the sponge dries up

202
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,900
and water needs to be added to it or if

203
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,639
the drip pan on the back needs to be

204
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:13,258
emptied right now the only way of me

205
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,240
knowing that that the sponge has dried

206
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,860
up is if I walk by the unit and look at

207
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,720
the actual digital display yesterday

208
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,460
actually I did walk by and see the dew

209
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,039
point had dropped that's when I noticed

210
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:24,120
that hey I need to wet the sponge if I

211
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,038
had not looked at the digital display

212
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,139
there and maybe a couple days later went

213
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:30,300
by everything within that unit could be

214
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,098
over dry so be really nice to get a

215
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,379
notification on my smartphone when I

216
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:36,000
need to add moisture to that sponge and

217
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:37,740
like I mentioned before the drip pen as

218
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,779
well on the back particularly during the

219
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,400
drying period I did need to empty it and

220
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:43,439
so if I wasn't monitoring that area at

221
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:44,758
all it could easily overflow but yeah

222
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,439
maybe in the future this is something

223
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,598
they could look to do and the last con

224
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,879
but not least con it's probably the

225
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:52,918
biggest gripe from people which is the

226
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,538
price of the unit I could totally see

227
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:56,219
the price of this unit being out of a

228
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:57,538
lot of people's budget seems like a lot

229
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,880
of people are really excited about this

230
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:01,500
technology and they want it however they

231
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,360
see the price and realize it's really

232
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,740
out of their reach if this unit was

233
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,319
priced lower I'm sure a lot of people

234
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,639
would be able to buy the unit but yeah

235
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,259
definitely worth mentioning as a con

236
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,240
because it's uh definitely the biggest

237
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:14,520
gripe that I've seen in the comments

238
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,900
from people so price that's the last con

239
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,579
I got to mention today I actually

240
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:18,899
released a video on the Canada troll a

241
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:21,120
few months back and there were at least

242
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:22,739
a few people who compared it to a wine

243
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,660
fridge they said a wine fridge would

244
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,160
actually work better unfortunately we

245
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,919
had at least one person follow that

246
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,900
advice and the result was very bad they

247
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:32,458
purchased a wine fridge attempted to dry

248
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:34,918
their plants in it after checking their

249
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:37,139
buds just three days later they realized

250
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:39,360
their buds were actually over dry and

251
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:40,679
they had a small hay smell with a wine

252
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,320
fridge you can set a specific

253
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:45,359
temperature great but you can't set the

254
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,100
dew point or relative humidity the

255
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,959
inside of wine fridge is actually too

256
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,759
low of humidity to dry plants in

257
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,699
successfully it'll result in the plants

258
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,980
drying too fast I put a hygrometer in my

259
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,040
wine fridge and it showed 22 percent

260
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,659
relative humidity so super low now if

261
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,639
you're just talking about storage only

262
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:04,799
thumbs up in my opinion that's actually

263
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,600
what I used before using the kind of

264
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,338
troll I use glass mason jars with the

265
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,800
humidity pack in them and I also use

266
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,240
Grove bags that were heat sealed both of

267
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,519
those worked great but I wouldn't

268
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,440
compare a wine fridge to a can of troll

269
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,720
and I caution people who are looking to

270
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,100
purchase a wine fridge for drying the

271
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,440
other thing people comparing the cannot

272
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,240
roll to is a humidor because you do have

273
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,399
control the temperature and you have

274
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,778
some control of the humidity keyword

275
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,519
some someone linked me to this Whitner

276
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:34,620
chc120s stainless steel humidor and I

277
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,299
look deeper into it that unit does have

278
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,500
an adjustable thermostat with a

279
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:40,379
temperature range of 50 degrees

280
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,580
Fahrenheit to 66 degrees Fahrenheit but

281
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,439
that unit doesn't have a way to adjust

282
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,440
the humidity it'll automatically go up

283
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,000
and down between 62 and 75 percent which

284
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,680
depending on the temperature is most

285
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,480
susceptible to mold that unit is

286
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,458
actually smaller than the cannot trolls

287
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,200
so it can't hold as much the humidors

288
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:58,079
that people link me to require either

289
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,180
humidity packs or beads and specify the

290
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,278
humidity adjusts between a specific

291
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:03,899
range so humidors don't have the

292
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:06,059
pinpoint accuracy to where you can

293
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:08,159
digitally set the dew point or relative

294
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:10,199
humidity like you can with a cannot roll

295
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,120
all in all though I do think the pros

296
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,278
outweigh the cons and I will absolutely

297
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,919
continue to use the cannot roll it has

298
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:18,778
made drying so much easier and I no

299
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,919
longer have to worry about over drying I

300
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:21,899
actually have branches in there right

301
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,819
now that I have been avoiding trimming

302
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,620
that I think I put in there two months

303
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,778
ago as I'm sure many of you know the

304
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,940
trimming process is very tedious and

305
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:31,379
time consuming I'll get to it eventually

306
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,180
though I want to patch this question off

307
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:35,159
to you though what do you think of the

308
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:36,719
cannot roll cool cure let me know down
