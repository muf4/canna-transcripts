below and the sale ends on april 24th

13
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,719
can you flush organic you could but why

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,799
flushing in organics is generally not

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,200
recommended because

16
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,439
you're flushing out nutrients now if you

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,600
are running into a problem you might

18
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:52,000
have to right so maybe your organic

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,840
inputs maybe you're trying to play soil

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,920
scientists and you're feeding in

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,280
individual amendments as you see fit and

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,640
then also there's an imbalance of

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,879
nutrients in the medium and you're

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,480
having problems that might warrant a

25
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,000
flush in my opinion but if you're

26
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,798
talking about flushing at the end of the

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,478
grow i wouldn't i don't see a need to

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,799
whatever happened to the ac infinity

29
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,280
clip-on fans still use them they're

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,960
working great i think they're due out

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,680
next month i believe i think i think

32
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,879
they change it to april slash may so

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,640
hopefully they release them soon because

34
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,519
that's a big it's a hot product right

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,799
now for sure tips for blue mats my

36
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,640
typically

37
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,118
the water medium really well and then

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,118
i'll wait a day until i install it once

39
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,719
i install the blue mats make sure you

40
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,478
you know you push them down as far as

41
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,679
they need to go that ceramic should be

42
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,759
completely

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,520
covered by soil make sure you fill up if

44
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,439
you have any like air bubbles

45
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,599
in it you can actually use a little

46
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,519
pipette and fill the rest of it with

47
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,199
water unscrew it real quick and fill the

48
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,078
rest with water because any air bubbles

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,879
in it could impact the way it drops

50
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:55,118
water down i use two and a seven gallon

51
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,118
pot one on kind of each side so

52
00:01:55,118 --> 00:02:00,159
depending on what size grow pot you're

53
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,599
in you may want to consider running two

54
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,079
if you're in a larger grill pot instead

55
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,798
of just running one they work good with

56
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,399
synthetic nutrients the line you could

57
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,800
have some thicker

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,280
synthetic nutrient lineups that would

59
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,120
clog it so just be careful on that one

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,239
if you're top dressing with organic

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,400
inputs

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,039
i typically like to top dress the

63
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,959
nutrients where the spot is to where the

64
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,519
water is dripping down on so it helps

65
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,319
ensure that those amendments are getting

66
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,480
wet and staying moist in order for the

67
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,238
microbes to be active on there breaking

68
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,518
them down look into a nutrient well

69
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,439
that's another technique that you can

70
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,000
use if you're top dressing and using

71
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,800
blue mats and then check out the podcast

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,598
episode i did with michael box

73
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,879
just search mr growit michael box it

74
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:45,679
should come up

75
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,280
it's

76
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,280
how to

77
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,120
perfectly irrigate your plants or some

78
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,199
title like that check out that one

79
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,959
because he works for blue mats and he

80
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,280
gave a lot of good advice when it comes

81
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,598
to how to use blue mats do you add

82
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,400
oxygen to your water air stones i don't

83
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:05,598
no i use rl water put them into one

84
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,879
gallon jugs from my kitchen sink

85
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,878
then i'll bring it up into my grove

86
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,439
space and i'll have a five gallon bucket

87
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,598
and then depending on what i need to mix

88
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,280
in i'll just put the gallon of water two

89
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,639
gallons three gallons whatever amount of

90
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,640
water i'm using into that five gallon

91
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,399
bucket then i'll mix up my nutrients and

92
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,359
then give to the plant so i don't do any

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,360
sort of

94
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,239
adding oxygen to the water at all what's

95
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,480
some good advice for some dense nugs add

96
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,039
more blue light dense nugs i think

97
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,000
number one i'd say is genetics

98
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,560
you know you're going to get some

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,199
genetics that no matter what you do

100
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,560
in your environment in your grow

101
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,238
they're just going to be airy so

102
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,920
genetics is probably you know number one

103
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,120
i'd say uh number two i mean

104
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,399
just speaking off top of my mind i don't

105
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,840
want to put them in any particular order

106
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,239
but make sure the plan has proper

107
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,519
nutrition if it's lacking in some areas

108
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,360
particularly those elements that are

109
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,599
going to contribute to blood production

110
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,680
then you might see some airy buds

111
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,919
humidity temperature humidity your

112
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,840
environment kind of being dialed in i've

113
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,318
grown some plants in the past was a very

114
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,158
dry environment i'm talking like 20

115
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:09,839
percent 30 percent rh and it just it did

116
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,438
not dense up and it might have been

117
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,200
because my temperature was a little bit

118
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:14,719
too high as well so making sure the

119
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,839
temperature is in the proper range not

120
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,358
too high

121
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,759
because the higher the temperature you

122
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,680
know if you have your your nutrition and

123
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,919
environment dialed in

124
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,720
in increases photosynthesis you could

125
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:26,319
have

126
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,160
you see it a lot in folks that are in

127
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,519
flowering it's just their flowers are

128
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,880
bursting out in all directions towards

129
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,359
the end of flowering and then it's kind

130
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,719
of becoming more of an area structure

131
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,840
lowering the temps towards the end of

132
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,320
flowering is another way to kind of kind

133
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,918
of conserve those dense blood structures

134
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,519
as well as conservative terpenes

135
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,039
hopefully that answered your question

136
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,240
what else we got here what are your

137
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,080
thoughts on pre-made soils fox farm is

138
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,319
one that i've been using a lot of you

139
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,399
have tuned into my channels know this

140
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,399
fox farm ocean four so is primarily what

141
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,799
i use it's available in my local nursery

142
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,319
so i try to buy local i never really get

143
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,560
soils shipped

144
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,639
that's a great mix i know there's some

145
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,079
folks that say that it's too hot for

146
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,360
seedlings it's going to burn your

147
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,599
seedlings

148
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,800
i've only had like maybe one or two

149
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,720
plants that haven't had good results in

150
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,160
fox farm motion for soil

151
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,240
sure you might get a little bit of tip

152
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,840
burn uh while you're in the veg stage

153
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,199
that's not detrimental to your grill in

154
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,519
my opinion i mean that's something that

155
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,680
you can easily rebound from so i think a

156
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:26,478
lot of people shake off fox farm because

157
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,918
of that but i've always been using it

158
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,319
and it's been fine

159
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,079
primik soul is in general

160
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,079
it really depends on which one you're

161
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:37,198
talking about there are some good ones

162
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,439
out there the ratio is going to be a big

163
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,600
impact of it right the npk it says it

164
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,199
usually says it on the bag now some of

165
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,080
these pre-mixed bags they're gonna tell

166
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,639
you

167
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,879
what it's for right so talk about all

168
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,478
plants here you've got plants that are

169
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,360
like citrus trees like you might have

170
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:52,879
some

171
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,479
soil blends that are particular

172
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,038
particularly for that you might have

173
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:59,199
some soil blends particularly for flour

174
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,719
some particularly for vegetables i think

175
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,720
primarily that's what a lot of growers

176
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,639
were they'll go after that pre-mixed

177
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,319
soil that's for for vegetables so that

178
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,680
might be where you want to start i'm not

179
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,680
sure therapy grow if you have a

180
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,519
particular brand in mind that you wanted

181
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,680
me to to speak about that's kind of the

182
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,439
high level my high level thoughts on on

183
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,439
pre-made soils you can definitely use

184
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,800
them absolutely and it saves you a lot

185
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,120
of work compared to if you were trying

186
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,960
to create your own soil do you soak your

187
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,959
seeds in water or just go straight to

188
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,680
the paper towel method so i personally

189
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,599
will uh i mean i've done it all i've

190
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,439
done paper towel method right away i've

191
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,039
done the soak the seeds and then go to

192
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,120
paper towel i've planted directly into

193
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,199
the medium you could do it either way

194
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,199
one of my favorites you know i've been

195
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,120
skipping the paper towel often for the

196
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,160
past several years i've just been

197
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,478
letting it float in water you know small

198
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,560
shot glass of water filled with about

199
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,159
three fourths of the way full

200
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,079
putting the seeds in there and then just

201
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,160
let them float for a couple days you'll

202
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,399
see that the seeds should crack open and

203
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,840
the root will appear at that point you

204
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,719
know you can go directly in the medium

205
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,879
so

206
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,160
or you could go into the paper towel

207
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,120
from there so whatever you really want

208
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,199
to do

209
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,120
but i've done it both ways does soil

210
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,840
buffer ph to where you don't have to be

211
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,439
concerned too much provided the water is

212
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,918
in a decent range

213
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,360
exactly water is in a decent range

214
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:16,560
you don't have to generally speaking not

215
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,879
to worry about

216
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,560
ph nearly as much there are going to be

217
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,639
so many things in the actual medium

218
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,478
that's going to adjust the ph obviously

219
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,680
the solution you put in the ph of that

220
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,959
is going to have an impact on it the

221
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,598
microbes are going to have an impact on

222
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,359
the ph the plant is going to excrete

223
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,360
acids which is going to have an impact

224
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,759
on the ph there are various things that

225
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,080
happen in the medium that controls the

226
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,439
ph so as long as you're putting in

227
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:43,758
the proper ph nutrient solution or water

228
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,000
then you should be okay depending on

229
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,360
again the variables are the amendments

230
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
that you're putting in a lot of people

231
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,680
talking about dolomite lime as a

232
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,240
something to buffer ph some that's

233
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,720
commonly used so yeah i mean if you have

234
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,720
a low ph dolomite line that's something

235
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,759
that you can use in order to to raise it

236
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,759
what's the longest you've grown an

237
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,919
autoflower i still go on growing pop

238
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,038
december 4th so december

239
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:09,240
january february march so you've been 90

240
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,519
days you're at like 100 and something

241
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,918
115-ish days that's about the longest

242
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,359
i've done it's about 110 i think as long

243
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,719
as i had to go the trichomes just

244
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,560
weren't ready i think it said it was

245
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,240
like a 75 day

246
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:26,399
i was like what no way end up going 110.

247
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,319
some of the phenos went 75 80 five

248
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:32,478
but i caught other females i had to go

249
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,479
100 110. do you clown yes i do sometimes

250
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,519
not anymore really i mean i have so many

251
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,479
seeds

252
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,320
from so many different breeders that i

253
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,399
don't uh i haven't been cloning i

254
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,839
haven't cloned in years actually just

255
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,000
because i don't need to i can just plant

256
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,480
the seeds and i don't do perpetual

257
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,879
either i just grow from seed once it

258
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,278
grows over i'll restart what is the

259
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,600
craziest way you trained i can talk

260
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,919
about a terrible way i mean i took i

261
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,240
tried the old in my opinion

262
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:02,079
you know the plant grew like crazy and

263
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,879
then i basically just bent this one the

264
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,360
main stock down and kind of around i

265
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:10,240
started training too late and so

266
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,639
and it was so like lopsided so as it

267
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,639
came around like you know eventually the

268
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,439
branches grew up and the buds just

269
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:20,080
caused it to be such a shifty plant

270
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,600
and uh it was just not ideal in my

271
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,120
opinion that's going to be like the

272
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,800
craziest way i guess i've done main

273
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,639
lining before

274
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,399
if you consider that crazy or not i

275
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,240
personally like to

276
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,720
do a little bit of a variation to

277
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,399
mainlining which is i usually wait until

278
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,000
the plant grows to its fourth or fifth

279
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,600
note then i'll top down to the third

280
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
node i'll leave

281
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,800
the second node branches that come out

282
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,919
i'll remove the first node branches so

283
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,479
as the

284
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,719
node as the branches from the second

285
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,600
and third node grow up

286
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,920
top those and then you've got yourself

287
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,360
eight main tops right so instead of four

288
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,120
you would do a top on each one it would

289
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,959
go to eight then you can let it grow a

290
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,399
little bit more and do again and go 16

291
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:04,799
main tops i've gone as high as just 30

292
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,958
32 main tops i thought that was a little

293
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,479
bit too much i don't think i'd ever as

294
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,799
an indoor grower

295
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,399
i don't think i would ever go do that

296
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,559
again indoors

297
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,480
16 was a good amount in my opinion eight

298
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,719
was also a good amount as well do you

299
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,639
check moisture content in the medium

300
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,320
i actually don't i've been using blue

301
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,039
mats so

302
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,200
that kind of dials in the moisture level

303
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,719
on the medium without actually

304
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,920
needing to know what that moisture level

305
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,600
is i do want to get one of those

306
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,120
moisture meters though i need to get one

307
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,800
of those actually thanks for the

308
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,120
reminder i'll get one what's your

309
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:39,679
favorite line of dry amendments i like

310
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,039
to build a soil craft blend but that's

311
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:44,958
been my go-to recently for the past year

312
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,120
year and a half and it's so easy to use

313
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,838
just one cup per plant you know you have

314
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,919
that initial amending of the medium and

315
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,040
that's one cup per plant before flipping

316
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,120
the flour

317
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,439
30 days into flour

318
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,039
depending on if you're an 8 week

319
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,640
cultivar

320
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,319
nine ten week or beyond you might want

321
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,639
to do another top dressing on top of it

322
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,519
but i've had good results with build a

323
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,278
salt craft blend any tips for dry and

324
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,120
cure dry

325
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:16,159
60 60 60 humidity 60 degrees fahrenheit

326
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,399
if you can if your temperature goes up

327
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,319
70 75 the higher goes up the more

328
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,799
terpenes of volatizing so you're losing

329
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,160
those terpenes a little tip for flour is

330
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,000
drop your temperatures towards the end

331
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,919
of flour to kind of conserve terpenes

332
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,240
same thing with curing your storage

333
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,479
temperature a lot of people ignore that

334
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,560
i live in an area here where it's

335
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,480
probably well it's 75 degrees right now

336
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,319
just in this room temperature and if i

337
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,920
had a jar like a jar right here i'm

338
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,480
potentially losing some terpenes just

339
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:45,519
from this regular temperature i i now

340
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,519
have a wine fridge that have set i think

341
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,000
the upper part is set to 54 the lower

342
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,759
part is set to 60 degrees fahrenheit and

343
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,399
now i storm there in order to try to

344
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:57,120
conserve terpenes do you use silica

345
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,639
throughout the grill i do yeah it's safe

346
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,879
to use throughout the grow there's so

347
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,799
many benefits for celica

348
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,559
now short answer yeah i use silica

349
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,240
throughout the grow does freak show have

350
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,078
a traditional skunky smell or something

351
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,919
different uh you know it's more of like

352
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:12,638
a at least the cultivar i have is more

353
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,599
like a lemony type smell it's funny i

354
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,440
was uh

355
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,278
moving the

356
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,120
freak show for one tent to another and i

357
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,720
had it like all over my arms it was

358
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,200
flopping all over the place the buds are

359
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,959
just they're so heavy that they're

360
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,879
flopping all over the place

361
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,039
and uh i had it all over my arms and i'm

362
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,720
just like smelling myself and it's it's

363
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,439
definitely more of a lemony at least for

364
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,920
the finos that i have when will chillout

365
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,639
og be sent out for testing

366
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,639
wow that is a good question

367
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,480
lots of people been asking that question

368
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,879
it's going to be a while currently right

369
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,879
now i'm working i just planted some f2s

370
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,799
i'm going to go towards an f3

371
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,958
um see what i get there

372
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,039
then potentially go down to an f4 and f5

373
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,319
so i've got it's a ways to go until i

374
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,759
stabilize it

375
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,519
really when you go down generation to

376
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,319
generation it's just it becomes more and

377
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,759
more stable right now with f2s it opens

378
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,519
up the gene pool

379
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,958
i don't know how much knowledge you have

380
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,320
in regards to this but it's going to

381
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,319
open up the gene pool you can see a lot

382
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,480
of characteristics from both the male

383
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,560
and the female and so

384
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,560
if i were to send out f2s all the ones

385
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,679
you plant you could see a ton of

386
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,039
differences

387
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,479
i personally would want to be more

388
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,639
stable unfortunate's going to be a

389
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,639
little while here next year at the

390
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,639
earliest

391
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,440
you
