89
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,780
impressed and I thought wait a minute

90
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:22,579

91

nothing

92
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,459

93
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,199

crops mulch layers p H and living soil

99
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,640
which is a Hot Topic and a handful of

100
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:43,199
other things which I won't spoil it for

101
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,298
the viewers although if you're on

102
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,500
YouTube you can always click in the

103
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,120
description section there's the time

104
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,580
stamps so you can skip through and see

105
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,259
the different topics as we go along but

106
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,280
first can you introduce yourself for

107
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:54,899
those that didn't catch the first

108
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,419
episode we did together yeah I'd be

109
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,799
happy to and first off I love the

110
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:00,179
rundown you just gave because those are

111
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,099
really good topics and I could see

112
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,799
myself using this for our customers in

113
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:08,699
the future so my name is Jeremy Silva

114
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,159
and I'm the founder of build a soil and

115
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,259
it started about 10 years ago so it's

116
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:15,479
pretty big year for us and 10 years in

117
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:16,680
and I you know I anticipated that it'd

118
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,060
be something that I would love to do for

119
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,160
the rest of my life I just wasn't sure

120
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,660
if I'd be given the opportunity and

121
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,060
while it's not always easy it's my

122
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,000
favorite thing to do and it started off

123
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,160
from the desire to build living soil

124
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,899
from scratch and living soil is the term

125
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,979
that was used a lot back then so it's

126
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:34,859
still around

127
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:36,180
and from that we started lab testing all

128
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,160
sorts of different things that brought

129
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,180
me to the current place where I think I

130
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,040
can share some pretty valuable

131
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,900
information with all of you awesome so

132
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,120

00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,220
up and faster than I anticipated Dean

00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:01,379
who does our editing he's a wizard

140
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,000

141
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:05,279
more than your Instagram here in this

142
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,779
amount of time and I said no I said 10

143
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,758
years of Instagram posting there's no

144
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:10,319
way you're gonna do that and

145
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,120
um he did exactly what he said he was

146
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,219
gonna do and it was a great relationship

147
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,399
where he's good at editing and I talk a

148
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,720
lot it was easy to get content so

149
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:20,459
um really happy to be on YouTube and

150
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,500
really appreciate all the support tons

151
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:23,579
of videos and good information on that

152
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,720
channel and I'll definitely have a link

153
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:26,279
to the channel down in the YouTube

154
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,800
description section below so people can

155
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:31,319
easily get to it all right let's start

156
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,300
with the first topic seed sprouted teas

157
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,279
so um can you break down what are the

158
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,259
benefits of doing seed Sparta teas and

159
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,478
how do you create them and how often

160
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,699
should they be done so this is a good

161
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:43,680
topic and I'd like to bridge it into two

162
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,780
parts and I'll mention up front the

163
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,699
first is about SST and its origin and

164
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:50,279
why we use it and I can keep it pretty

165
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:52,439
succinct but the second part is we've

166
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:55,559
moved away from seed sprouted teas they

167
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:58,680
still are very valuable but the goal was

168
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,959
to get the peak enzymatic content as you

169
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,000
learn about biology the breakdown of

170
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,459
organic matter is heavily enzyme

171
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,319
dependent and that's why you hear people

172
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:08,939
that eat raw they're like you need the

173
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,978
enzymes in the food when you cook it you

174
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:13,319
destroy it and the enzymes are really

175
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:17,819
important to gut health and soil Health

176
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:20,038
it's similar and so Clackamas coot Jim

177
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:21,418
um which by the way we're going to do he

178
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:23,639
just sent me like hundreds of his

179
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:26,339
pakalola one his famous genetic that he

180
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,780
did a back cross on and I'm I'm super

181
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:30,478
excited about it uh but not the popular

182
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:32,219
the one sorry uh we grew that one last

183
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,139
time that just happened that's why I'm

184
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,880
thinking about it but as far as Jim goes

185
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,220
Clackamas coot

186
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:42,300
um he was a bread Baker he owned a tree

187
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:44,400
nursery he was part of many different

188
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,500
um

189
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,599
forums where we provided information to

190
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,459
organic Growers and he was just looked

191
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,020
up as this Legend and people really

192
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:54,418
trusted his advice because he backed it

193
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:56,159
with facts and he started postulating

194
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:57,899
that hey these seeds they have the

195
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,500
energy of life in there they use enzymes

196
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:04,138
to sprout not nutrients and so he got

197
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,699
some seed and he sprouted it and there's

198
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,699
more to the story but long story short

199
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,080
he grounded blend them up in water and

200
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,600
he watered that to the plants and the

201
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:16,079
next day in the morning he opened

202
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,939
um The Grove and he was thinking wow why

203
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,800
are all these plants why do they have

204
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:22,439
such turgor why are they so happy right

205
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,300
now what's different and so over many

206
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:27,418
duplications you would get that same

207
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,098
experience every time and one of the

208
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:32,459
things that is interesting is when you

209
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:34,800
are are gardening it's like a pet and

210
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:36,779
you know when your your pet wags its

211
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,120
tail and is happy and the treat you gave

212
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:40,978
it was something of benefit and

213
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,079
ubiquitously across the board anybody

214
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:44,939
that uses a sprouted CT they see these

215
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:48,060
benefits and I'll tell you how to do it

216
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:50,098
it's pretty simple but the fundamental

217
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,439
philosophy behind it is that when you

218
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:54,418
sprout a seed it's this enzymatic

219
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:56,639
process that allows the creation of life

220
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:58,978
and it's dormant in there we'd like to

221
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,019
unlock those enzymes and then before the

222
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,159
plant uses them we steal it we give it

223
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:05,098
to our plant

224
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,680
and um it also crosses over where people

225
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:09,598
that eat vegetarian or not even that

226
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,400
just a healthy lifestyle a lot of times

227
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,259
we're looking at seeds as a higher

228
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,899
source of nutrition and oftentimes

229
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:18,720
they'll have sprouted seeds as the more

230
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:20,519
available nutrition form because that

231
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,379
pre-sprouting unlocks some of the

232
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,000
difficult to access nutrients and allows

233
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:25,439
the gut to digest it

234
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,500
probably also because of some of the

235
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,719
enzymes and enzymes are weird the most

236
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,399
research on enzymes is for beer brewing

237
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,918
because that's where enzymes are very

238
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,379
important for converting starch and

239
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:38,879
sugars and making alcohol and it's a

240
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:41,879
certain process to make the same

241
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:45,778
duplicatable result so you can get find

242
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:47,580
lots of research on amylase enzyme but

243
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:49,860
there's not as much information out

244
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,420
there on phosphatase and protease and

245
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,039
all these other ones that exist in every

246
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:54,778
one of those seeds and that's because

247
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,419
the beer brewers didn't require that but

248
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:58,980
in soil every single seed regardless of

249
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:00,599
what you get will have a variety of

250
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,820
enzymes that are of benefit

251
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,080
so you can use really any organic seed

252
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,440
to sprout

253
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,720
and to tap into this benefit

254
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,459
the first time that Coots shared it with

255
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,740
us on the Forum he said go find good

256
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:15,659
organic seed any organic seed and the

257
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,759
cheapest that you could access tonight

258
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:19,620
if you don't want to go online and buy

259
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,958
any seeds would be to go to the grocery

260
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,060
store and buy organic popcorn seed

261
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:26,159
because they have organic popcorn seed

262
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:28,018
and bulk available and then you can just

263
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,240
Sprout them in a sprouting Cup in a

264
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:33,480
glass jar you can Google how to sprout

265
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,399
seeds and that led to us selling the

266
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,139
easy Sprout it's my favorite sprouting

267
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,059
device and we would use those and fill

268
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:41,699
them full and then you blend that in

269
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:43,979
water and we've got a Blog article about

270
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,440
SST you can Google build a soil SST

271
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,420
recipe it breaks down like the

272
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,279
measurement of how many seeds and how

273
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:52,439
much water but we've found none of that

274
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:54,778
really matters you just need to sprout a

275
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,160
generous amount of seeds and say you

276
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:58,320
know a quarter cup of seeds can Sprout

277
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,360
into a whole bunch of seed and if you

278
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,060
take that by volume and water in a

279
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,740
blender you just want to get maybe a

280
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:06,899
quarter full of a blender the rest water

281
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,519
blend it dump that into your bucket of

282
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,620
water and feed it to your plants and

283
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,839
that's the simple explanation you can

284
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,419
certainly get weird about the recipe and

285
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,860
that's why I gave you the blog

286
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:18,479
and after that people went crazy with it

287
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,399
and they try a variety of seeds I've

288
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,899
used our cover crop that's got 12

289
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,899
different seeds in it so that's some

290
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:27,480
variety for making an SST

291
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:29,278
we like the corn a lot out of all the

292
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,980
seeds that we've tried when we get

293
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:34,320
heirloom corn the water smells sweet

294
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,240
it's really white it seems like it

295
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,040
imparts a lot more enzymes than a

296
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,680
typical sprouting I don't have science

297
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,719
to back that up I just know that the

298
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,159
first enzyme that they found I think it

299
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,360
was something in the ocean but the first

300
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,319
time they were able to duplicate it

301
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,300
naturally

302
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,519
instead of like from an animal was in

303
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:53,278
corn and it's called zeitin

304
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,440
and so that's part of the history there

305
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,299
um but fast forward

306
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,740
we started learning well these beer

307
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:00,419
brewers they're not sprouting their seed

308
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,740
every time now there are still malting

309
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:03,299
houses that do that they'll Sprout the

310
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,980
seed across the floor they have an

311
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:06,599
entire process and then they brew the

312
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,339
beer but typically what happens is

313
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,019
that's a professional job

314
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:11,880
and then those seeds as soon as they're

315
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:14,159
sprouted they dry them out

316
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,720
that actually preserves the enzymes and

317
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,219
they're active and available

318
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,839
and I used to think that's not possible

319
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,579
because these are alive but we're

320
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,160
basically releasing the enzyme and then

321
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:25,859
putting it in stasis

322
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,360
and that is just a malted seed so then

323
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,278
we went on the mission well what can we

324
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,100
buy malted seed hence of course they

325
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:34,259
want to sell it to you but they heat it

326
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,600
and they do that because if you roast

327
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:38,639
the malted seed to a darker color you

328
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,440
get more flavor and so beer brewers have

329
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,519
many varieties of roasting levels that

330
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,740
they're looking for

331
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,360
so we went with the lightest one the

332
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,060
least amount of heat and that worked

333
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,459
really well fast forward kute and I made

334
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:52,559
the gnarly barley and that is sprouted

335
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:55,919
barley sprouted lentils and sprouted

336
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:58,018
organic non-GMO corn and so when you're

337
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,639
taking these Ancient Grains like corn

338
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,679
and the lentils and you're adding The

339
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,958
Barley which is heavily available a lot

340
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,299
of enzyme research they've already been

341
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:08,458
sprouted and dried so now what I do is I

342
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:10,679
take that grind it up fresh in a blender

343
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:12,239
and just sprinkle it on the soil and it

344
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:14,699
takes out the step where I have to plan

345
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,680
a day ahead to sprout the seed if you'd

346
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,600
like to sprout the seed it's fine and

347
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:20,879
many of us still do that but what we

348
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,800
learned was sprouting seed at home if

349
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,299
you're trying to do this you want the

350
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,699
tail the little white part of the seed

351
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:29,219
that comes out originally to be as short

352
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:32,278
as possible about to just explode out of

353
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,440
the seed or barely have left if you get

354
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:35,879
a long tail like that much of the

355
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,740
enzymes have already started to be

356
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:39,480
utilized by that growth

357
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,519
and so if you are going to sprout some

358
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,399
seeds you want to arrest them as soon as

359
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,019
you see that sprouting and blend them up

360
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,220
and use them you could even dry them out

361
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,139
for yourself some people will put them

362
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,399
on low in the oven you know like just to

363
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,778
dehydrate them and they'll make their

364
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,299
own malted seed

365
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:56,939
from what we can tell there's pretty

366
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:58,859
good science at these sprouting labs and

367
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,839
so they are able to unlock a little bit

368
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,639
better more consistent percentage of

369
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,040
enzymes than sprouting your own seeds

370
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,240
but certainly they both I mean they both

371
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,919
produce the same reaction it's

372
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,379
unbelievable

373
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,699
so that's the whole story I wonder maybe

374
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:13,679
if you have any questions or anything I

375
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,000
left out that might be helpful no that's

376
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,979
pretty interesting I didn't know about

377
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,958
that that second part there I know

378
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,180
people were still sprouting their own

379
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,739
seeds but having that option the other

380
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:23,879
way to get the enzymes is pretty

381
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,879
interesting it was pretty interesting

382
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:29,100
that you uh even use this 12 seed blend

383
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,600
the cover crop blend cover crop makes a

384
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,639
lot of sense for use because it's

385
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,079
diverse and so when we first learned

386
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,399
about spreaded CTS we learned that

387
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,799
basically every seed would work and

388
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,299
nature does like diversity

389
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:42,059
um the other thought is well cover crop

390
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:44,099
is usually on Farm soil and sometimes

391
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:47,518
those seeds germinate and die and it's

392
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,440
it's a natural process it's a living

393
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,539
seed meal at that point even if your

394
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,160
cover crop doesn't grow and you let it

395
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,919
Sprout and then and then you just till

396
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,179
it in immediately it's it's a seed meal

397
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,338
that normally you pay money for like

398
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:01,500
soybean meal but these are better seeds

399
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,420
you've made them alive in the soil and

400
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,759
then killed them and they're fertilizer

401
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:07,500
so many benefits

402
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,360
um even if the enzymes aren't perfect

403
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,759
your sprouted seed tea is going to have

404
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,039
some nutrition so that makes sense so

405
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,419
getting into cover crops then there's so

406
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:17,699
many different things that can be used I

407
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:20,879
know in your 12 seed blend you have flax

408
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:23,579
Clover lentils veg whole bunch of good

409
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,500
things talk to us about cover crops you

410
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:26,879
know the benefits when they should be

411
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,440
used I know there's some debate on

412
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,419
whether you should grow cover crops

413
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,760
along with the plant or if it should

414
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:33,778
just be in between grows so talk to us

415
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:35,639
about that stuff

416
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:37,439
yeah this is really good

417
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,000
um and this is a deep one so I encourage

418
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,399
people to do their own research because

419
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,778
there's lots of great information and

420
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,639
some of these organic trials that are

421
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:46,259
done they have methods for 40 years

422
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,799
they've tested organic growing trials

423
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:52,980
no-till trials and many of the higher

424
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:54,419
producing regenerative Farms the mission

425
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,039
is spread where these cover crop

426
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:58,198
companies pop up because they're using

427
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:00,419
cover crop it's working so well they can

428
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:02,399
then sell seed to other farmers and they

429
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:03,838
start to receive the benefits and on

430
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,698
farming it's pretty clear if you have

431
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,519
bare soil that's not how nature intends

432
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:11,578
it and that's the conventional farming

433
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,860
style when it comes to organic farming

434
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:16,259
one of the benefits of a cover crop when

435
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,620
you first start doing research is

436
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:21,778
there's multiples but the basic senses

437
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,000
that cover crops are beneficial plants

438
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:26,100
that have the ability to improve the

439
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,320
soil quality they do that through a

440
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,899
number of different actions one is they

441
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,459
grow vigorously and they cover all of

442
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,720
the soil and they attract beneficial

443
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,638
insects

444
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,800
but on top of that the thing I think

445
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,399
they're most famous for is that Clover

446
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:42,899
legumes Clover is in the legume family

447
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,600
they actually take nitrogen out of the

448
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:48,120
air and they have the ability to fix

449
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,300
that nitrogen through its nodules on the

450
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,620
root and a organic process and put it

451
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:54,539
into the soil

452
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:58,259
and it does it through two methods one

453
00:15:54,539 --> 00:16:01,139
is the cover crop can go can grow in

454
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:02,819
soil that your normal crop may not be as

455
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:05,159
good at growing in because the soil may

456
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,778
be not improved yet cover crop will grow

457
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:09,360
in there and it'll add organic matter

458
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:11,278
and as you till that cover crop in it

459
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,500
becomes what they call Green manure you

460
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,439
are fertilizing the soil by putting

461
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,778
freshly green grown plant that's full of

462
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,699
carbon and it used the sun and it grew

463
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:22,620
some of the nutrients from the soil and

464
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:24,059
you kill it and now what happens is you

465
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,919
turn these minerals that were down deep

466
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:28,078
it's pulled up to the top and it's

467
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,599
turned in organically so now your next

468
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:33,120
crop can benefit from all that fertility

469
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,220
and also the soil structure full of

470
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,019
organic matter will hold water it'll

471
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,899
hold beneficial life it'll hold

472
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:42,959
microorganisms worms all of these things

473
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:44,759
happen by utilizing cover crop and in a

474
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,859
dry climate like Colorado cover crop

475
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,360
Fields when done right there'll be like

476
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,680
a micro climate it'll be moist

477
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,500
underneath the cover crop the morning

478
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:54,539
Dew's on there so it's just

479
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,519
when you think about how nature works it

480
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:57,719
makes a ton of sense now what isn't as

481
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,459
natural is

482
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,839
when people first started using cover

483
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,819
crop indoors

484
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,160
and I think a lot of it took off because

485
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,480
it's kind of romantic it's this

486
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,699
emotional feeling to see all these

487
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,919
plants like a jungle growing around your

488
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,839
main cash crop because it feels like

489
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,640
you're actually farming or gardening in

490
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:16,139
a real way instead of just bare soil

491
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,880
with a plant

492
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,380
and when you consider that it makes a

493
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,939
lot of sense but we were told for a long

494
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,860
time whether it's in your raised bed

495
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:25,319
vegetable garden or whether it's indoors

496
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,938
then adding all these plants would be a

497
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:28,318
problem for one they would say it's

498
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,240
going to steal all the nutrients from

499
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,940
your main plant or it's going to attract

500
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,798
pests or problems I found most of these

501
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,400
gardening worries are inexperienced

502
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:39,240
gardeners having many problems and

503
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,580
correlation does not always equal

504
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,200
causation a lot of times when you know a

505
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:45,298
whole system you're able to utilize the

506
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,980
benefits and indoors some of the best

507
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:48,839
crops I've ever grown or when I started

508
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,779
using cover crop and it's hard to forget

509
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:53,579
that and I think what I relate that to

510
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,740
besides the fixing nitrogen all these

511
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:57,119
things which

512
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,579
fixing nitrogen takes a while it may not

513
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,439
be as big of benefit indoors but when

514
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:03,000
the plant dies it returns nitrogen to

515
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,860
the soil that way even if it wasn't

516
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,960
fixed

517
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:08,579
um but it can happen it does happen

518
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,038
especially when you're growing no-till

519
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:12,480
and you have cover crop going forever

520
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:13,919
um but the benefit that I think I

521
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,419
experienced is some of our earlier soil

522
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,400
recipes they weren't as balanced because

523
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:18,720
we didn't do as much soil testing and we

524
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,700
would just throw in according to the

525
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,160
recipes we read about and a lot of them

526
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,919
were heavy on extra inputs because more

527
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,000
is better right and we learned that some

528
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,160
of those excesses were actually

529
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,140
problematic some of the Amendments like

530
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,940
kelp if you doubled or tripled just

531
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,980
because you wanted to they brought maybe

532
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,058
some sodium or if you added too much

533
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,819
certain ingredients maybe there's

534
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:40,740
chloride or bicarbonate and for the most

535
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:42,359
part all these recipes work but if they

536
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,880
get junked up and too many of the bad

537
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:46,979
ones it takes a while for the soil to

538
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,960
leech it out and deal with it and when

539
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,240
you put cover crop in all of a sudden

540
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,798
you don't have to be as perfect at

541
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,079
watering because if you over water the

542
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,400
cover crop drinks it if you underwater

543
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,899
you're going to know because you're

544
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,940
going to get wilted and both the cover

545
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,380
crop as well as the main crop so it's

546
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,880
more about the over watering it helps

547
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:07,380
fix that but it also sent seems to

548
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,419
digest some of the problems in the soil

549
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,580
and then release them through the cover

550
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:13,860
crop which is no longer like too salty

551
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:15,779
or too problematic so it would like

552
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:18,000
buffer a soil that wasn't perfect and

553
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:20,038
I'd get really Healthy Growth out of the

554
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,960
plants and for when you're living soil I

555
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:24,000
mean that's what you want you want a a

556
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,679
perfect Leaf not burnt tips you're

557
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,380
you're trying to put in put in the

558
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,000
natural method to get the results and so

559
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,980
um for what it's worth the cover

560
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,859
cropping made a huge difference an

561
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,599
argument that you touched on

562
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:37,439
should we grow them with the plant or

563
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:39,058
not

564
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,759
it's a big one and I think that it's

565
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:43,379
about technique and so if you are let's

566
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:44,700
say you're growing a big tomato plant

567
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,860
and you know they take lots of energy

568
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,720
and they they grow really big

569
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:50,699
well if you grow cover crop and you grow

570
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,259
it 12 inches tall and then you come

571
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,240
spread it and you put a little tomato

572
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:56,819
seed good luck

573
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,038
the cover crop will absolutely devour it

574
00:19:56,819 --> 00:20:01,500
take it over it won't even have a chance

575
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,058
but typically on a farm that's not how

576
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,220
it works they would till that cover crop

577
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:07,139
in they would cover it with plastic or

578
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,640
they would at least cover it for a week

579
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,400
or two that would all turn into fresh

580
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,380
soil then they'd go plant their crop

581
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,000
um but for us what we see most often is

582
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,220
what's called living mulch or more

583
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,019
companion planting it doesn't have to be

584
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,220
cover crop but cover crops seem to be

585
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:22,379
affordable they have a lot of the

586
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:25,019
benefits we're looking for you can also

587
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,960
grow herbs and you can grow some some

588
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:30,660
quick growing food crops as companion

589
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,919
plants but what I encourage you to do is

590
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,960
let's say that same tomato plant

591
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,038
scenario if you plant the tomato plant

592
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,620
first

593
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:39,660
or if you have a transplant and then you

594
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:41,879
put the cover crop in the cover crop

595
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:44,400
becomes secondary it becomes shaded by

596
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,200
the bigger leaves it never really gets

597
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,940
to take off and it's more now in a

598
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,440
support role where it's barely trying to

599
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,538
stay alive underneath everything you

600
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,400
have going on that to me is the living

601
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:55,558
mulch technique that's where you get the

602
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,538
benefit of the moisture management The

603
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:59,940
Beneficial the Predators get to live

604
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:01,859
underneath there and as you chop it and

605
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,900
drop it and you might add some other

606
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:06,359
fertilizers at some point organic ones

607
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,519
they combine and the build this whole

608
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,859
way is to use like a high carbon mulch

609
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:12,900
like a straw mulch and the Browns that

610
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:14,699
are the straw and the greens that are

611
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,860
the cover crop when they're chopped and

612
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,600
combined together that's the foundation

613
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:21,058
of how you make compost the Browns and

614
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,519
greens decompose into black Rich compost

615
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:25,918
and because we like worms in there and

616
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,779
all the beneficials it provides a home

617
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,538
where normally that bare soil would be

618
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:33,058
beat by the sun dry and of no beneficial

619
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:34,859
use to all these organisms so

620
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:37,558
like I said we could talk for days about

621
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:39,418
just this but and and that quick

622
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:41,460
conversation I wanted to try and really

623
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:43,320
give you as many directional signs to

624
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,700
start to research as possible

625
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:47,279
that makes sense yeah I've been using

626
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,558
the white Dutch Clover uh for several

627
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,298
years now and I did just the way that

628
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,558
you had mentioned which is you you grow

629
00:21:51,298 --> 00:21:55,200
the cover crop and actually adding in

630
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,700
that mulch along with it and that's been

631
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,440
beneficial for me now one of the things

632
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,019
I learned actually a couple of people in

633
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,340
my podcast tell me that thrips feed off

634
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,658
of clover

635
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:05,158
which I thought was kind of interesting

636
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:07,320
to hear it's nothing that I have ever

637
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:10,080
come across have you heard of that

638
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:12,240
happening before no this is more the

639
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,619
fear I think that comes out trips feed

640
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,000
on everything

641
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:17,038
um so if you go on a grow and you're

642
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,538
planting fresh seed you shouldn't have

643
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,158
thrip in the seed and it shouldn't be an

644
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:21,538
issue so if there's trip there it's a

645
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,159
blessing now it's on the Clover it's not

646
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:24,119
on your cash crop I mean what's the

647
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,740
problem

648
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:27,899
um it can also be an early identifier if

649
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,099
you see something but thripper is some

650
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,298
of the easiest to deal with it's not

651
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:31,980
really a concern for most people

652
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:34,139
commercially it can be more of a problem

653
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,640
because they can't use spinosad and some

654
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,020
other ingredients

655
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,659
um which does make it slightly harder

656
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:40,918
but um

657
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:42,659
I tend to avoid a lot of those things

658
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:43,679
and go for First World experience and a

659
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,720
lot of people use cover crop

660
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,100
successfully and there's some

661
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,900
interesting cover crops that you can try

662
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:51,418
and use most of those are for management

663
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,759
purposes so if a big commercial facility

664
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:55,880
started using our 12-seat cover crop and

665
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:58,740
they didn't tend to

666
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,900
the mashing it down or chopping and

667
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,940
dropping or if there was a pocket that

668
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,340
got really out of control the vet can

669
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,779
start to Vine and while I like that some

670
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:08,339
people may not so they might choose

671
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:10,918
something like the white Dutch that is

672
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:13,139
no management it stays small it never

673
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:15,000
gets overgrown and it grows fairly slow

674
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,500
so it's easy to deal with and it can

675
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,019
tolerate some really cold temperatures

676
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,779
which is great for outdoor use

677
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:23,879
um for like a cover crop but indoors I

678
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:26,038
like the diversity I love the blanket

679
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,559
that the white white Dutch makes

680
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:30,839
but I'd love having the peas and the

681
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:31,798
flowers from the vetch and the lentils

682
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:34,319
and all the different things happening

683
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:35,639
and when I researched permaculture they

684
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,558
often indicate that getting up to about

685
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,840
12 different species of seeds gives you

686
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:41,639
the diversity that's required to have as

687
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,199
much success and an open field from

688
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,679
season to season where different seeds

689
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,840
and different things can happen right

690
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:51,780
um indoor maybe not as maybe not as

691
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:54,058
important but I like that a lot other

692
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:55,980
things you know to consider let's say

693
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:57,839
you have cover crop going

694
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,159
um a lot of this that we learned I think

695
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:00,779
that if I can point a direction that

696
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:02,880
would be philosophical for a lot of your

697
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:04,500
viewers really changed my life helped me

698
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,480
start building soil a lot of people

699
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,279
reference this book as one of the

700
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,798
reasons why they decided to go no-till

701
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:13,918
it's the one straw Revolution by

702
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:16,500
masanobo Fukuoka and it's a story about

703
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,360
somebody who worked in the long story

704
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,038
short in the chemical field this whole

705
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:23,038
life chemistry and then decided to go

706
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:25,079
back to Nature on his property basically

707
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,640
did nothing to it and observed and would

708
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:28,859
see how nature works and then when

709
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,500
growing as crops instead of growing rice

710
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:33,779
the traditional way flooded in water and

711
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,700
transplanted by hand they would throw

712
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:37,440
the rice in the grain that was growing

713
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,380
previously and I think it was barley I'm

714
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,120
going to get some of the exact crops off

715
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,440
but they would spread it while the crop

716
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,699
was still growing and it would germinate

717
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,620
and then they go harvest the next crop

718
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,419
and that would grow up through it

719
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:50,639
and so you started to see some of the

720
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:52,919
benefits of these natural cycles and it

721
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,259
teaches a lot about the no-till way and

722
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:58,320
the philosophy behind it in that book

723
00:24:55,259 --> 00:25:00,298
and it's it's amazing but he would teach

724
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,038
people in there you put all the crops

725
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:04,139
that you you chop

726
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:05,220
down on the ground and then he would go

727
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,860
to the neighboring farms and they would

728
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,140
have them all the like the stocks lined

729
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:11,759
up perfect he's like no

730
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,679
it's a child like nature doesn't line it

731
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,179
up you're to block all of

732
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,860
otter and the light and the bugs and it

733
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:19,140
needs to just be thrown out there

734
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:21,418
and so with that philosophy he would say

735
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,580
return all of what you took to the soil

736
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:25,259
other than the Harvest

737
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:27,298
um and so a lot of indoor Growers they

738
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:28,980
do that they take all of the leaf from

739
00:25:27,298 --> 00:25:30,658
the plant all of the cover crop that

740
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,700
they chop and they throw it all in the

741
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:35,520
mulch layer on the soil and while that's

742
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,720
great if you don't tend to the

743
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:38,639
environmental rules and there's not

744
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,038
enough airflow you can create a lot of

745
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,380
humidity tons of Decay and you can start

746
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:46,500
to get some of these bulb mites and you

747
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:49,919
can get a lot of beneficials but then

748
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:52,079
start composting right there and if

749
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,759
you're not judicious with you know

750
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,500
keeping it somewhat knocked down and

751
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:57,900
airflow there they'll start to climb up

752
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,400
your main plants and that can be a

753
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,720
problem because beneficial or not you

754
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,700
don't want them on your plants so that's

755
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,700
one thing to learn is that whether it's

756
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,620
good or bad when it comes to Nature

757
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,759
there is some balance that's required so

758
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:09,959
if you're going to chop and drop just

759
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:11,460
know that you should have some decent

760
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,980
airflow underneath there so that you

761
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,380
don't build up this and you know just

762
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:19,079
massive amount of decaying matter so

763
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,720
let's get deeper into mulch layers I

764
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,099
know on your website you sell the barley

765
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,960
straw I actually purchased some of that

766
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:28,199
a while back I use it in all my grows

767
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,940
but some people use wood chips uh I know

768
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,700
you don't have those on your on your

769
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,679
site maybe talk about the the reason why

770
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,720
and then also can you get into the blue

771
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:38,820
oyster mushroom straw log the living

772
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,839
mulch that you have on your site yeah

773
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:41,099
I'll talk about all of them because

774
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,599
whether you buy it from building soil

775
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,639
whether you're some part of the world

776
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:46,379
where you can't access build a soil I

777
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,980
want you to be able to tap into this and

778
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,360
so the idea with straw is a few fold

779
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,819
we'll be carrying like an organic wheat

780
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,399
straw that we use in the

781
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:58,379
um blue oyster straw logs and we're

782
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,298
shifting away from The Barley mainly

783
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,380
because any mulch works so I don't want

784
00:27:00,298 --> 00:27:03,058
you to have to go look for something

785
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,159
specific I want to put that out there

786
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:06,658
but I'll tell you where the barley comes

787
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:08,940
from in case you're wondering why we

788
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,380
used to be so specific it used to be

789
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,419
that if you had a pond on your farm or

790
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,299
on your property and you wanted to

791
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:16,860
eliminate algae you would flow vote a

792
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:18,839
raft and the way you do it is take some

793
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:20,278
logs and you would tie a bale of barley

794
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,619
straw to it and you just float it out

795
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:24,659
there and the breakdown would cause an

796
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:26,759
enzyme release that would kill all of

797
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:28,380
the algae and make the pond healthy and

798
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:30,179
so we thought wow if we're going to

799
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,039
really risk chopping up stronger grow

800
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:34,259
maybe one that adds some benefit would

801
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:37,619
be of use but really it doesn't matter

802
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:39,778
any straw and here's the next thing

803
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:41,939
um be careful like if you just go down

804
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:43,619
the street or Craigslist and buy weed

805
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,240
free straw that's typically Roundup

806
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:47,939
spread that's why that's why it's no

807
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,980
weeds so we really just want something

808
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:52,980
that's like seeds are fine right you

809
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,179
just it's more cover crop especially in

810
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,759
a container Grill you can always just

811
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:58,380
pull the seeds if you mulch thick and

812
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:00,000
some seeds start to sprout you can just

813
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,340
take the whole layer of mulch and flip

814
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,960
it and now they're extinguished at least

815
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:06,538
you know on an outdoor farm you can just

816
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,900
use your pitch fork and flip them

817
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:11,579
um but the mulch so the straw mulch the

818
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,798
idea was is that we're covering the soil

819
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:15,839
keeping it moist underneath it blocking

820
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:18,240
the light allowing the worms to come up

821
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:21,778
to it and pull whatever top dressing

822
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:24,179
down and be happy and it works great

823
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:27,179
um the straw that we sell is more

824
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:29,519
affordable but it can be dry and so one

825
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:30,840
of my preferences for somebody that's

826
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:33,538
doing it

827
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:35,399
um by hand is to put it in a bucket and

828
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:36,839
pre-moist it a little bit then when you

829
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,759
place it it's really clean there's no

830
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:40,558
dust it's easy to do without making a

831
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:42,058
huge mess

832
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:43,500
um but oftentimes those are big chunks

833
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:45,000
and I would like chop it up so like

834
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,980
around around the edges of my container

835
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,558
to make it fit in there

836
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:52,079
um and then the blue oyster straw log

837
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:53,579
it's that's already all done and that's

838
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,859
part of the benefit

839
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:57,720
um I'll get in deeper because it'll take

840
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:59,459
a second to explain so people can follow

841
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,740
me but let me just go through the wood

842
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,140
mulch first and then we'll revisit so

843
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,640
wood mulch we used to carry there was a

844
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,960
local compost yard

845
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,820
I used to work with them when I first

846
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,278
started build a soil

847
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:12,720
um and he had a screening machine so he

848
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:14,519
would take his compost that took a year

849
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,038
or two to make and he would screen it

850
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,000
and all of the reject wood chips that

851
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:19,919
would kick out because they're slightly

852
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,419
too large for the screen they were full

853
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,820
of mycelium and they were beautiful and

854
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:25,500
so we would actually sell that as our

855
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:27,658
composted wooden bark mulch people loved

856
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,179
it but even when I used it I would

857
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:31,799
notice that that much Woody carbon it

858
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:35,159
didn't seem to break down into soil

859
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:37,319
nutrients as fast for a living soil

860
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:38,820
um but it attracted a lot of the

861
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:41,099
roly-polies

862
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:43,139
and those little guys although they seem

863
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:45,240
great and they are a benefit if you get

864
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,740
bark mulch and you get a proliferation

865
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,579
of them which they often come in the

866
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,440
bark

867
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:51,000
you can have a million of them and they

868
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,740
literally once they run out of stuff to

869
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,940
do or overpopulate they will start

870
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,500
climbing your plant they will start

871
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,778
stripping the stalks eating leaves

872
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,579
eating seedlings and this is what I talk

873
00:29:57,778 --> 00:30:00,898
about with nature there's two sides to

874
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:02,639
it and oftentimes when you hear

875
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:05,639
something from Fear like oh thrip around

876
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,799
Clover you only get the one side and

877
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,020
nature is never that way and so there's

878
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:10,980
a great benefit to the wood mulch but

879
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:12,720
I'm trying to tell you the other side

880
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,720
that these beneficial insects that are

881
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,640
of benefit if a population outpaces any

882
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,839
predator I mean it's almost like you

883
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,100
need like to put some little birds in

884
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:21,658
there and eat them all or something like

885
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:23,819
it gets bad

886
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:26,039
um it's not good now I'm happy to report

887
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:28,980
it's pretty rare that you get an

888
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:30,298
overtaking of the roly-polies but that's

889
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,899
part of the reason why I don't recommend

890
00:30:30,298 --> 00:30:35,220
wood a lot the other reason is people

891
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:37,079
ask a lot of questions and they used to

892
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,759
be like well is this wood allelopathic

893
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:40,199
and does it have chemicals that kill the

894
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:42,298
other tree that grows near it well that

895
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,140
ruined my soil you can't use cedar What

896
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,639
if I

897
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,500
basically from what I've learned

898
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,600
anything works is mulch but if you start

899
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,339
mixing it in the soil now you should be

900
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:53,038
asking questions about what type of bark

901
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:54,778
it is so um hopefully that helps or what

902
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,359
type of wood chip it is

903
00:30:54,778 --> 00:30:58,919
other thoughts

904
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,658
um wood chips are used for a different

905
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,278
purpose than we use them for so when you

906
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:03,960
look up regenerative farming a lot of

907
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:06,419
times you'll you'll have conversations

908
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,519
about wood chips and the best I believe

909
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:09,960
are the rainial wood chips which are

910
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:11,639
very young trees

911
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,819
and when they're cleared out you have

912
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,980
very fresh more easily absorbable carbon

913
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:19,079
that's not so lignin that's not so hard

914
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,640
to decompose and you put it through a

915
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:21,960
chipper and you don't take the whole

916
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,640
tree just some branches right so you're

917
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,019
not killing a tree

918
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,860
but they would spread that on the

919
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:27,778
property

920
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:30,298
on soil that they were planning on using

921
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:32,519
in a year or two and that would enrich

922
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:34,619
the life and the fungus and at organic

923
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:35,759
matter and really improve the soil but

924
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:37,558
during that first year you can't really

925
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,259
grow in it the wood is so high carbon

926
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:42,119
all the microorganisms eat first and you

927
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:43,339
take all the nitrogen out the plants

928
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:46,558
can't really grow

929
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:47,939
another place you hear this is the hugel

930
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:49,158
culture beds if you've not heard of it

931
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,380
Google

932
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:54,059
h-u-g-e-l hugel culture and it's a

933
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,679
method of taking a whole bearing old

934
00:31:54,058 --> 00:31:57,418
rotting wood and then building a mound

935
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,000
on top and growing that way but the

936
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:01,799
first year that wood does tend to rub

937
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,500
some nutrients

938
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:06,298
um so that's a thought but when stuff's

939
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,278
on top it doesn't really Rob nutrients

940
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:09,418
whether it's straw or mulch so don't

941
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:11,099
worry about that when you're looking

942
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:13,200
into mulching as long as it's on top

943
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:16,798
that's just a like a skin layer just

944
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,240
protects the organism of the soil

945
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:19,679
um now that was a lot but I really want

946
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,019
to talk about the blue oyster straw log

947
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,460
because it's a pretty simple connection

948
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:24,898
the straw that we would use it's great

949
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,399
but you'd have some wheat seeds growing

950
00:32:24,898 --> 00:32:27,298
in it sometimes it's fine you just pluck

951
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:29,158
them

952
00:32:27,298 --> 00:32:30,720
um also it's a little dry and so we had

953
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:33,000
a local mushroom farm that said hey I've

954
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,200
got straw maybe you could use it and

955
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,359
they wanted us to talk about making

956
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,380
compost from all their waste well I'm

957
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:38,519
not going to drive down there I don't

958
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,320
have the equip it wasn't it wasn't

959
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:42,839
conducive to me you know making the

960
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,480
compost for them or them doing it for us

961
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:47,879
but we decided to sell when they're done

962
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,500
growing blue oyster mushrooms they could

963
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,840
get another fruiting out of them but

964
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,880
economically once you've done one or two

965
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:55,379
cycles you don't get as much result on

966
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,480
the third fourth cycle so they would

967
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,760
just discard these bags that had straw

968
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,860
in it and the benefit there was the

969
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:04,200
straw had already been sterilized it

970
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:06,839
already been heated in water and made to

971
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,819
receive the mushroom mycelium and they

972
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:10,619
put these grain in there that have all

973
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:12,178
of the the blue oyster mushrooms they

974
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:14,939
were growing for Natural Grocers all

975
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:16,200
organic and it was inside there and they

976
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,700
had already grown the mushrooms and we

977
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,080
would just buy them used and so a

978
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,100
customer would cut it open put it on

979
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:21,658
their soil and sometimes another

980
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:23,519
mushroom would grow

981
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:25,260
and it was all moist and it was already

982
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,019
sterilized so you felt like you're not

983
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:29,700
introducing any pathogens but a couple

984
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:32,640
things would happen one they would turn

985
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,558
green from trichoderma it's of benefit

986
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,940
but it would scare some people

987
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:37,139
and then the second thing that really

988
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,360
put the icing on the cake is they went

989
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,080
out of business so I couldn't get them

990
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,298
anymore

991
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,158
um luckily man purse medicinals AKA

992
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:46,440
Kevin he works here

993
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,778
um he's a Mycologist and went to school

994
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,100
for science worked at it at like in a

995
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:52,019
white lab coat in a lab for a long time

996
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:55,019
I mean he has a whole background

997
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:56,880
and since his passion was mycology has a

998
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:58,440
flow Hood the whole deal he ran with it

999
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,600
and he immediately started making blue

1000
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,820
oyster straw logs but instead of growing

1001
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:04,379
mushrooms first we offer them to you

1002
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:06,480
just like the mushroom farm would grow

1003
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,919
and they are ready to fruit you can grow

1004
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,199
mushrooms and eat all of them and

1005
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,480
harvest pounds off of them and then

1006
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,980
convert that to mulch or if you don't

1007
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,659
want to grow the mushrooms the cost is

1008
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,878
so good you can just cut it put it as

1009
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:19,500
mulch and the main thing here is now

1010
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:21,179
it's wet now it's sterilized and now

1011
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,739
it's really clean mulch it's slightly

1012
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:24,898
chopped up smaller to make sure the

1013
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:26,878
mushrooms grow on it properly and so

1014
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:29,299
when you use it you you get this like

1015
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:31,918
mushroom Rich odor when you spread it

1016
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,139
and here's one of the caveat one of the

1017
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:36,000
benefits when we look at what it's made

1018
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:37,260
out of so most of the earth is cellulose

1019
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,579
that's one of the most abundant

1020
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,800
materials out there so you think

1021
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:44,159
cellulose is plant material you know

1022
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,740
organic cell structure but the next one

1023
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,720
that's most ubiquitous is chitin and

1024
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:51,000
chitin we know activates some plant

1025
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,219
defenses because chitin is what insects

1026
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,079
are made of well it turns out mushrooms

1027
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:57,118
are made of kind so when we get this

1028
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:58,679
blue oyster straw log that's inoculated

1029
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,420
with all this fungus and it's all white

1030
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,460
and fully grown and you spread it out

1031
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,079
you're inoculating your soil with kite

1032
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,400
and Rich material which will allow those

1033
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,440
building blocks to occur to build the

1034
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,800
fungus that you'd like as well as maybe

1035
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,179
activating some of that SAR or response

1036
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,220
from the plant

1037
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:16,078
um that we're after now I don't want to

1038
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:18,299
say it does it I just want to say if

1039
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,240
there's even a hype a lot thought if

1040
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:24,240
there's just even a hypothetical benefit

1041
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:26,000
it's worth research and so the chitin is

1042
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,719
it's an interesting one it's spelled

1043
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,980
c-h-i-t-i-n and we used to call it

1044
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:30,959
chitin because we never heard somebody

1045
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,820
say it out loud it's like you got to be

1046
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,639
cheating me you know and no it turns out

1047
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,838
chitin not chitin so that's pretty cool

1048
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:39,539
I'm gonna have to pick up one of those

1049
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:41,699
mushroom straw logs and try that out for

1050
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:42,779
myself that sounds pretty cool it is and

1051
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:45,118
it's one of those that's great because

1052
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,859
Kevin gets to add the value a lot of

1053
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,820
people use them for mushrooms get more

1054
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:49,440
than their money's worth out of

1055
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,539
mushrooms before they use it as mulch if

1056
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,220
they have the discipline but it's fairly

1057
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:55,019
hard to reproduce on your own you gotta

1058
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:57,179
like sterilize boil water get the Grain

1059
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:59,280
and so he really is adding a lot of

1060
00:35:57,179 --> 00:36:02,039
value by making it and I think that's a

1061
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,540
true win-win you know so absolutely I do

1062
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:05,279
have another mulch question well it kind

1063
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:07,500
of relates to mulch not necessarily is

1064
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,820
mulch but a lot of folks in order to

1065
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,440
retain water and stuff when you guys

1066
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,780
deal with the Earth boxes is just simply

1067
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,659
cover the top of the soil and use a

1068
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,040
piece of plastic so that um or some

1069
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:18,118
people using cardboard board as well

1070
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:19,500
they're cutting up pieces and then

1071
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:21,119
putting it there but it's not actually

1072
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,559
like breaking down like a mulch I guess

1073
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,700
that's why you know I want to know if

1074
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:25,500
you really want to consider it a true

1075
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:27,419
malt but it's not really breaking down

1076
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,800
what are your thoughts on like putting

1077
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,240
cardboard on top

1078
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,920
I think there's some benefit we did it

1079
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,019
in one of our last YouTube series not to

1080
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,000
live as the mulch but when I left town I

1081
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:38,099
actually covered the recently decomposed

1082
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,358
cover crop with the cardboard to keep

1083
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:41,280
the light off of it and let the

1084
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:42,960
organisms work it into soil when I

1085
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,339
pulled the cardboard off you could I

1086
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,019
mean the cover crop was gone it was all

1087
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:47,699
so oil there's a couple little patches

1088
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:50,219
but you'd work your hands in and it was

1089
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:53,639
no longer six inches of plant it was

1090
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:56,939
soil and so that cover is one of the

1091
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:59,400
benefits of mulch if you're using

1092
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,380
um you know a carbon Rich mulch or a

1093
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,420
green manure mulch where you're chopping

1094
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,519
the greens and mulching with it

1095
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,019
those all have multiple benefits but

1096
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:08,639
with multiple benefits comes some

1097
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:11,280
responsibility like I said it's adding

1098
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:13,500
nutrients it's decomposing and so a

1099
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,660
simple cover removes all of the thought

1100
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,760
of how long does it take to decompose

1101
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:19,980
and is this good for my soil and it

1102
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,420
simply covers it and cover is good

1103
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,338
because the soil doesn't need to be hit

1104
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,440
by the UV of the Sun and your your

1105
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:27,900
lights and then the worms can come right

1106
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,460
up to the soil surface and there's a

1107
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,139
whole population of beneficials you

1108
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,659
could peel the plastic back and see it

1109
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:35,879
and I originally didn't like the idea of

1110
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:38,879
the plastic because it's not as romantic

1111
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,380
as I say it's not as like doesn't tug on

1112
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,880
your heartstrings that Nature's not

1113
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,200
always that way a lot of us think nature

1114
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,660
and just to have all these views but

1115
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:47,759
it's like nature can be pretty hardcore

1116
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:49,319
you know it's a lot of like besides

1117
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,480
Poison Ivy and animals killing each

1118
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,220
other I mean it's not always all perfect

1119
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,280
but when we're looking at covering it

1120
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:58,559
versus the natural process at least you

1121
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,839
get that covered and when it comes to

1122
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,940
organic farming they use plastic a lot

1123
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:04,500
now they get a really thick piece they

1124
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:07,200
can reuse over and over it's not being

1125
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,880
wasteful but when it comes to commercial

1126
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:09,960
farming like if you picture a hundred

1127
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,240
foot row

1128
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,500
three feet wide full of lettuce or or

1129
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:14,939
they're about to seed it and they have

1130
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,099
to use machines to seed it so it's all

1131
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,838
evenly done you can't just cover crop

1132
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:21,300
and then run the seed machine so what

1133
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:23,519
they would do is they would cover crop

1134
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,320
and as soon as it got a few inches tall

1135
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:27,239
they would use a machine to kind of just

1136
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,800
lightly till it under or whip it under

1137
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:30,838
the first layer so now it's buried by

1138
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,640
the soil and then come pull that heavy

1139
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:34,619
black plastic over and put rocks on it

1140
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:37,440
wait a couple of weeks pull it all back

1141
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:39,358
off and have unbelievable carbon rich

1142
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,639
black beautiful soil that has been

1143
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:44,639
freshly inoculated with all that that

1144
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:48,000
mulch and then they plant into it so

1145
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:50,338
using a cover is understanding how to

1146
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,800
use a tool and and the earth box the

1147
00:38:50,338 --> 00:38:54,000
reason why we recommend that cover is we

1148
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,500
have a lot of our customers that use

1149
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,760
straw and cover crop in the earth box

1150
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,920
and it works great

1151
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,839
but the earth box is only about a cubic

1152
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,960
foot of soil maybe a cubic foot and a

1153
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:05,880
half plus the the water holding area

1154
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,579
when you grow a big plant out of that it

1155
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,200
can start to run out of nutrients and if

1156
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:12,000
you have a regular mulch layer you can

1157
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:14,399
only water through it but with the

1158
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,679
plastic you can Mound and picture this

1159
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,660
is the container the earth box wall and

1160
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:21,659
your plant is in it you can mount three

1161
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:24,239
four five six inches above the top with

1162
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:25,618
compost and organic amendments

1163
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,000
and the reason why this works is you

1164
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:28,680
don't have to water on the top where the

1165
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,139
water spills out the side you water down

1166
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:33,419
below in the earth box and when you

1167
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:36,059
cover that big mulch layer that's packed

1168
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,740
as a mound with the plastic the feeder

1169
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:40,679
Roots can go all the way up in it and

1170
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:42,838
digest it and in the earth box normally

1171
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:45,179
that much mulch material might be a

1172
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:47,159
little rich but the earth box has clean

1173
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:49,980
water so the roots can always access

1174
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:52,139
water without nutrients to balance and

1175
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,880
it seems to work really well so I like

1176
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,739
the cover I just don't like it's as

1177
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:59,099
appearance as much and I really do like

1178
00:39:55,739 --> 00:40:01,078
fresh straw with the green cover crop it

1179
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:03,838
really is something like art I just it's

1180
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:06,599
beautiful so yeah I've been using the

1181
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,880
cardboard to cover on some of my recent

1182
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,859
grows just I did have somebody comment

1183
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,838
on one of my videos mentioning that

1184
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:15,299
there's some concern that chemicals are

1185
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:17,578
kind of that are on the actual cardboard

1186
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:19,980
could get released into the soil and

1187
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:21,539
those chemicals don't break down very

1188
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,280
well and same thing with like the

1189
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:26,279
plastic have you heard anything about

1190
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,019
that is that say concern or what I would

1191
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,400
say it's not a concern but I wanna I

1192
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:31,440
wanna get there because their thoughts

1193
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,000
are totally in the right place and you

1194
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,380
should be concerned because most of the

1195
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,420
industrial stuff is going to have some

1196
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,059
problems with it but I would encourage

1197
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,559
you to think of it as

1198
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:41,940
a lot of these compounds the plant's not

1199
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:43,619
going to take up like some people are

1200
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,139
worried about some of the chemicals in

1201
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:47,940
plastic I'm like I mean farmers use PVC

1202
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:50,098
all day long to irrigate and none of

1203
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,539
that actual material grows into the

1204
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:54,180
plant but we don't want to hurt the soil

1205
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:55,800
either and we want to be mindful but I

1206
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:57,598
think if you go narrow focused on

1207
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,099
something you can kind of get a little

1208
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,160
too deep without missing the rest of the

1209
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:04,680
opportunity composting by Nature

1210
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:07,440
cleans it removes pathogens and

1211
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:08,699
chemicals and it improves so that if I

1212
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,838
was really going to be forced to use

1213
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,519
something that was contaminated

1214
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:13,019
composting it and then working it

1215
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,000
through worms would give me the most

1216
00:41:13,019 --> 00:41:16,980
relief that at least we tried to

1217
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,420
remediate and so when you're talking

1218
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,820
cardboard that's mostly carbon

1219
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:23,159
oftentimes it's either newspaper to a

1220
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,019
worm bin or cardboard to a worm bin now

1221
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:26,519
as a cover it's different but in a worm

1222
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:28,079
bed people shred cardboard shred

1223
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:30,000
newspaper they feed it to their worms

1224
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,700
the worms don't die the worms go crazy

1225
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,619
they eat it all but the thought is the

1226
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:36,419
ink on the newspaper is a problem and

1227
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:38,880
they're like it's chemicals well it's

1228
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:41,099
soy based ink and it's not really a

1229
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,619
problem the challenge I have is I don't

1230
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:46,200
try and put Roundup sprayed soy that's

1231
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:48,300
industrial and and my grow so I would

1232
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:49,980
try to avoid it but the smarter side of

1233
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,839
me knows that it's small amounts and the

1234
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,699
microorganisms and the worms just rip

1235
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:55,619
that to shreds as far as the actual

1236
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:57,659
chemicals and what I mean is

1237
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:59,940
if a chemical is in there composting

1238
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:02,039
biology worms and their enzymes they can

1239
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,599
actually take a chemical structure and

1240
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:05,039
break it apart so that it's no longer

1241
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,660
that dangerous chemical it's just the

1242
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:08,519
carbon hydrogen it's just the individual

1243
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:10,559
components that made something like that

1244
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:12,780
it's structure

1245
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:15,599
um and I won't say that you know you can

1246
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:17,099
take something like a radioactive waste

1247
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,380
and it'll be clean just because you have

1248
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:21,000
some worms in there but my suspicion is

1249
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,500
a small amount of cardboard when you see

1250
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,599
the worms going in the grooves and

1251
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,559
mating and the enzymes that are being

1252
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:28,079
produced

1253
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:30,539
I I find it very very very unlikely that

1254
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,760
you'd have any sort of health problem

1255
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:35,159
from doing that whether it's soil or

1256
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,720
your own health and so I'm not a doctor

1257
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:38,399
but I really think that you'd be fine

1258
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:40,199
with some cardboard on top of your soil

1259
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,059
but I also understand what they're

1260
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:44,039
saying right some of these maybe the

1261
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,900
glues got something in it that's a

1262
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:47,759
little bit weird

1263
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:50,280
um and so those are my thoughts on it

1264
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,079
understood all right let's move on to a

1265
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,060
viewer question so this one was actually

1266
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,920
left in the comments section on the last

1267
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:58,980
episode we did together and it relates

1268
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:02,460
to pH in living soil so this viewer says

1269
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:06,240
their tap Waters comes in at 8.9 pH and

1270
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:08,280
after filtering it's still 8.5 pH should

1271
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:10,318
they lower the pH of the water prior to

1272
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,780
doing a soil drench if so what should

1273
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:14,579
they use to lower the pH

1274
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,180
it's a good question

1275
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:18,318
um

1276
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:22,019
pH and living soil has always been a big

1277
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:23,940
like argument point and I'll give you a

1278
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:26,159
little Spiel on soil pH

1279
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,559
before we get into what this person

1280
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:31,379
should do about their water

1281
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:33,119
um because there's no one simple answer

1282
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,519
I kind of relate it to jiu jitsu because

1283
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,500
I grapple regularly and when you get an

1284
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:38,699
answer from a white or blue belt it

1285
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,079
might be an answer that would work but

1286
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,279
you don't know if it works up to the

1287
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,560
highest level

1288
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,180
and you start to find when you ask a

1289
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:46,440
black belt hey how do I get out of this

1290
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:48,000
problem and then he just looks at you

1291
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,460
and says don't don't get in that problem

1292
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,500
you know and so it's kind of frustrating

1293
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:54,119
but typically the smarter people I know

1294
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,858
they don't have just a straight answer

1295
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:57,720
it's kind of like it depends

1296
00:43:55,858 --> 00:44:00,420
so when we're talking about pH it really

1297
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:01,799
does depend when you're on a farm and

1298
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,200
you're growing out here in Colorado our

1299
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,000
soil is pretty alkaline but if it's not

1300
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:07,618
full of alkalinity and problematic

1301
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,780
substances it's just full of calcium

1302
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:11,099
it's amazing soil you don't really want

1303
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,079
to lower the pH

1304
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:15,900
and what I mean by that is the soil is

1305
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:17,220
made up of these elements that dictate

1306
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,380
the pH

1307
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:21,358
same in our potting soils so when we

1308
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:25,019
make a potting soil and we're adding

1309
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:28,078
copious amounts of rock dust Clays and

1310
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:30,659
composts we're attempting to mimic a

1311
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,460
regular High organic matter soil and so

1312
00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:33,779
that's why we call it living soil not

1313
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,880
potting soil potting soil is basically

1314
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,960
hydroponic it's just a medium to hold

1315
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,180
water

1316
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,679
but when we get to the point where we're

1317
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:42,719
designing it and we send it to the lab

1318
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,399
you can see this percentage calcium

1319
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:46,199
magnesium potassium all the different

1320
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,599
things that are in it that's actually

1321
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:51,000
what creates your soil pH

1322
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:52,980
and so if you take some water and you

1323
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,239
put a half gallon in there and it

1324
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,679
doesn't just pour out the bottom like

1325
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:58,139
you're not leaching the soil you're just

1326
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:00,899
watering it the water isn't going to

1327
00:44:58,139 --> 00:45:02,338
change the pH of the soil unless you

1328
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,740
strip out the calcium or add more

1329
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:07,380
magnesium or dump sodium in it that's

1330
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:09,059
what dictates the pH of the soil

1331
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,260
and a lot of Growers they start reading

1332
00:45:09,059 --> 00:45:12,119
they're like wow plants can't take up

1333
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,200
nutrients if the pH is off that must be

1334
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:14,579
what's going on

1335
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:16,500
well they also can't if you're over

1336
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:18,359
watered so sometimes it's something else

1337
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,280
that's that's causing the issue not

1338
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:23,159
really the water but

1339
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:25,980
um when you let's say you took perfectly

1340
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:28,078
clean water and it was 7.0 pH it was

1341
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,920
just Ro there's zero parts per million

1342
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,560
in there

1343
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,240
and someone tells you 5.5 pH is better

1344
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:34,619
so you pH Down

1345
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:36,118
I mean literally you're putting a little

1346
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:37,619
bit of you're just adjusting the

1347
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:38,700
hydrogen ever so slightly there's no

1348
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:40,260
sodium in there there's no calcium

1349
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:42,000
there's nothing that's really going to

1350
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,920
change anything the soil will probably

1351
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,019
change the water but what's interesting

1352
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,059
is the soil pH is what dictates the

1353
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:50,519
uptake of nutrients and the root in a

1354
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:53,039
living soil grow can change the ph and

1355
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:55,739
that two to three millimeter Zone uh

1356
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:57,900
right around the root tip significantly

1357
00:45:55,739 --> 00:46:00,000
on on an exponential scale moving a

1358
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,920
pointer to is like logarithmic it's like

1359
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,440
much greater than it sounds and the

1360
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,700
plant can do that so who are we fooling

1361
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,619
if we're trying to predict the perfect

1362
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:09,419
pH where the plant might be saying no

1363
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:10,858
I'm trying to force the soil to be in

1364
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:13,619
this range and you keep coming in and

1365
00:46:10,858 --> 00:46:15,358
changing it so being a steward means

1366
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:17,460
trusting the soil but you can't trust

1367
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:19,980
some soil that's full of salt I'm saying

1368
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:22,079
a well-built soil the pH should totally

1369
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:24,659
handle itself and you you just should

1370
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,880
not have any concern of pH at all

1371
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:28,799
but here's the curveball

1372
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,300
when you're farming out here on this

1373
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,420
alkaline soil

1374
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:35,039
and you water with Ditch water that is

1375
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,079
run off from all the other Farms by the

1376
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:39,119
time it gets to you and it's high in

1377
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:40,140
alkalinity not just pH and I know they

1378
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,700
sound the same

1379
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:43,259
but you can do more research on water

1380
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:45,358
and I'm certainly not an expert I just

1381
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:47,819
know enough to be dangerous that

1382
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:50,159
alkalinity is actually the problem not

1383
00:46:47,818 --> 00:46:51,719
the pH it's that it's bicarbonate that's

1384
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:53,639
in there and chlorides that's in there

1385
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:55,439
and maybe some magnesium sodium that's

1386
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:57,358
just jacking the ph and so you go water

1387
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,280
with it and it's not like the high pH

1388
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:01,139
water is the problem it's the fact that

1389
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,000
we are already fairly alkaline and the

1390
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:04,799
biology and your cover crop finally

1391
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,139
released some calcium from the calcium

1392
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,960
carbonate and the plant root is about to

1393
00:47:07,139 --> 00:47:11,699
access readily available calcium and the

1394
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,740
water that comes in is full of carbonate

1395
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:16,139
and binds up into calcium carbonate the

1396
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:17,399
plant can't get it anymore so when the

1397
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:19,980
biology is trying to do all this work

1398
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,539
and our water stops IT and binds and

1399
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:24,119
makes other chemicals and is constantly

1400
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:26,099
causing issues pH is a concern and

1401
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:28,740
what's interesting is that acidifying an

1402
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:30,359
alkaline soil actually eliminates those

1403
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:32,879
carbonates that are the problem not

1404
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:34,318
really the ph and so now the calcium

1405
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,119
stays available

1406
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:38,400
and so I find it fascinating that

1407
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:40,200
there's so much to learn about water and

1408
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,700
I will say none of it matters when

1409
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:43,858
you're on regular water it's when you

1410
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:45,659
have well water ditch water things that

1411
00:47:43,858 --> 00:47:47,279
may have stuff in it that really messes

1412
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:49,920
with your soil and can build up over

1413
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,660
time it'd be very worthwhile to go to

1414
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,220
Logan Labs out of Ohio go to

1415
00:47:51,659 --> 00:47:55,980
loganlabs.com

1416
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:57,358
and go to their Water Analysis print out

1417
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,740
a report call them whatever you got to

1418
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:00,900
do and then you put the water in a

1419
00:47:58,739 --> 00:48:02,699
bottle you mail it to them and they give

1420
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,619
you an analysis and they'll tell you

1421
00:48:02,699 --> 00:48:05,879
here's everything and even if you don't

1422
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:07,619
know about a water test you can just

1423
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,880
take the recommended numbers and compare

1424
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:10,440
and see where you're high or low and

1425
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,640
then make some guesses and then maybe do

1426
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,980
some research

1427
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:15,598
but um what's interesting about the the

1428
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:18,179
person that you're saying asked the

1429
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:21,720
question is they're on tap water it's

1430
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:23,759
it's fairly rare to see such high pH out

1431
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:27,299
of the tap because most municipalities

1432
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:30,119
have rules for what will ruin the pipes

1433
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:31,859
and what's good for humans and so I

1434
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:33,420
wonder if that tap is connected to a

1435
00:48:31,858 --> 00:48:35,699
well and that's why it's it's really

1436
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:37,740
well watered but it's his tap water in

1437
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:39,960
which case you'd have to do a water test

1438
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:42,059
because if that's just some minerals

1439
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,619
that are you know non-problematic it

1440
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:45,000
could be the heat is Waters with it it's

1441
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:46,680
fine

1442
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,019
um it used to be that the living soil

1443
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:50,639
Growers would use AG cell 16h like every

1444
00:48:49,019 --> 00:48:52,619
watering even though it's not organic

1445
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:53,639
but it's made from Sand so none of us

1446
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:55,500
really cared

1447
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:57,420
um but that's like 11 pH and when you

1448
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,800
check your water after adding it's like

1449
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,059
nine and people would water every time

1450
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,619
and they'd be like this pH doesn't

1451
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:03,599
matter

1452
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:05,640
um and I think partially the The Mulch

1453
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,980
layer and the volume of soil it could

1454
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:10,318
definitely fix a lot of those issues

1455
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:12,059
but in a smaller container with 9 pH if

1456
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:14,039
it's full of a problem it'll it'll be

1457
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:16,400
realized fairly quickly a big bed of

1458
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:19,440
soil might buffer it so it's a non-issue

1459
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,539
you can reverse osmosis that and a lot

1460
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,700
of people say don't use Ro

1461
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:25,559
I agree because it's wasteful it takes

1462
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:27,358
part of the water and discards it and

1463
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:30,239
it's slow and it's you know fairly

1464
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:32,880
expensive but it does fix the water and

1465
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:34,559
in living soil you don't like it'll work

1466
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,358
just fine Ro is not going to hurt

1467
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,039
anything it's just more like maybe not

1468
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:40,078
the best way to do it

1469
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:42,119
um so that's an answer without a soil

1470
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,318
test you could just Ro it and you know

1471
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:44,940
if it's sodium in there you're not going

1472
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:46,380
to filter it you'll have to ro it and

1473
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,539
then the sodium is gone and your plants

1474
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:49,920
are going to grow like crazy in the

1475
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:51,300
meantime if you're really worried you

1476
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,858
can just go buy some water and use that

1477
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,780
until you get your water tested it's

1478
00:49:52,858 --> 00:49:57,420
kind of a pain to Lug water around but

1479
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:59,280
at least you know and if this was just

1480
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:02,338
tap water it was 8 pH or something I

1481
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,900
would just use it and and see you could

1482
00:50:02,338 --> 00:50:05,460
always buy water use it on some plants

1483
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,500
and use your tap water in one and kind

1484
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:10,500
of decide going forward

1485
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:14,159
um but I I guess the gist of this is it

1486
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:16,980
depends right there's no one right

1487
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:18,480
answer for you and so I will say pH

1488
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,940
should not matter but when you have

1489
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,380
water that you know is problematic it

1490
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:24,179
returns to the equine Asian and it's

1491
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,280
important to have good water so do you

1492
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:28,679
recommend checking the soil PH would

1493
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,900
like either one of those blue lab probes

1494
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:33,179
that go right into the medium or doing a

1495
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:35,579
runoff pH test when growing what the

1496
00:50:33,179 --> 00:50:38,639
organic inputs yeah

1497
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:40,260
um I mean it depends right if you know

1498
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:41,519
nothing and you don't know where the

1499
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:43,319
soil is from then you're just trying to

1500
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:45,300
figure out a baseline maybe getting a

1501
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:47,219
lot of measurements on it would be good

1502
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:49,619
but for instance

1503
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:51,838
I might have a high pH just from having

1504
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:54,358
lots of calcium in there and the soil

1505
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:56,039
not really being used in wet you probe

1506
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:57,000
it and you're freshly potting up and it

1507
00:50:56,039 --> 00:50:58,619
reads a little high and you start

1508
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,059
tinkering with adjusting the ph and you

1509
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:03,059
mess something up

1510
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:05,579
where a lot of times

1511
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:07,740
you know you send it to the lab and it

1512
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:09,240
might be a slightly high pH but you know

1513
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:11,459
a lot of our crops like a higher pH

1514
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:13,139
above neutral and it's fine and so we

1515
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,460
shouldn't freak out living soil like I

1516
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:17,460
mentioned the root tip and everything

1517
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:18,780
has a way to buffer and so that enables

1518
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,338
us to

1519
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:22,559
take advantage of the buffering

1520
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:23,759
qualities of the soil like in Hydro if

1521
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,319
you're not exactly in the pH the

1522
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,200
nutrient won't go into the plant but in

1523
00:51:25,318 --> 00:51:28,800
soil we have a lot of buffer room

1524
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:31,679
um

1525
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:35,339
and so I think that that does change

1526
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:38,219
things a lot so how about EC or people

1527
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:39,838
some people do PPM would you monitor

1528
00:51:38,219 --> 00:51:41,399
that I recommend people monitor that

1529
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:43,858
when they're growing with Organic inputs

1530
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,720
no I mean some outdoor Growers some

1531
00:51:43,858 --> 00:51:49,318
Growers do when they're making a lot of

1532
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:50,399
um teas and solutions and I won't I'm

1533
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:54,239
not going to say that you're trying to

1534
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,980
Target some PPM some EC level but it

1535
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,239
gives you some indication like if you

1536
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,920
are a grower and you just fly to someone

1537
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:00,838
else's farm for the first time and

1538
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,338
you've used these tools you could go oh

1539
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:04,078
the water's pretty clean it doesn't have

1540
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:05,639
a lot in it I have my meters it tells me

1541
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,280
what's going on and you might be able to

1542
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:10,259
get up to speed faster but

1543
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,540
um probing the soil PH like I said may

1544
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,859
not really tell you as much in the sense

1545
00:52:12,539 --> 00:52:15,420
that a lot of people would test the

1546
00:52:13,858 --> 00:52:16,558
runoff and I'm like well they run off

1547
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,659
man have nothing to do with what the

1548
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,599
soil so we'd recommend a slurry test

1549
00:52:18,659 --> 00:52:22,980
and under those PH meters work but

1550
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,720
um I kind of lost track when I was

1551
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,338
talking the last time but when it comes

1552
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:27,838
to the pH if you send your soil to a lab

1553
00:52:26,338 --> 00:52:29,338
and they tell you why

1554
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:31,318
sometimes there's just a little bit too

1555
00:52:29,338 --> 00:52:33,960
too much magnesium in there and it Jacks

1556
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:36,659
your pH but but it can be dealt with and

1557
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:38,579
so just getting the pH reading on its

1558
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:39,598
own although it might be valuable it

1559
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:40,980
doesn't really tell you how to fix

1560
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,099
anything and so now you're just going

1561
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:45,480
whoa do I PH down my water not if it's

1562
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:47,460
sodium in your soil that's causing the

1563
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,159
high ph and sodium and magnesium can

1564
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:51,960
just Jack your pH really high

1565
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:53,879
um and so what we typically recommend is

1566
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,139
if you're seeing a high pH in the soil

1567
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:57,000
and you've tested it now you're

1568
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:59,338
convinced that there's a problem you can

1569
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,838
use a tablespoon of gypsum and a four or

1570
00:52:59,338 --> 00:53:02,338
five gallon bucket of water and you can

1571
00:53:00,838 --> 00:53:04,380
Leach that through the soil to there's

1572
00:53:02,338 --> 00:53:06,119
good amount of runoff and the sulfur

1573
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,400
that's in the gypsum will rip the

1574
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:10,920
excesses out of the soil and flush them

1575
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,680
out and replace them with calcium and a

1576
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:16,139
high pH soil that's high calcium crushes

1577
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,239
a high pH soil that's got magnesium and

1578
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:21,179
sodium and potassium which is terrible

1579
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:22,739
so it's not always the ph and that's why

1580
00:53:21,179 --> 00:53:25,019
I recommend sending it to a lab so we

1581
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:26,118
can see what built that pH what does it

1582
00:53:25,019 --> 00:53:30,420
consist of

1583
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:32,519
but the EC and the PPM meters I know

1584
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:34,260
some people that they're like wow this

1585
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:36,358
recipe I make with the compost tea it

1586
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:38,040
works so well every time they'll get a

1587
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:39,179
reading and maybe next time they do it

1588
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:40,679
they'll see if the reading is the same

1589
00:53:39,179 --> 00:53:43,558
and they'll start to share that as kind

1590
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:45,058
of a baseline but right away you can see

1591
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:46,559
some crazy readings in some of these

1592
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:49,260
Organic Solutions and it doesn't really

1593
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:52,140
mean that it's plant available and so um

1594
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:54,119
in my daily life I don't use a phec any

1595
00:53:52,139 --> 00:53:55,739
of that pretty much ever so

1596
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:58,140
yeah I've been pretty hands off ever

1597
00:53:55,739 --> 00:54:00,539
since I've been using organic inputs is

1598
00:53:58,139 --> 00:54:03,420
I haven't really needed to check the PPM

1599
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:04,858
or the pH at all really

1600
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:07,740
I mean there's people that test the pH

1601
00:54:04,858 --> 00:54:09,000
of their saliva and of their urine and

1602
00:54:07,739 --> 00:54:10,919
they try and eat foods that are more

1603
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,659
alkaline causing to put themselves in a

1604
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,760
healthy condition

1605
00:54:12,659 --> 00:54:16,139
I'd say 99 of those stop doing after a

1606
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,700
few days and just eat healthy and decide

1607
00:54:16,139 --> 00:54:19,019
this whole thing's bullshitous food is

1608
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:21,838
good food like why do I need to control

1609
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:23,338
all of it you know I think that's when

1610
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:25,019
we're looking for a shortcut like is

1611
00:54:23,338 --> 00:54:26,779
there one food that'll fix all the

1612
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:29,159
problems that I have it's like no

1613
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:30,660
alkaline food or healthy foods just

1614
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:34,318
throw the chart away I need healthy

1615
00:54:30,659 --> 00:54:36,058
right let's move on to another topic

1616
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:38,099
here I want to get your thoughts on

1617
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:40,380
sugars so a lot of people are adding in

1618
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:42,240
Molasses for example some people use

1619
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:44,579
honey or brown sugar what's your overall

1620
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:45,719
opinion on adding sugars in throughout

1621
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:48,539
the growth cycle

1622
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:50,818
you know um this is one I'm not an

1623
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:52,739
expert on and I have my opinion and I'll

1624
00:54:50,818 --> 00:54:54,838
share it with you and it's based on you

1625
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:56,219
know the last 10 years of build a soil

1626
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:58,078
and previous to that just growing for

1627
00:54:56,219 --> 00:55:00,358
myself and

1628
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,700
um I think a lot of it was Hydroponics

1629
00:55:00,358 --> 00:55:04,380
grow stores selling sweeteners that made

1630
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:07,739
sense because you're like I want oozing

1631
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:09,119
sweet resin and I want flavor and so it

1632
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:10,858
just makes sense the human mind is like

1633
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,960
oh yeah that'd be good I mean you'd hear

1634
00:55:10,858 --> 00:55:14,639
people adding Kool-Aid to their water to

1635
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,519
get more grape flavor out of it you know

1636
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:18,358
it's just like there's just so much out

1637
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:19,800
there

1638
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:21,659
um and a lot of it comes from the best

1639
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,760
intention as far as our thought process

1640
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:26,219
like even Flushing

1641
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,980
I get flushing the medium but you're not

1642
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:30,899
going to go pull a non-mobile nutrient

1643
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:32,639
that's in an elemental form that it's

1644
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,420
not it's plant and pull it out like a

1645
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:34,980
straw

1646
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:37,200
and so

1647
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:38,940
um there's lots of considerations there

1648
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:41,279
but um

1649
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:44,818
yeah just

1650
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,140
I have a hard time thinking that certain

1651
00:55:44,818 --> 00:55:47,940
sugars are going to make a difference so

1652
00:55:46,139 --> 00:55:49,558
let me bring it all back around glucose

1653
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,639
fructose sucrose there's all these

1654
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:52,559
different percentages and different

1655
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:54,539
ingredients that you might add coconut

1656
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:57,000
water is one of my favorites it's got a

1657
00:55:54,539 --> 00:55:58,858
good number of all of those but the

1658
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,780
reason why we use the coconut is not

1659
00:55:58,858 --> 00:56:02,400
because of the sugar I mean it may be

1660
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:04,500
one of the big benefits but it's because

1661
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,420
we've researched the coconut and it's

1662
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:08,579
human health impact and all the enzymes

1663
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:10,318
that are in this big seed or droop and

1664
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:12,539
the liquid that's in there has not yet

1665
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:14,099
formed the coconut it's like the elixir

1666
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:16,800
of life and it happens to be full of

1667
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:18,420
sugars because biology sugars they need

1668
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,700
I mean sugar is like the energy of the

1669
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,500
sun when you look at the plant

1670
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:24,598
and it's producing what we call root

1671
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,699
exudates and it's feeding the soil it's

1672
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:28,440
basically feeding liquid carbon which is

1673
00:56:26,699 --> 00:56:30,239
a sugar to the soil

1674
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,099
and it's incredible but when we just

1675
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:33,838
start dumping sugars in we may be

1676
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:35,280
stimulating biological responses that

1677
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:36,960
the plant wasn't looking for when it's

1678
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,380
supposed to be in control of its sugar

1679
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:42,059
production to the soil and so I

1680
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:43,858
typically see people using sugars more

1681
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:45,240
in a compost tea

1682
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:47,759
and the goal of the compost tea

1683
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:49,979
originally so you all know was that we

1684
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,200
were not making a nutrient tea at all we

1685
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,940
were trying to take microorganisms shake

1686
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:56,039
them off of the compost by bubbling them

1687
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:58,139
have enough air in there to stimulate

1688
00:56:56,039 --> 00:57:00,239
them to be alive and happy and give them

1689
00:56:58,139 --> 00:57:02,639
a food source that they could devour in

1690
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:04,799
doing so you'd multiply billions of them

1691
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:07,379
and if you did the timing just right

1692
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:09,059
you've got the most diversity before all

1693
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:11,400
of those strong ones ate the weak ones

1694
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:12,839
and you'd pour that on your soil but the

1695
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,000
goal with the sugar being used in the

1696
00:57:12,838 --> 00:57:16,920
compost tea was to fully

1697
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,719
finish the sugar before you applied it

1698
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,880
to the soil meaning the microorganisms

1699
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,679
devoured it not the soil

1700
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,300
and so sticking to that a lot of us

1701
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:26,039
weren't like looking to just go dump

1702
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,599
molasses on the soil it was more just a

1703
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:29,579
compost tea thing

1704
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,619
and molasses has been used for a long

1705
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:34,260
time it's got other trace minerals in it

1706
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:36,420
it's got some other benefits

1707
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:38,280
um and the other thing that that came

1708
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,900
out was a lot of the compost tea Brewers

1709
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,640
from The Elaine Ingham crowd would say

1710
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,440
you can't add molasses it's going to

1711
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:45,358
feed the wrong microorganisms and then

1712
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,338
you're going to hurt your plant I've

1713
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:49,739
never seen that happen but I definitely

1714
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:51,358
agree and understand that certain food

1715
00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:53,879
inputs might stimulate certain

1716
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:56,759
populations of microbes versus others

1717
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,740
but in my mind plants produce sugars and

1718
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,680
so I don't think they can be bad just

1719
00:57:58,739 --> 00:58:02,759
throw the baby out with the bath water

1720
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:04,739
personally I use a little coconut water

1721
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,480
I would not be scared to add a molasses

1722
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:08,219
occasionally but I would avoid adding

1723
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,960
sugars all the time and I certainly

1724
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:11,519
wouldn't buy a sugar that says pineapple

1725
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,900
or banana or like some flavor that it's

1726
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:14,460
going to impart I don't think that's a

1727
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,960
benefit

1728
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,280
um and then when you look at Molasses

1729
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,079
like at the Growth Store oftentimes it's

1730
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,579
the cheapest molasses because you can

1731
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:22,380
feed it to animals they get beet

1732
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:24,720
molasses they water it down so it's easy

1733
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:25,980
to pour and they make a good margin if

1734
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:27,659
you go to the grocery store and buy

1735
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:30,179
organic molasses that's fairly expensive

1736
00:58:27,659 --> 00:58:32,159
in a little bottle so we carry a bulk

1737
00:58:30,179 --> 00:58:35,338
supply of organic sugar cane molasses

1738
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:37,259
that's you know better quality but

1739
00:58:35,338 --> 00:58:38,578
um I don't think it's necessary I think

1740
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,200
the plants are going to produce its own

1741
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:42,200
sugars if you're growing cover crop

1742
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:45,298
they're going to be putting sugars out

1743
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:47,578
and using them in a compost tea great if

1744
00:58:45,298 --> 00:58:48,960
you'd like to experiment with it I think

1745
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:50,940
one of the reasons why the coconut water

1746
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,818
works as a finisher is because it's high

1747
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:56,159
potassium not just that it's high sugar

1748
00:58:53,818 --> 00:58:58,858
and historically when it comes to like

1749
00:58:56,159 --> 00:59:00,420
nutrient growing not living soil you'd

1750
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:02,460
start heavy and phosphorus and finish

1751
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:04,920
strong in potassium and that's the

1752
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:06,720
methodology even in knf that kind of

1753
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,280
discuss some of these things so

1754
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:10,139
maybe that's part of the benefit that

1755
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,400
we're seeing right

1756
00:59:10,139 --> 00:59:13,318
um

1757
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,579
I I hope that answers your question did

1758
00:59:13,318 --> 00:59:16,558
you you have like a specific it does

1759
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:18,059
Point like the coast here

1760
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,859
no I just wanted to get kind of your

1761
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:22,200
overall thoughts on I've been using I

1762
00:59:19,858 --> 00:59:25,259
used to use molasses all the time and uh

1763
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:26,699
I find myself using it less and less you

1764
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,740
know really I've been just using the

1765
00:59:26,699 --> 00:59:31,618
build soil craft blend been using that

1766
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:33,419
one cup per plant every 30 days and it's

1767
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:35,880
been getting me through the growth so by

1768
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:37,858
becoming more and more hands-off as the

1769
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,838
years have gone on and molasses is one

1770
00:59:37,858 --> 00:59:41,699
of those things that have just have

1771
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:44,039
stopped doing yeah and you don't need to

1772
00:59:41,699 --> 00:59:45,239
replace it with another cost and

1773
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:46,798
um craft Planet it's funny because I'm

1774
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:48,539
the same way I never thought I'd I like

1775
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:50,579
any individual ingredients but you don't

1776
00:59:48,539 --> 00:59:52,079
have 20 big 50 pound bags at your house

1777
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:53,579
and scooping out of all of them so the

1778
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,160
craft one I'm the same way I take it

1779
00:59:53,579 --> 00:59:57,900
home I use it for most things but the

1780
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:00,598
coconut water is probably my still last

1781
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,980
sugar that I that I use but when I think

1782
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:05,099
of it I don't think of sugar I just

1783
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:07,318
think of freeze-dried liquid enzymatic

1784
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:08,880
coconut you know but I can't put enzymes

1785
01:00:07,318 --> 01:00:10,500
on the label and me trying to test how

1786
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,700
long the enzymes are alive and all this

1787
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:14,400
stuff

1788
01:00:11,699 --> 01:00:16,379
um I mean early on there was a forum the

1789
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,940
living organic soil forum and that was

1790
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:20,519
through Afghanistan that we started

1791
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:21,720
after I see mag closed and

1792
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:23,159
um one of the arguments in there was how

1793
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:24,838
can you guarantee enzymes in the Coconut

1794
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:26,578
it dies immediately and we found white

1795
01:00:24,838 --> 01:00:27,960
papers that would show that it survived

1796
01:00:26,579 --> 01:00:29,640
but these white papers would keep it

1797
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:31,500
Frozen the whole time

1798
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:33,838
so I don't want people to think they're

1799
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:35,880
guaranteed enzymes but the most direct

1800
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:38,039
replacement for a sprouted seed tea

1801
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:41,160
which we discussed would be coconut

1802
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:42,900
water it's the seed it's the inside the

1803
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:44,279
liquid that we're all after even human I

1804
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:46,260
mean human health there's a million

1805
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:48,720
articles on drinking coconut water for

1806
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:50,640
human health and so it's basically a

1807
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:52,798
human sprouted ziti like it and so you

1808
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:54,179
can use that as well the problem is

1809
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:56,940
people would go buy like harmless

1810
01:00:54,179 --> 01:00:58,558
harvest the best freshest coconut water

1811
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:00,659
you're spending like eight dollars to

1812
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:03,000
like spray your plants I mean so the

1813
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:04,739
freeze-dried makes a lot more sense so

1814
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,260
or if you live where there's coconuts

1815
01:01:04,739 --> 01:01:08,459
right that's even better I'll have to

1816
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,260
try out the coconut water I haven't

1817
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,699
tried that yet uh and if anybody's

1818
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,260
wondering more about the craft blend we

1819
01:01:11,699 --> 01:01:15,539
actually talked about that in length in

1820
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,859
the last episode so the previous episode

1821
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:18,539
we did together will definitely be

1822
01:01:16,858 --> 01:01:20,159
linked down in the YouTube description

1823
01:01:18,539 --> 01:01:21,659
section below as well a couple more

1824
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:23,639
things I want to get into before I let

1825
01:01:21,659 --> 01:01:25,858
you go here one of them I want to get

1826
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:27,539
into is worms so worms is something I've

1827
01:01:25,858 --> 01:01:29,940
added into my garden I had the red

1828
01:01:27,539 --> 01:01:31,199
wigglers and European night crawlers I

1829
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:33,059
know a lot of people use the African

1830
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:34,980
nightcrawlers as well but talk to us

1831
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:36,900
about incorporating worms into the

1832
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:38,760
garden this goes back with our whole

1833
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:40,559
theme right there's mulch we talked

1834
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,140
about seed teas because of enzymes and

1835
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:45,000
that natural process worms don't just

1836
01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:46,980
walk up to food and start eating it what

1837
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,019
they do is they rub up next to it they

1838
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:50,760
have a mucous membrane that exudes these

1839
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:52,980
enzymes that are in response to the

1840
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:55,079
material that it's next to so if you

1841
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:57,358
make a worm bin and you fill it full of

1842
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:59,280
maybe phosphorus Rich material you'll be

1843
01:01:57,358 --> 01:02:01,619
getting more phosphatase enzyme to break

1844
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:04,440
that down once the enzyme does its job

1845
01:02:01,619 --> 01:02:07,260
the worm can then absorb through its gut

1846
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:09,599
that material that's all bacteria broken

1847
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:12,540
down and sludge now and then it can

1848
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:14,160
improve and utilize it for its own life

1849
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:16,259
and what comes out is actually usually

1850
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:19,318
better than what started and so the

1851
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:20,940
worms have unbelievable benefits now I

1852
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:24,298
will put the caveat that they are an

1853
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:28,019
Invader of the United States our forests

1854
01:02:24,298 --> 01:02:29,519
were built by fungi and the worms came I

1855
01:02:28,019 --> 01:02:31,559
believe down from Canada it could be

1856
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:33,298
getting this all wrong but when they're

1857
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:35,640
now in the forest layer they eat that

1858
01:02:33,298 --> 01:02:36,960
mulch too quickly and that's no good for

1859
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:38,940
the trees because they're relying on it

1860
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:41,280
for banks of years of nutrition and the

1861
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:42,960
worms can just devour it so it's great

1862
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,760
for us that are growing fast growing

1863
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,099
annual plants because we want that

1864
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:48,660
nutrition on tap and the worms are

1865
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:50,700
phenomenal in our vegetable Greenhouse

1866
01:02:48,659 --> 01:02:52,739
when my wife just produces these rows of

1867
01:02:50,699 --> 01:02:54,659
tall Tomatoes all that's under there is

1868
01:02:52,739 --> 01:02:56,639
some craft blend and some nutrients and

1869
01:02:54,659 --> 01:02:57,899
the worms they go pull it down and they

1870
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:59,879
bring it into the soil and make it

1871
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,559
available to the plants it's like this

1872
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,940
engine that produces this constant

1873
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:04,680
nutrient Supply

1874
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:07,798
and it's faster than just waiting for it

1875
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:09,659
to decompose so worms are great we used

1876
01:03:07,798 --> 01:03:12,059
to recommend the worms the red ones and

1877
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:13,739
the night crawlers I tend to lately just

1878
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:15,960
prefer the red wigglers nightcrawlers

1879
01:03:13,739 --> 01:03:18,058
are fine our our thought process was the

1880
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:20,159
red wiggler stamp top the night crawlers

1881
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:21,720
go everywhere but now I kind of like

1882
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:23,578
just I just like them in the top I don't

1883
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:25,919
turn it all into a worm bin the red

1884
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:28,200
wigglers stay more where the food is and

1885
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,480
it seems to work really really well but

1886
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:32,039
I'd imagine all of them are fine if you

1887
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,079
go dig around your property and clay

1888
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:36,239
soil you'll find earthworms that aren't

1889
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:38,160
a composting type of worm and those may

1890
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:40,199
not be of the same benefit because

1891
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:41,338
they're more for compaction and things

1892
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:43,618
they're not really going to break down

1893
01:03:41,338 --> 01:03:45,058
material as fast

1894
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:46,740
um but I think the thing to take away is

1895
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:49,019
that they're part of that enzymatic

1896
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:50,519
puzzle they create enzymes they help

1897
01:03:49,019 --> 01:03:52,679
break down that organic matter that

1898
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:54,239
lives in the mulch layer and that turns

1899
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:55,679
into plant food the last question we get

1900
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:57,298
is how many right that's the next

1901
01:03:55,679 --> 01:04:00,899
question how many do I

1902
01:03:57,298 --> 01:04:03,119
my my recommendation is that we want to

1903
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:05,400
put less than you need let the worms

1904
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:07,619
multiply to homeostasis where they're

1905
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,780
happy and that size soil container you

1906
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:12,119
have if you do the reverse and you say

1907
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:13,619
above five are good or 100 are good I'll

1908
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:16,079
put a whole pound I just bought online

1909
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:17,160
in my one container and partially

1910
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,359
because you're like what do I do with

1911
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:20,159
the rest of the worms if I don't use the

1912
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:22,440
whole pound we'll start a warm bit and

1913
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:24,480
then you have a Perpetual Source but if

1914
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,760
you put a pound of worms which is the

1915
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,500
Thousand red wigglers on average into a

1916
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,420
small container of soil you're going to

1917
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,980
turn that into worm casting so fast the

1918
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:33,900
worms are going to overpopulate start

1919
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:35,760
ditching and climbing out dying and so

1920
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:37,318
I'd rather not start with too many and

1921
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:40,500
have them die into what's balanced I'd

1922
01:04:37,318 --> 01:04:42,539
rather start with even two 10 20 50 a

1923
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:44,699
handful and let them multiply to what's

1924
01:04:42,539 --> 01:04:46,798
perfect for your soil so that's my

1925
01:04:44,699 --> 01:04:49,679
thought yeah I actually started a worm

1926
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:51,298
bin year year and a half ago now and I

1927
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:52,618
haven't looked back you know I free

1928
01:04:51,298 --> 01:04:53,880
worms I said well I made that one

1929
01:04:52,619 --> 01:04:55,019
investment right to get the worms to

1930
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,059
begin but now you can just grab them

1931
01:04:55,019 --> 01:04:59,519
Wherever Whenever yeah you have a bunny

1932
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:01,260
come over you're like yeah some worms

1933
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:03,599
okay I'm from the worm bin and put him

1934
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:05,339
into my pots whenever I want so yeah

1935
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:07,798
definitely worth it in my opinion okay

1936
01:05:05,338 --> 01:05:10,380
so towards the end of the grow you

1937
01:05:07,798 --> 01:05:12,179
believe in a fade or senescence at the

1938
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:14,579
end of the growth cycle right now do you

1939
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:16,440
believe in leaching or flushing when

1940
01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:18,420
growing organically and let me Define

1941
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:20,400
those two real quick because there's so

1942
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:23,400
many definitions out there leaching

1943
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:25,500
defined as not feeding any organic

1944
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:29,400
inputs for the final few weeks of the

1945
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:31,139
plant's life and flushing as defined as

1946
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,880
running a large amount of water through

1947
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:35,159
the medium in order to reduce the

1948
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:37,260
nutrition to starve the plant should

1949
01:05:35,159 --> 01:05:39,118
Growers Leach or flush their soil at the

1950
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:40,799
end of the growth cycle no I would

1951
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,539
actually switch those two but what

1952
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:44,699
you're saying is fine meaning when most

1953
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:47,159
people say flush they're like in Hydro

1954
01:05:44,699 --> 01:05:49,500
they switch to no nutrients yeah

1955
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:50,879
absolutely definitions right but

1956
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:53,159
leaching traditionally means you're

1957
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:55,079
leaching out your your gra everything

1958
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:57,058
has to come out on a farm you leech you

1959
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:58,920
don't flush but as long as we're clear

1960
01:05:57,059 --> 01:06:01,140
on what we're talking about I agree with

1961
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:02,880
neither and what I mean by this is that

1962
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:04,798
we worked really hard to build this soil

1963
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,119
up and one of the benefits of living

1964
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:08,579
soil is that you see the genetic

1965
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:09,900
potential and the genetic potential what

1966
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:11,700
I mean by that is it's going to

1967
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:13,079
determine on its own when the end of its

1968
01:06:11,699 --> 01:06:15,000
life is and it's going to start to

1969
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:16,740
senesce regardless whether it's

1970
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,239
fertility in the soil or not

1971
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:19,858
part of what may help this is some

1972
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,358
colder temperatures slowing the biology

1973
01:06:19,858 --> 01:06:23,338
down and the release of nutrients

1974
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:25,500
something we'll use cold water to do

1975
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:27,058
that and that also stimulates some of

1976
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:29,159
the colors and some of the mimicry of

1977
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:30,440
Colder season coming into winter and to

1978
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:34,019
the Harvest

1979
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:35,818
but getting that runoff it's not going

1980
01:06:34,019 --> 01:06:38,519
to change anything

1981
01:06:35,818 --> 01:06:40,679
um it I think that the thought is that

1982
01:06:38,519 --> 01:06:42,599
you run it off so hard that your soil is

1983
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:44,038
now devoid of nutrient and now the plant

1984
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:47,099
must starve

1985
01:06:44,039 --> 01:06:48,720
but this is like saying someone who's 90

1986
01:06:47,099 --> 01:06:49,980
on their deathbed is going to eat all

1987
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:51,659
your Thanksgiving dinner they don't even

1988
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:53,460
like it's not even a thought the plant

1989
01:06:51,659 --> 01:06:55,920
is dying on its own it's gonna stop

1990
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:57,720
taking food up okay I think you could

1991
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,700
probably stop watering

1992
01:06:57,719 --> 01:07:01,858
the last week or two and a big bed of

1993
01:06:59,699 --> 01:07:03,538
soil it has plenty of water and it just

1994
01:07:01,858 --> 01:07:05,639
doesn't need as much now that it's

1995
01:07:03,539 --> 01:07:08,099
ripening it's done growing basically at

1996
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:09,838
that point and you'll notice because in

1997
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:11,220
Hydro if you pick the genetic and grew

1998
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:13,679
it and maybe you weren't familiar with

1999
01:07:11,219 --> 01:07:15,000
exactly when it should be harvested at a

2000
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:17,338
certain point you're going to say oh the

2001
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,079
schedule says switch to flush well guess

2002
01:07:17,338 --> 01:07:21,538
what it's going to send a sense it's

2003
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:24,599
going to start to fade because it has no

2004
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:26,039
choice but when you're living soil I

2005
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:27,420
like to give it that choice and it may

2006
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:30,359
not start to fade on week seven or eight

2007
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:32,579
it may fade on week 10 but it does it

2008
01:07:30,358 --> 01:07:33,900
and it does it because it's done and at

2009
01:07:32,579 --> 01:07:35,760
that point you know you've maxed out

2010
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:37,200
your genetic potential you've gotten all

2011
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,119
of the different terpenes and flavors

2012
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:40,980
and everything that you want peaked out

2013
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:43,140
and you're you're finished and so I do

2014
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:45,240
like to see the fade I will see I see

2015
01:07:43,139 --> 01:07:47,098
say I see difference in some genetics

2016
01:07:45,239 --> 01:07:48,838
quadrant two in our YouTube series right

2017
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:50,400
now I just took a video

2018
01:07:48,838 --> 01:07:52,139
um one's dark purple and leathery

2019
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,358
looking and the other one's faded ye

2020
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:56,358
lime yellow and green and so they both

2021
01:07:54,358 --> 01:07:58,920
senest in their own ways

2022
01:07:56,358 --> 01:08:01,440
but flushing would maybe take that

2023
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:03,960
purple and tone it down just a bit like

2024
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:05,700
running water through or just plain but

2025
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:08,039
I don't think that's a benefit in living

2026
01:08:05,699 --> 01:08:09,598
soil and that turns me back to saying

2027
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:11,640
like look at what's in the plant is

2028
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:13,200
already in the plant pouring water on

2029
01:08:11,639 --> 01:08:15,659
the media is not going to change that

2030
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:17,519
what it can do is if there's nothing in

2031
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:18,960
the soil at all and you've prematurely

2032
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,400
taken everything out of the soil because

2033
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,480
you leached and flushed and all those

2034
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:23,460
things

2035
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:25,259
well now the plant is going to mobilize

2036
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:27,420
nutrients from its Leaf anything mobile

2037
01:08:25,259 --> 01:08:28,920
into the bud it's going to use that as

2038
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:31,079
food but guess what it's still eating

2039
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,279
it's just it's just eating its own

2040
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:34,619
leaves

2041
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:36,600
um so I still feel like it's kind of a

2042
01:08:34,619 --> 01:08:38,939
viewpoint but um

2043
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,440
I do say harvesting a dark green plant

2044
01:08:38,939 --> 01:08:42,479
early because it wasn't finished it's

2045
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:44,219
not as good as a finished product

2046
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:46,318
I'm not saying that it's because it was

2047
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:49,020
faded but finishing that plant properly

2048
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:51,179
whether it was a light fade or whether

2049
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:53,040
it stayed somewhat perky green as long

2050
01:08:51,179 --> 01:08:55,199
as it showed you that it was finished I

2051
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:57,000
get great great results out of the end

2052
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:59,338
material

2053
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,838
um and you know there's other tricks too

2054
01:08:59,338 --> 01:09:02,939
like tomatoes if you know it's getting

2055
01:09:00,838 --> 01:09:04,920
really cold you can actually just go cut

2056
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:06,659
the top off of it and it'll force it to

2057
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:08,539
finish fruiting faster so that you get

2058
01:09:06,659 --> 01:09:11,399
tomatoes before they freeze

2059
01:09:08,539 --> 01:09:13,738
all plants kind of have a reaction to

2060
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:16,019
trying to produce and stay alive

2061
01:09:13,738 --> 01:09:17,939
finish their job and to come in there

2062
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:19,380
and start to just dump water or pretend

2063
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:22,019
like you have to flush I don't think

2064
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:24,600
there's any reason to do so so well said

2065
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:26,160
well Jeremy we have covered a ton of

2066
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:28,140
different topics in such a short period

2067
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:29,880
of time and I have a list of other

2068
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:31,140
topics that we could get into so if you

2069
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,640
guys want to see a part three maybe we

2070
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:34,798
can drag him back for a part three

2071
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,900
sometime this year maybe let us know

2072
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:38,880
down in the comment section below also

2073
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:40,920
list some questions you have for Jeremy

2074
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:43,259
maybe I can go over those in the next

2075
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:45,000
episode as well Jeremy tell the viewers

2076
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:46,198
how they can find you and is there

2077
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
anything upcoming in the future that you

2078
01:09:46,198 --> 01:09:49,500
want to talk about

2079
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,060
um nothing right now our soil is the

2080
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,679
best it's ever been it works

2081
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:54,239
phenomenally well we've gotten more

2082
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:56,340
quality control in the back end lots

2083
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:57,779
more testing and I'm just happy that we

2084
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:59,520
get to keep investing into this process

2085
01:09:57,779 --> 01:10:01,738
because it's making a better and better

2086
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,060
product for a customer and I get to

2087
01:10:01,738 --> 01:10:05,279
experience the benefits of that as well

2088
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:07,500
the way to find me is at buildersoil.com

2089
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:09,599
we've got really great team of support

2090
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:12,060
you can email support at buildersoil you

2091
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:14,640
can live chat go to our Instagram the

2092
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:16,440
main goal is that we want to provide the

2093
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,600
best quality ingredients to empower you

2094
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:20,339
and your grow and that has to come with

2095
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,659
the education so you use them properly

2096
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:23,159
and so you can check out our YouTube

2097
01:10:21,658 --> 01:10:25,139
channel as well which I know you've

2098
01:10:23,158 --> 01:10:27,839
mentioned but that's really everything

2099
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:29,699
it's simple we're just trying to have

2100
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,380
fun grow plants and as you turn this

2101
01:10:29,698 --> 01:10:33,719
into a hobby and you start to turn it

2102
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:35,340
into a passion it turns into a lot of

2103
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:37,619
questions and a lot of wonderment and a

2104
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:39,239
lot of research and so um these episodes

2105
01:10:37,619 --> 01:10:40,979
like when you get to ask me questions

2106
01:10:39,238 --> 01:10:42,718
they're so much better than just some

2107
01:10:40,979 --> 01:10:45,119
FAQ where I read it aloud there's some

2108
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:46,679
interaction and I think you you picked a

2109
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:49,140
lot of topics that were really good like

2110
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:50,699
