1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,240
coming up on garden talk when you get

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,080
open up that bag and it's loud those are

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,800
the terpenes and those are volatile

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,359
organic compounds and that is actually

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,040
what plants use to communicate that is

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,959
the plant's language

7
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,118
go ahead and spread that in your garden

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,519
and you're going to see a huge increase

9
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:22,000
in microbial diversity which will then

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,600
in turn increase your terpenes

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,879
bacteria are going to come up and

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,359
they're going to feed off of that

13
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:30,879
nitrogen source and once the green is

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,520
gone it becomes brown and that's carbon

15
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,200
and then the carbon feeds the fungus

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,000
it's amazing it's a full circle of life

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,920
there the reason why you should be

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,200
growing in living soil as organically as

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,920
possible

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,160
if not for the planet

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,160
for increased terpenes

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,039
what's up everybody if you that don't

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,320

00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,158
native soil ipm composting and a few

32
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,399
other topics now she's back for another

episode in this episode she talks about

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,200
terpenes and tips on maximizing terpenes

35
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,599

infiniti i have their inline fan ducting

50
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,478
and carbon filter i love the controller

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,320
with the temperature and humidity

52
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,879
programming and having control of

53
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,239
different fan speeds this makes it so

54
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,759
much easier to control my grow

55
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,719
environment and i can't wait for the

episode we did together but uh but yeah

95
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,799
that was a really really good one and i

96
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,318
don't know if you know this i might have

97
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,879
i'm trying to think if i dm do this or

98
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,878
not but you inspired me to start

99
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,000
composting yeah

100
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,079
i don't know if you remember that

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,400
conversation we had because i think i

102
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,799
mentioned like i don't compost and like

103
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,319
i'll never forget this is like it was

104
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,280
like a flip of a switch for you we were

105
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:59,199
like

106
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,280
you don't compost and you like you you

107
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,919
weren't like angry it was more like a

108
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,640
disappointment and it really hit me like

109
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:09,039
oh i need to start composting so i made

110
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,158
myself a vermicompost bin and i've been

111
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:14,560
composting for almost a year now so

112
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,959
that's thanks to you yay and this is

113
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,519
what i'm trying to do here change

114
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,160
people's perception and save the planet

115
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,680
one compost pile at a time

116
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,960
that's awesome but yeah we have a whole

117
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,720
bunch of good topics to dive into today

118
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,000
but first can you introduce yourself for

119
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,600
those that didn't catch the first

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,360
episode we did together

121
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,280
yeah definitely i'm alexandria irons aka

122
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,560
queen of the sun

123
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,599

i have a website queen of the

126
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,600
sungrown.com

127
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,759
when we spoke last i was still

128
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,960
commercially cultivating medicinal

129
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,960
plants

130
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,439
but at this time i've kind of changed

131
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,399
gears and completely am focusing on

132
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,040
education

133
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,038
consulting and traveling the country

134
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,080
helping people

135
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:06,000
grow cleaner quality medicine

136
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,000
awesome some super exciting stuff there

137
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,360
that's really really cool so what are we

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,319
going to dive into today i know you want

139
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,879
to talk all about terpenes which is a

140
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,879
topic that we haven't covered too much

141
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,719
on this podcast so i'm really interested

142
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,240
to hear what you have to say about them

143
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,680
so yeah just dive into it what do you

144
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,519
want to reveal to us today about

145
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,800
terpenes well

146
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,560
so

147
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,720
basically as a cultivator i see the big

148
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,600
paradigm of

149
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,080
indoor versus outdoor and we talk a lot

150
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,800
about the influence of

151
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,879
thc content versus terpene and the

152
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,960
entourage effect and all of these

153
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,839
different things come into play

154
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,959
um

155
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,959
and you know

156
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,359
i've really been pushing this living

157
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:53,439
sustainable living soil sustainable

158
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:56,800
gardening organic methods and

159
00:05:53,439 --> 00:06:00,719
the reason why you should be growing in

160
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,520
living soil as organically as possible

161
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,280
if not for the planet

162
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:10,478
for increased terpenes

163
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:13,198
terpenes are responsible for

164
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:17,360
the flavor the smell

165
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,120
they are what we would describe as loud

166
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,038
when you get open up that bag and it's

167
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,759
loud those are the terpenes

168
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:26,240
and those are volatile organic compounds

169
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,520
and that is actually what plants use to

170
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,800
communicate that is the plant's language

171
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,519
and so

172
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:38,240
we can see increased terpene synthesis

173
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:41,198
from plants by increasing biodiversity

174
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,879
so i'd love to talk about that

175
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,919
biodiversity

176
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,918
is basically you know the diversity of

177
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:51,120
biology that is present when a plant is

178
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:53,359
growing and so terpenes can change the

179
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,639
physiology of a plant as well as the

180
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,840
plants around it and so by increasing

181
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,759
your biodiversity you're influencing the

182
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,000
amount of terpenes that can be created

183
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,759
by a plant

184
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,360
so

185
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,800
just to get it

186
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,400
in something more simple that we can

187
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,360
just like relate to

188
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,079
um

189
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,759
lavender for instance is super high in

190
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:19,519
the terpene linalool and linalool is one

191
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,000
of those terpenes that is a plant to

192
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,719
plant communicator so when you plant

193
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,120
lavender around other plants they will

194
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,520
increase their linalool production

195
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,759
strawberries do the same thing

196
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:35,598
now certain terpenes though

197
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:38,560
communicate directly with microorganisms

198
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,680
and one of those is limonene

199
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,598
and so

200
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,598
you can have fungal

201
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,839
mycelial network those mycorrhizae

202
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,038
fungus that are down there in the root

203
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,119
zone

204
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,959
mutualistically helping the plant

205
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,720
already with phosphorus uptake and all

206
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,758
these other cool things

207
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,199
and

208
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,680
it will help produce limonene

209
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,800
if it knows that aphids are present

210
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,360
because increased in limonene will

211
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,759
ward off aphids so if you've ever grown

212
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,720
any plants that are super high in that

213
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,520
limonene i grew some lemon meringue last

214
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,759
year

215
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,240
and it was one of the only outdoor

216
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,199
plants that wasn't hit with aphids

217
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,759
because aphids do not like limonene

218
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,919
so it's just amazing that all of these

219
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,080
different terpenes while they are the

220
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,478
communication tool of plants they're

221
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:31,198
also helping us

222
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:34,000
they these terpenes are studied and

223
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,519
medicine known for reducing breast

224
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,360
cancer cells

225
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,479
helping alleviate

226
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,278
nausea from chemotherapy medication

227
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,440
and

228
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,799
all different kinds of things happen

229
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,880
because of terpenes and i just think

230
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,679
it's just so cool and what an

231
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,838
opportunity we have to explore them more

232
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:52,958
and talk about it and i don't know any

233
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,839
other

234
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:58,879
you know person who's as interested in

235
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,160
terpene as terpenes as cultivators yeah

236
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,278
so i mean a lot of people the the

237
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,679
medicinal plant that we know and love a

238
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:08,320
lot of people grow it for the terpenes

239
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:11,039
and uh it is super interesting that the

240
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,640
microbes in the medium have an impact on

241
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,719
it right a lot of people think it's just

242
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,879
the nutrients that you feed the plant

243
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,040
giving it the nutrition required and the

244
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,278
environment is gonna adjust you know the

245
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,519
phenotypical expression of it and that's

246
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,600
going to actually help with the terpenes

247
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,320
as far as development and so on and so

248
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,200
forth so what exactly like is there a

249
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,720
specific consortium of microbes that

250
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,600
will

251
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,120
you know

252
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,959
trigger certain terpenes to be developed

253
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,480
or like how does that work and like how

254
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,479
can the grower

255
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,440
control that or do they not have control

256
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,839
of that

257
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,800
um okay so this is the crazy thing is

258
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,200
that terpenes are influenced by stress

259
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,159
a lot of the times so

260
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,560
growing outside introduces a lot more

261
00:09:54,159 --> 00:10:01,360
diversity and stress when you are

262
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:04,399
outside you have heat and cold and

263
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,759
over watering or underwatering or

264
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,759
wind or more pests all of these things

265
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,200
increase terpene production

266
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,759
and so

267
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,800
it's a little bit more about like

268
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:19,360
you know losing control i guess

269
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,919
and allowing nature to run its course um

270
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,240
a lot of times we try to

271
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:27,360
manipulate and control all of these

272
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,680
aspects in our gardens and allowing

273
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,240
nature to do its thing and know that

274
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,559
plants can handle high temperatures

275
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,120
plants can handle a lot of different

276
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,958
stresses and in fact you're going to see

277
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,039
an increase in these terpene productions

278
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,719
if you kind of just

279
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,360
take a step back

280
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,959
and relax if you do want to increase

281
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,759
your terpene production and take an

282
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:52,958
active role i would suggest increasing

283
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,799
your biodiversity and all aspects of

284
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,159
things so that would be things like

285
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,799
cover cropping

286
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:01,360
and companion planting because terpenes

287
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,879
are influenced by root exudates which

288
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,680
give off sugars

289
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,679
so

290
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,838
you know you think about photosynthesis

291
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,159
and what is the byproduct that is sugar

292
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,920
and the sugar is exudated through the

293
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,759
roots calling in different

294
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:16,159
microorganisms

295
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,519
and in those root exudates are different

296
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,719
terpenes

297
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,120
and so

298
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,040
when you have different plants there you

299
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,278
have different terpenes and then you

300
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,519
have different microorganisms and then

301
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,120
you have an increase in production and

302
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,360
so really

303
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,200
i would suggest having a diversity in

304
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,480
your inputs so

305
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,759
instead of using synthetic nutrients

306
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,800
using organic from a wide variety of

307
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,200
sources

308
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:45,519
compost being

309
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,360
one of the best diversity of nutrients

310
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,360
you can get because think about all of

311
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,278
those different

312
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,240
inputs that are made you know that make

313
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:56,320
up compost it could be anything

314
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,000
and so when you want diversity we are

315
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,240
you are what you eat and you want

316
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,399
diversity in terpenes then you want

317
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,079
diversity in inputs you want to have as

318
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,320
much of that variety there so that you

319
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,879
can increase your terpene production

320
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,560
because most terpenes all start out with

321
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,240
the same precursor

322
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,319
and then they are synthesized into

323
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,799
individual and unique terpenes according

324
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,000
to what kind of

325
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:22,799
food or stress or microorganisms are

326
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,120
present so really trying to increase

327
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:28,799
that diversity through

328
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,519
your nutrient inputs through cover crop

329
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,159
and companion planting as well as

330
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,200
increasing your microbial diversity

331
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,000
and

332
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,759
like i said i'm i've been teaching these

333
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,480
um classes

334
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:45,278
like going hardcore teaching living soil

335
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,000
master classes across the country um

336
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:50,480
i've been to tampa florida last weekend

337
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,839
i was in chicago the month before

338
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,480
i was in

339
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,440
oklahoma city the month before that

340
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,879
and in every class i ask people to bring

341
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,360
soil samples

342
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,879
so we can look at their microbes under a

343
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,560
microscope

344
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,240
and predominantly

345
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:10,159
the samples that have the highest

346
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,440
diversity in microorganisms are those

347
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:15,360
that have

348
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,959
living native soil soil from outside in

349
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,959
there grows

350
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:21,278
so if you want to get diversity go

351
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:24,399
outside somewhere there's an established

352
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,958
ecosystem think old growth forest

353
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,440
somewhere that hasn't seen man destroy

354
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:32,559
it grab a scoop of soil

355
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,800
put that in an aerated compost soil tea

356
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,679
don't aerate too long because you want

357
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,120
diversity and put go ahead and spread

358
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,679
that in your garden and you're going to

359
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,919
see a huge increase in microbial

360
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,519
diversity which will then in turn

361
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,120
increase your terpenes

362
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,480
what you said about cover crops we'll

363
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,078
back up here for a minute what you said

364
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,360
about cover crops is pretty interesting

365
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:54,879
it's impact on terpene production can we

366
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,159
get deeper into cover crops a little bit

367
00:13:54,879 --> 00:14:00,320
because i myself have only used clover

368
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:04,078
and you know very popular cover crop to

369
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:07,040
use and you know you hit on diversity of

370
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:09,359
cover crops what else can be used for

371
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,639
cover crops that would be beneficial for

372
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,120
you know to have it

373
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,240
growing with medicinal plants

374
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,399
well

375
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,639
this is where holistic management comes

376
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,720
into play and holistically managing your

377
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,879
garden depending on what you need and

378
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,320
what you're looking for um so you have

379
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,480
to ask yourself like what are your

380
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,879
resources how much space you have

381
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,199
available how much time do you have to

382
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,879
put into this because all of those

383
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,879
answers are going to influence what i

384
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,078
would suggest for

385
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,399
cover crop

386
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:41,278
and some cover crops like buckwheat

387
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,919
which i use a lot outside grow really

388
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,799
quickly so you can harvest and cut it

389
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,719
down four times in a season if you don't

390
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,120
have the time or want to put in the

391
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,519
effort of cutting back your cover crop

392
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,440
constantly then maybe you want something

393
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,919
that's like a little bit more easy to

394
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,880
manage low growing maybe like a creeping

395
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:02,000
time which if you look at like

396
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:07,039
mammoth

397
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,320
peas canna troll like a lot of these um

398
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:13,519
pest controls are thyme oil so think

399
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,680
about look at what's in your ipm regimen

400
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,720
and all of these bottled ingredients and

401
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:20,159
if there's peppermint thyme

402
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,399
citronella

403
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,319
oregano stuff like that

404
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,679
those are great things to use as a cover

405
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,800
crop because it's going to be a pest

406
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,120
deterrent

407
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,519
also if you like to cook maybe you want

408
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,519
to incorporate some

409
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,600
plants that you would cook with there's

410
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,839
really no right or wrong answer it's

411
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:43,120
just depending on your certain situation

412
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,480
so for you what like what's what's your

413
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,078
garden like what do you want to

414
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,079
incorporate in there that's a good

415
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,958
question i know

416
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,719
you know i i want to retain water cover

417
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,879
crops are known for water retention i

418
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,079
live in in the desert very very dry

419
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,759
climate and the top of the medium dries

420
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,078
out super quickly so when i'm growing

421
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,399
with organic amendments for example when

422
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,799
i'm top dressing in worm castings or

423
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,399
compost or whatever that top layer is

424
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,159
drying out in this so the microbes are

425
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,839
going dormant so having a cover crop in

426
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,679
there is beneficial for me for water

427
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,440
retention purposes i also know that

428
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,359
clover in particular is good for

429
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,759
nitrogen fixation although i'm hearing

430
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,879
some mixed information in regards to it

431
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,199
some people say yeah it's great for

432
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,198
nitrogen fixation takes nitrogen from

433
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,120
the air puts into the form that the

434
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,198
plant can uptake down in the medium some

435
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,120
people said that bacteria needs to

436
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,719
actually do that transformation there

437
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,560
right and then some people say that

438
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,839
takes a long time for that process to

439
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,799
happen so you can actually complete your

440
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,120
entire grow of your medicinal plant and

441
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:44,719
you haven't had any benefit

442
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,679
is there any truth to that or what um so

443
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,720
clover is a legume in the legume family

444
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,799
and it's all legume species beans

445
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,199
peas clover

446
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,879
that have this ability to fix nitrogen

447
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:00,240
like you said from the atmosphere but

448
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:03,198
they do rely on a symbiotic relationship

449
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,240
with rhizobia a bacteria that will form

450
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:08,399
root nodules on the root zone

451
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,558
and they will pull the nitrogen out of

452
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,120
the atmosphere you do have to have those

453
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,879
nitrogen fixing bacteria present so if

454
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,119
you inoculate your seeds with this

455
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,600
bacteria you're good to go if you're

456
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,519
outside those bacteria are plentiful and

457
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,399
you don't need to inoculate they will

458
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,959
come

459
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,519
and a cool way to

460
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,720
know is just pull up an established

461
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,798
legume

462
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,839
and look at the roots and are there

463
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:35,839
little white nodules on those root hairs

464
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,759
and if they are then you have the

465
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:38,879
bacteria there and the nitrogen is being

466
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,759
fixed

467
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,520
it does take a while for that to happen

468
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:44,558
and so this is more of like

469
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,519
um

470
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:47,918
you know an

471
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,879
overwinter kind of a thing if you're

472
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,280
outside plant a legume or clover species

473
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,160
that is going to last all winter long

474
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:58,639
and then you can chop it down and let it

475
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,519
mix back in cover it with mulch compost

476
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,400
that kind of thing um

477
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:07,359
you do want to cut back your legumes

478
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,200
when they're about 50 percent into flour

479
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,719
once 50 percent of them have begun

480
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,038
flowering that's the time that you're

481
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,960
going to want to cut back any cover crop

482
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:17,440
and this is because they will start

483
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,640
pulling that nitrogen back out of the

484
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,080
soil and storing it in their seeds

485
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,679
once they start seed production you're

486
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,839
going to start losing the nitrogen that

487
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,559
you want to fix into your soil

488
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,119
so

489
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:30,879
i would suggest any kind of legume

490
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,759
nitrogen fixing cover crop to be

491
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,760
something that was put in place over

492
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:38,000
winter or while you're not cultivating

493
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:41,359
to really harness the benefits of it

494
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,919
um if you did want a fast

495
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:45,359
fixing nitrogen plant to grow while you

496
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,919
were cultivating

497
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:51,119
cow peas would be a great suggestion for

498
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,960
you in a hot climate with a lack of

499
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,839
water

500
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,000
so

501
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,759
that along with the buckwheat those are

502
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,759
two that do really well together and

503
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,839
buckwheat will pull phosphorus out of

504
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,599
the soil that is insoluble and turn it

505
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,319
into a soluble form

506
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,639
and there's so many amazing cover crops

507
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,639
though it's really like

508
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,960
you know play with it see how it does

509
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,280
for you try new things

510
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,038
now what about recommendations for like

511
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,279
i'm just a small indoor grower right i'm

512
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,679
usually in smaller containers

513
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:24,160
so jeopardy recommendations for like for

514
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,440
me as far as keeping a cover crop within

515
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,720
a small container whether it be a three

516
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,759
gallon five gallon seven gallon

517
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,519
something like that is there any

518
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,359
difference in kind of having cover crops

519
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,679
in smaller containers versus larger

520
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,918
containers or beds for example

521
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,400
yeah i mean with a smaller container

522
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,440
it's just not as much room for

523
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,400
error

524
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,679
and you have to keep re amending with

525
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,519
nutrients and so honestly for a smaller

526
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,880
container i would probably just go with

527
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:54,000
a mulch instead of trying to cover crop

528
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,559
and instead maybe take your

529
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,200
um practices of cover cropping outside

530
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:03,038
and try an outdoor garden i'm sure that

531
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,480
you have a yard hopefully um

532
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,240
and

533
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,839
not really actually the desert is like

534
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,839
really there's there's nothing there's

535
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,720
no yard back here at all now it's just

536
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,199
dirt

537
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,079
dang where are you located in las vegas

538
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,640
okay all right well

539
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:21,119
natives plants native species that's

540
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,880
always the go-to when you're in an area

541
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,479
that doesn't have a lot of water i would

542
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,240
always recommend a native species

543
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,679
because they evolved with the

544
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,919
environment there

545
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,840
um but for indoors i would really

546
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,559
recommend

547
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:38,879
cover crops on larger containers

548
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:40,639
i just got a grassroots fabric 4x8 bed

549
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,679
shout out grassroots thank you for

550
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,679
sending that to me for free um

551
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,320
and i'm going to be experimenting with

552
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,280
different cover crops inside

553
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:53,359
in a tent grow four by eight and so i'll

554
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:56,000
have more information for you on how

555
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:58,158
that works out inside i mean i'm just

556
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,159
transitioning from a five thousand

557
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:04,480
square foot canopy in a greenhouse

558
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:06,960
outside to a 4x8 tent inside so it's

559
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,440
going to be a huge scale down and really

560
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,919
applying things that home growers can

561
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,320
use a lot more easily than

562
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,840
if you had you know tons of room outside

563
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,839
to just throw seeds and plants

564
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,759
everywhere got it okay and then you

565
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:22,000
mentioned companion planting as well can

566
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:24,400
have an impact on terpenes can you talk

567
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,558
about that what companion plants would

568
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,000
you recommend and you know when would

569
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,000
you plant them as well i think that's

570
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,880
that's one thing i'd like to know yeah

571
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,200
so i would start them earlier um and

572
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,720
just companion planting for terpene

573
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,000
production is definitely something that

574
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,519
obviously you're going to want to grow

575
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,440
alongside your medicinal plants um so

576
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,519
strawberries are a great one

577
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,200
you can plant strawberries and they will

578
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,038
just keep on spreading the thing with

579
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,279
strawberries is that you're gonna want

580
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:52,240
to take the mother plant out

581
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,200
after

582
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,319
um a couple seasons so basically you'll

583
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,000
get a few um strawberry plants throw

584
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,839
them into your bed

585
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,079
and they will reproduce and send off

586
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,879
little rhizome shoots and that will have

587
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,960
a baby strawberry plant and so you will

588
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,320
continue getting fruit off of your main

589
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,720
strawberry your mother plant for two

590
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,399
three years but after that it really

591
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,000
slows down and you're going to want to

592
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,159
take those mother plants out and just

593
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,240
keep on cultivating the babies

594
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,400
and they spread like wildfire have you

595
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,640
ever grown strawberries yeah my mother

596
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,360
has up in new hampshire she has this and

597
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,799
they have spread like crazy it's uh it's

598
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:31,759
amazing you can sit there and harvest

599
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,079
them and then all of a sudden a day

600
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,158
later you can harvest more it's nuts

601
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,158
yeah it's amazing and so that's

602
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,320
something that's a great ground cover

603
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,640
cover crop companion plant and that will

604
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:45,200
increase linoleum production in your

605
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,360
other plants so that's an amazing

606
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,558
companion plant to go with um like i

607
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:52,959
mentioned earlier lavender as well

608
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:55,519
if you're outside and you have room

609
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,880
yarrow is one that you could do

610
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,400
um

611
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,159
i mean there's

612
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,640
really you can just play with it but

613
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,880
things that are really floral and sweet

614
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,480
smelling are going to be that lineal and

615
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,480
that will be

616
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,360
an increase in terpene production

617
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,839
um other companion plants

618
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:16,959
are great like pest deterrents like i

619
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:20,000
mentioned thyme or peppermint which mint

620
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,319
spreads like fire as well so be careful

621
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,720
about where you plant your mint because

622
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:27,599
it will take off and you think you put

623
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,440
it in a container and it finds a way to

624
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,558
climb out of that container

625
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,000
so

626
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,279
be careful

627
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,759
comfrey and borage are also excellent

628
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:41,678
companion plants and those are plants

629
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:43,839
also that you may want to plant

630
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,600
outside or only if you have a really

631
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,199
large container because they can get

632
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,918
quite large

633
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,919
the great thing about comfrey is that it

634
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:56,080
is like this bio accumulator um it

635
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,759
meaning that it pulls up a lot of the

636
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,599
nutrients that are in the soil really

637
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,759
readily and it stores them in their

638
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,959
leaves and it makes these huge beautiful

639
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:08,000
leaves that you can just chop and drop

640
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,480
right on your soil creating a free

641
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,119
nutrient a mulch

642
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,558
it's an excellent source of

643
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,038
minerals

644
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:19,440
a little bit of npk in there

645
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,759
so that would be something that

646
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,000
i could recommend as a companion plant

647
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,599
borage is related to comfrey it's a

648
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
little bit smaller

649
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:31,678
the bees love it if you're outside it's

650
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,119
an amazing pollinator attractant

651
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,200
but then you also need to be careful

652
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,359
about what pests you could be bringing

653
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,038
into your garden when you do companion

654
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:40,158
planting that's always something to be

655
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,240
aware of

656
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,679
so just think about like

657
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,400
you know

658
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,240
oh look at this beautiful butterfly well

659
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,320
what do butterflies do they lay eggs

660
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,640
that turn into caterpillars

661
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:55,119
what do caterpillars do they munch

662
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,200
through plants creating

663
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,879
trails for botrytis

664
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,120
so

665
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,880
you know it's a holistic approach of

666
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:06,239
looking when you are playing with other

667
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,640
species and creating your own ecosystem

668
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,558
uh you really want to just be aware and

669
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,960
try and educate yourself on what you're

670
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,759
doing or ask me send me a dm on

671
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,079
instagram i'll tell you

672
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:20,480
you mentioned chop and drop and i do

673
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:22,158
have a lot of new folks that tune into

674
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,839
this podcast can you explain exactly

675
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:28,400
what chop and drop is and how it's

676
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:30,720
beneficial yes so chop and drop is

677
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,679
pretty simple it is just chopping the

678
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:37,278
plant down and dropping it where it lays

679
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:39,840
and this is um the best example i can

680
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:42,960
give you is when you mow your lawn

681
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:45,038
do not put the bag on your lawnmower

682
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,759
that right there all of those grass

683
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:49,359
clippings are full of nitrogen

684
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,000
in fact 15

685
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:54,719
of the nitrogen your lawn requires can

686
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,278
come from your grass clippings reducing

687
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,440
your need for nitrogen fertilizer

688
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:00,960
and and if you allow your grass to grow

689
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,960
a little bit longer

690
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,400
you're gonna get more nitrogen when you

691
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,400
coat it

692
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,080
my neighbors are always

693
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,440
bothering me now that i live in a

694
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:11,278
neighborhood they're like oh when are

695
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,440
you going to mow your lawn

696
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,119
i'm like well

697
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,798
when i feel like it because that's

698
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,319
nitrogen that's free nitrogen right

699
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,798
there i'm waiting for it to get to that

700
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,319
height before i chop and drop and just

701
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:23,519
to clarify you said you know chop the

702
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:25,439
plant down put it there you're talking

703
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,038
about like the cover crop for example or

704
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,960
you could even take like the leaves off

705
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,879
of like some people defoliation

706
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,640
technique off of their plant they can

707
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,360
just drop those leaves right down onto

708
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,200
the surface right exactly right there

709
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,199
when you're defoliating you can just

710
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,720
leave the leaves

711
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,519
unless you have a pest problem obviously

712
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,759
but

713
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,480
allowing it to just break down in your

714
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:51,200
soil surface is just going to add back

715
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,038
the nitrogen you think of nitrogen with

716
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,880
green growth

717
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,038
when we talked about composting in our

718
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,799
last episode we talked about the

719
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:00,558
different inputs that you need for

720
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,960
composting and that's nitrogen and

721
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:06,000
carbon and so whenever there is green

722
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,240
left in a plant that's nitrogen present

723
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,679
and so when you allow your plant matter

724
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,558
to decay

725
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,278
on the surface it is going to

726
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:18,639
feed your soil and then your plants with

727
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:22,000
nitrogen bacteria love

728
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,399
organic fresh organic matter like leaf

729
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,759
litter so bacteria are going to come up

730
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:28,239
and they're going to feed off of that

731
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:31,759
nitrogen source and once the green is

732
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,399
gone it becomes brown and that's carbon

733
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:36,079
and then the carbon feeds the fungus

734
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:37,278
it's amazing it's a full circle of life

735
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,960
there

736
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:41,038
i was going to ask if anything is lost

737
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,720
when you lay that down on top and it

738
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,240
starts to brown up i was going to ask

739
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,360
you if you're losing the nitrogen or not

740
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,399
but you're saying the bacteria is

741
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:50,000
basically coming up to the leaf

742
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,479
taking all the nitrogen and bringing it

743
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,720
down into the medium yep exactly and

744
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,880
nitrogen is a mobile nutrient meaning it

745
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,839
moves with water so

746
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,880
when you have any runoff and there's

747
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:05,759
green leaf matter there

748
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,799
or any nitrogen that is mobile in your

749
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:12,558
soil you are seeing that nitrogen leave

750
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:15,200
and run out of your pot um so really

751
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:17,119
with the whole living soil

752
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,798
system you don't really want a ton of

753
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,519
runoff

754
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:22,480
anytime you have runoff mobile nutrients

755
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,519
are

756
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,720
attaching to hydrogen molecules in the

757
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:31,599
water and leaving your container and

758
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:35,120
that is why in the united states we see

759
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:37,199
a lot of eutrophication in our waterways

760
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:39,519
and that is a buildup or excess of

761
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,558
nitrogen and phosphorus and that can be

762
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:45,359
detrimental to water ecosystems yeah

763
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,798
toxic algae blooms right so that's uh

764
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,278
this is terrible terrible for the

765
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,960
environment yep i do want to back up a

766
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:53,038
little bit when you you you kind of

767
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,960
touched upon this is like stressing the

768
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,480
plant is gonna help with terpene

769
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,360
production and it's funny i just

770
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,240
released a video not too long ago

771
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:04,240
where it was fill my garden inside in my

772
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,399
grow temp and i pointed out that the

773
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,240
plant that was right next to the fan

774
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,239
seemed to have

775
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,679
more trichome production than the other

776
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,519
plants that were further away from the

777
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,159
plant i'm not further away from the fan

778
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:19,038
sorry and uh that is a form of stress

779
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,960
right wind stress is a form of stress

780
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,960
that can certainly help increase

781
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,880
trichome production within the trichomes

782
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,960
of the terpenes cannabinoids so on and

783
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:31,200
so forth what other forms of stress can

784
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,120
you get into that will really help with

785
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,720
terpene production

786
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,479
yeah um

787
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,440
heat stress

788
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,839
will definitely be one of them

789
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,240
that actually is also known to increase

790
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:46,079
thc content um the higher the

791
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,880
temperatures there's a lot of studies

792
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:51,439
done in israel that are

793
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,039
taking this data and showing different

794
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,360
the same exact clone strain everything

795
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:59,599
and putting it through heat stress and

796
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:02,079
they're seeing higher levels of terpenes

797
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:04,398
and higher levels of thc in there

798
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,519
it is kind of like a

799
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:07,038
um

800
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:10,158
sunblock the plant creates its own

801
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:13,119
sunblock by increasing those um trichome

802
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:16,399
heads to protect it from uv radiation

803
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:17,599
how are they like from my understanding

804
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,678
you mentioned this at the beginning of

805
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:21,278
the episode terpenes volatiles right so

806
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,320
that what that's what you're smelling

807
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,640
now when you're increasing the

808
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:26,158
temperature are you at risk of losing

809
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,000
some of those terpenes because they're

810
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,399
volatizing off the plant are you doing

811
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,359
the heat stress for a short period of

812
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:33,439
time

813
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:35,199
so it doesn't so you don't aren't losing

814
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,159
terpenes or what

815
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,558
um when your plant is alive and it's

816
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,440
creating terpenes um you don't really

817
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:46,158
need to worry about losing them to

818
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,080
oxidation like you would if it was cut

819
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,840
you don't want to introduce heat stress

820
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:54,000
to a like when you're drying your plant

821
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:56,879
terpenes are volatile that they will

822
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,278
combust above 69 degrees

823
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,960
um there are terpenes that that is

824
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:03,839
like that is as high as they can get

825
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,278
before they burn off but when you have a

826
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,158
plant that is alive and it's

827
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:10,319
synthesizing terpenes constantly um

828
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,399
you're not going to see

829
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,398
those terpenes gone forever the plant is

830
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:16,398
actively responding to nature its

831
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:18,798
physiology is changing according to

832
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:22,000
what's happening to it it's

833
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:24,240
living breathing like you and me um and

834
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
think about you know like maybe when

835
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,558
you're hot and you're running and you

836
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,278
sweat your sweat's kind of stinky

837
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,678
that's like a terpene

838
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:35,599
kind of in a way just to think about so

839
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,440
basically you're you're generating more

840
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,839
terpenes that you're losing is kind of

841
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,159
what you're getting at yeah yeah exactly

842
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,278
gotcha and then i guess storage is

843
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,840
another thing we were talking about

844
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:47,278
conserving the terpenes on the storage i

845
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,759
think a lot of people make the mistake

846
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:52,159
of not having the proper temperature and

847
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:54,640
humidity as far for storage i think a

848
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,840
lot of people aim after that you know 62

849
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,759
percent some people say 58

850
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:00,879
relative humidity within the actual

851
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:02,640
container but a lot of people are

852
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,278
ignoring the actual temperature that the

853
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,000
storing is so i mean right now it's high

854
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:10,319
70s low 80s just to my house if i were

855
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,599
to have flour right here

856
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:13,200
arguably i'm losing some of those

857
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,359
terpenes right so is there like a

858
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,600
certain temperature that you stick

859
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,879
towards for storage oh yeah i definitely

860
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:23,839
try and keep it under 69 degrees um in a

861
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,200
cool dark place a great location is the

862
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,278
bathroom

863
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,600
in your closet in a dark closet that's

864
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,798
typically where i will store it because

865
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,959
you're going to have that constant

866
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:34,798
humidity from showering in there and

867
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,880
keeping it back up

868
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:40,079
bringing that rh that relative humidity

869
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,480
back to a 50 60 it'll boost up to 90

870
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:44,798
percent when the door is closed with the

871
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,038
water running in the shower but it

872
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,960
dissipates down and depending where you

873
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:50,798
live living obviously this would

874
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,759
influence whether or not you keep it in

875
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:56,879
the bathroom if you live in a place like

876
00:32:53,759 --> 00:33:00,398
florida or oklahoma where

877
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,080
the outside is already 85 humidity you

878
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:04,639
don't really need to introduce more

879
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:06,960
humidity in that form but where you're

880
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,080
at in las vegas or where i'm at in

881
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,519
washington

882
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:12,000
idaho

883
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,798
um it can be a lot drier and you might

884
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,079
want to reintroduce those that humidity

885
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:17,278
but really trying to keep the

886
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,798
temperature

887
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:23,599
between 60 and 70 degrees is ideal

888
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,759
anytime you go over 68 degrees you're

889
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,678
starting to lose terpenes what about

890
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:30,398
storing in like your refrigerator which

891
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,320
is lower than 60 degrees or even some

892
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:34,479
people put in the freezer is there any

893
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:35,439
harm being done with that

894
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,558
um

895
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,120
well

896
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:42,639
i have a funny story about that um so

897
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:45,759
a few years ago

898
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:49,440
um when i was licensed in california

899
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:53,599
i had done an entire indoor grow it was

900
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:55,120
probably like 30 pounds of flour

901
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:56,879
that was

902
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:57,678
frozen

903
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,480
for

904
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,640
uh

905
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,079
concentrate production i was going to be

906
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,960
taking it to a lab and they were going

907
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:07,839
to turn it into a bho product

908
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,840
and

909
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:14,559
i decided well me and my partner decided

910
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,480
to end our business relationship

911
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:17,358
and we needed to

912
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,440
um

913
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:21,918
sell all of our product and liquidate

914
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,000
assets and so i thought well we're not

915
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,158
going to take this to the lab and go

916
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,239
through the processing i'm just going to

917
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,919
open up this bag this vacuum sealed bag

918
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,118
that's been in the freezer for a few

919
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:35,279
months and see what the flour is like

920
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,358
and um

921
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,480
it was kind of like you know those

922
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:43,519
little peanuts from like packing and

923
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,519
packaging like little styrofoam peanuts

924
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:46,480
that's how it felt

925
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:48,960
um

926
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,000
it had lost a lot of

927
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,199
moisture and it was really like

928
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,878
dry

929
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,960
and

930
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:58,799
weird texture

931
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,599
it still smelled great

932
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,800
but

933
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,720
the moisture level was very strange from

934
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,519
being in the freezer

935
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:09,598
and i don't know if that's because

936
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:11,039
the moisture gets pulled out into ice

937
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,720
and you like condensate and that's why

938
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:14,079
you start seeing like freezer burn on

939
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:17,919
things like that because whatever

940
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,440
moisture is in there gets pulled out

941
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,559
so i would

942
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,039
digress and do not put it in the freezer

943
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:27,119
if you have an other option

944
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:30,800
the refrigerator

945
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,519
tends to be super humid and

946
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,359
smelly is weird and i don't know if i

947
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,759
would put them maybe if you had a

948
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:39,838
refrigerator that was specifically for

949
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,280
flour

950
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:43,838
but really

951
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,000
keeping it at below 70 degrees most of

952
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:49,199
us have air conditioning and have our

953
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,838
houses at 70 degrees that's your best

954
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:52,559
bet somewhere dark

955
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:54,639
and

956
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:56,880
having a good cure is really going to

957
00:35:54,639 --> 00:36:00,719
preserve your terpenes because when you

958
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:03,519
don't cure it properly and maybe you um

959
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:06,799
don't burp it allow let out the off

960
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:10,159
gassing opening it up and even opening

961
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,160
it up in brings in carbon dioxide from

962
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:14,960
our breath which can influence the

963
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:17,118
curing process all of these things

964
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,920
influence how the terpenes are going to

965
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,000
be preserved so

966
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,880
getting to that point storing it in your

967
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,920
home

968
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,358
at a nice like if it's 72 i mean it's

969
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,400
not really you're not going to lose a

970
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:30,480
ton of them

971
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,639
i wouldn't stress too much about it i

972
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,039
would be more worried about putting it

973
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,719
in the refrigerator or the freezer than

974
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,719
a 72 degree house

975
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:40,799
i actually have put it into a wine

976
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:43,039
fridge set to 60 degrees

977
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,160
oh perfect so yeah it seems like it's

978
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:45,440
working pretty good so far i've been

979
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:47,519
using it for about six months or

980
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,200
something like that and uh

981
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:50,880
yeah i mean i have it in glass jars

982
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:53,759
which obviously you know getting the

983
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,760
temperature into the glass jar to be the

984
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,000
same there's a slow process there but

985
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,320
then those grove bags i'm also using

986
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,400
those as well now and put them into the

987
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,400
fridge but it seems like it's working to

988
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,920
conserve them for a longer period of

989
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,559
time you know

990
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,519
yeah and a wine fridge is different than

991
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,400
like a regular food fridge so i would

992
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:14,719
say

993
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,639
wine is all about temperature and

994
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:18,719
preserving terpenes and flavor in that

995
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:20,319
bottle and not allowing it to oxidize so

996
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:22,879
that's a great option i didn't even

997
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,559
think about wine fridges so that's

998
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,599
pretty cool you gotta have those are

999
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:28,960
kind of expensive though so true yeah

1000
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,480
spending a lot of money on those i

1001
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,760
actually got a gifted to me i was lucky

1002
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,719
enough somebody was throwing them away

1003
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,040
so i was like yeah i'll take it sure

1004
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:41,919
there you go your wine fridge turned in

1005
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:43,199
your plant medicine fridge right exactly

1006
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,039
so what else do we need to know about

1007
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:46,960
terpenes did you want to go over like

1008
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:50,159
some of the different terpenes and how

1009
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,159
they affect us or what other things with

1010
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,440
terpenes did you kind of want to cover

1011
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:55,440
on this episode

1012
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,358
i mean

1013
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,200
all of the terpenes all terpenes are

1014
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:01,838
good for you right they all have

1015
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:03,118
different properties um

1016
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:04,400
really

1017
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,079
it's just

1018
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,838
the fact that

1019
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,440
terpenes

1020
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:14,639
play this important role in plant

1021
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,920
communication through plant insect plant

1022
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:18,799
pathogen

1023
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,760
plant to plant interaction i have been

1024
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,000
doing some research and it's pretty cool

1025
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,280
when you have the like we talked about

1026
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,440
companion planting one study um

1027
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,119
showed that cyanide was released by

1028
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,320
cassava plants

1029
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:37,519
that were planted next to peanut plants

1030
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,280
and this caused the peanut roots to

1031
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:42,719
release ethylene

1032
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,960
which is a plant growth hormone

1033
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:48,159
and it altered the rhizosphere and

1034
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,358
increased the actinobacteria

1035
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,159
and so

1036
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:55,119
it's just amazing how plants can use

1037
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:57,199
terpenes we just we just don't give them

1038
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,079
enough credit i don't think and that's

1039
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:02,960
really when i wanna you know hit home

1040
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,880
here is that yes we love terpenes

1041
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,920
because of the way they smell

1042
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,079
but

1043
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,960
what they do for plants and how they can

1044
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:14,320
call in bacteria how certain plants can

1045
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,119
put off scents to ward off insects or

1046
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,039
how

1047
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:21,358
a plant can communicate with fungus with

1048
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:23,358
mycorrhizal fungus and by releasing a

1049
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:25,920
certain terpene

1050
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:28,639
and telling that fungus hey we're

1051
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,760
stressed out we don't have enough water

1052
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:31,279
and you know what

1053
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,200
that fungus can do

1054
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,000
it can communicate to

1055
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:39,199
any plant that is within its mycelial

1056
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,719
network and let it know hey man

1057
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,039
maybe there's a tree on the other side

1058
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:45,759
of the forest that that fungus is tapped

1059
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:47,838
into and it can say well this tree over

1060
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,079
here on the other side of the forest

1061
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:51,519
is starting to dry out and you know what

1062
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,440
happens when they dry out the bark

1063
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:56,639
beetles come so

1064
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,599
you guys over there let's increase our

1065
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:01,440
turpentine which is actually where the

1066
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,359
word terpene comes from

1067
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,838
is turpentine which is the specific

1068
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:08,318
terpene that's found in pine trees

1069
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:11,279
so this is true like the mycorrhizal

1070
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:12,719
fungus will go ahead and it will

1071
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,599
hear

1072
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:17,598
here i mean i'm saying here but what i'm

1073
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,359
meaning is it it just is listening to

1074
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,280
the trees terpenes

1075
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:22,480
and it can sense this and it can say

1076
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,760
okay

1077
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,838
i'm dried out this tree's dried out

1078
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,440
i'm gonna communicate down to the tree

1079
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:30,239
on the other side of the forest and tell

1080
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,800
it

1081
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,799
hey the drought's coming that means bark

1082
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,800
beetles are coming increase your

1083
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,599
terpentine and that is gonna ward off

1084
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:43,599
the beetles it's just amazing and i

1085
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,119
really really hope that everyone

1086
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,440
will just give terpenes a little bit

1087
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,559
more credit and in turn they will

1088
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,679
support their sun-grown cultivators who

1089
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:53,920
are

1090
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:57,039
allowing their plants to live their most

1091
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,119
plant life with the most biodiversity

1092
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,480
and the most terpenes and that is why

1093
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,559
sun grown

1094
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,519
is superior to indoor i'm sorry you're

1095
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:06,519
an indoor grower but

1096
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:11,039
it's all right no you mentioned uh

1097
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,800
it's super interesting with with fungi

1098
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,119
and microrizal fungi how that works with

1099
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,800
the whole system underground and so on

1100
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,640
and so forth i watched the documentary

1101
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,720
fantastic fungi i don't know if you've

1102
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,960
seen that one or not but incredible

1103
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,559
documentary it talks a lot about that

1104
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,159
the mycelium network that's under the

1105
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:28,559
ground and all that stuff but that kind

1106
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:30,879
of leads into what i want to talk about

1107
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:32,239
next which is something i saw on your

1108
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,519
youtube channel which i just realized

1109
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,199
you have a youtube channel i didn't know

1110
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:36,800
you had one and it's a video that you

1111
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,799
just recently put out that relates to

1112
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,000
what we're talking about which is the

1113
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,480
bacteria to fungi ratio

1114
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,318
in the actual medium and like you

1115
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,800
mentioned they do have an impact on

1116
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:50,559
terpenes and i didn't know there were

1117
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,640
test kits out there so on your video you

1118
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:54,239
actually have a test kit that you got

1119
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:55,920
you're able to take a sample and you're

1120
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:58,399
actually able to find out the fungal to

1121
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,720
bacteria ratio can you talk about that

1122
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,559
yeah so that is a microbiometer and that

1123
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:06,078
was my first time using it um super cool

1124
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:09,960
nifty tool

1125
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:13,920
it is very influenced by

1126
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:16,800
microorganisms and microbial products so

1127
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,119
i have heard that you should i mean and

1128
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,760
this should be kind of common sense but

1129
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:25,519
don't buy it and test your

1130
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,520
amendment or your soil or your medium

1131
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:29,679
right after you've applied a microbial

1132
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:31,759
product because it's going to skew the

1133
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:34,719
test results and you may be like oh wow

1134
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,480
i have such high percentage of microbial

1135
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,399
biomass

1136
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,280
so really it's a good

1137
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,160
baseline test kit so you can test your

1138
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,079
medium um

1139
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:48,239
at the end of the cycle or the beginning

1140
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,720
of the cycle not right when you have

1141
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:53,759
applied any microbial product

1142
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:56,399
so in this case we went ahead and took a

1143
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:00,640
soil sample you can see it in the video

1144
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:03,119
right outside in um one of my

1145
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:05,358
patreons gardens which is so cool

1146
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,960
patreon has connected me to actual

1147
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:08,480
people where i get to go and help them

1148
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,800
on their farm and

1149
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,119
make real friends that are like my best

1150
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,800
friends for life now

1151
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,760
so patreon.com queen of the sun grown yo

1152
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,519
um

1153
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,119
but we went ahead and we took this

1154
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,599
microbiometer

1155
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,400
took a sample and

1156
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,720
you put it in the test tube shake it up

1157
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,559
with a little bit of i don't know they

1158
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:33,039
give you a little packet of powder that

1159
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:34,960
you put in with the water and

1160
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:37,119
you shake it let it sit for 20 minutes

1161
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,760
and you put it on this slide

1162
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,000
and you take a picture with your phone

1163
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,319
it's so mind-blowing i don't understand

1164
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,039
technology i don't get it

1165
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:48,880
i don't understand how a phone

1166
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:51,519
can take a picture

1167
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:55,599
of a little test slide with

1168
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:58,318
the soil sample the water and the powder

1169
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:01,039
chemical powder and analyze

1170
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:02,880
the microbial biomass that is present in

1171
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:04,800
that sample

1172
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,280
it's mind-blowing to me what can't

1173
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,400
phones do really

1174
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,920
that's wild so micro biometer

1175
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,639
how much those things cost and where can

1176
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:19,519
people get those um microbiometer.com

1177
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:23,519
and they cost i believe 135 to 150

1178
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:24,239
and it comes with a ton of test testers

1179
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:26,239
so

1180
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:27,838
it should last you like

1181
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,199
many many many cycles i think there's

1182
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:30,559
like 20

1183
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,679
um

1184
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:34,159
test

1185
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:37,519
tube things in there that you can test

1186
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:40,480
20 tests or something like that

1187
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:43,519
but besides the microbial biomass it

1188
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,358
also gives you your bacteria to fungi

1189
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:46,400
ratio

1190
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:47,598
and so

1191
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,838
um

1192
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,838
there's a lot of debate about

1193
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,280
plant

1194
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,240
the medicinal plant in question

1195
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,560
um

1196
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:01,039
and it's being fungally dominant

1197
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:02,078
preferring a fungally dominant um

1198
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:05,838
medium

1199
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:09,039
and so like i haven't seen scientific

1200
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:11,679
evidence that suggests that it needs to

1201
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:13,679
be fungally dominant um

1202
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:16,399
when you think of

1203
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:19,358
what associates with fungus

1204
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,599
um what plants need it it's

1205
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:25,679
plants that live a really really long

1206
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:27,599
time like trees because fungus is a very

1207
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:28,879
slow growing

1208
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,000
um

1209
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,318
organism

1210
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,599
whereas bacteria is like this boom and

1211
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:36,159
bust

1212
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:40,880
so when you see a disturbance in an

1213
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:43,199
ecosystem such as a fire or a road grade

1214
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,640
being cut out um

1215
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,960
any kind of disturbance to that

1216
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:49,358
ecosystem that has destroyed and taken

1217
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,119
away the plants you're going to start

1218
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:54,159
seeing

1219
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,960
an increase in bacteria really quickly

1220
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:59,838
they're the first species to come in

1221
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,159
and they're associated with grasses and

1222
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:04,400
herbaceous plants that are fast-growing

1223
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,000
that's why you'll see the legumes at

1224
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,880
road cuts like

1225
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,639
lupine or hairy vetch growing along

1226
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,079
borders of fences because there's been a

1227
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:13,440
disturbance there

1228
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,800
and then when you start looking for

1229
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,679
fungus

1230
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,680
it's in older developed ecosystems where

1231
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:21,440
there's old-growth trees

1232
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:23,838
and that's why we

1233
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,760
as gardeners and farmers

1234
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:27,838
practice no-till

1235
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,160
because any time you till you're

1236
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:33,039
disturbing the ecosystem and you are

1237
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:36,318
pushing it toward a bacterial dominance

1238
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:39,440
now with the plant in question i would

1239
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:43,119
say that having a good balance of both

1240
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:46,880
is more important than trying to

1241
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:49,358
assert dominance by fungus over bacteria

1242
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,280
the only reason i can see

1243
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:54,239
that you would want more fungal

1244
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:57,920
dominance over bacterial is that

1245
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:59,039
bacterial slime raises your ph

1246
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,639
and

1247
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:04,880
this plant likes a slightly irricatious

1248
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:07,759
or acidic soil

1249
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:13,680
similar to azaleas or blueberries

1250
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:17,920
um between a 5.8 and a 6.2 and so fungus

1251
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:19,919
grows in a slightly acidic soil

1252
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,680
and that would be my only deduction of

1253
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,599
why you may want

1254
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:26,159
slightly more fungus is to help with the

1255
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,079
ph balance of your medium got it yeah i

1256
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,318
know there's a lot of controversy behind

1257
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:32,559
the medicinal plant whether or not it is

1258
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:34,558
fungal dominant or bacteria dominant

1259
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:37,519
which one the plant prefers

1260
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:40,000
so if they get the test results and they

1261
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:41,679
find out they're dominant one way or the

1262
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,960
other

1263
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:45,118
what do you recommend would you would

1264
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,199
they just find a microbial inoculant

1265
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,200
that kind of leans towards the way that

1266
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,318
they're trying to go

1267
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,719
i wouldn't

1268
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:55,920
recommend any products because i am not

1269
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:58,558
a product person i would recommend um

1270
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,880
creating the environment or habitat that

1271
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:04,079
is best suited for the organism that you

1272
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,318
are looking for so with fungus

1273
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:09,200
we would if you would like to see an

1274
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:11,039
increase in your your fungal population

1275
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:14,159
you're going to want to provide the

1276
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:17,599
fungus with food which is

1277
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:21,039
uh complex carbohydrates fungus love

1278
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,400
grains straw mulch those kinds of things

1279
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:25,440
so you're going to want to cover your

1280
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,960
soil surface with a mulch

1281
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:31,119
whether it's

1282
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,960
straw or rice holes or bark

1283
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,760
something like that that is where you're

1284
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,559
going to see an increase in water

1285
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,400
retention because fungus also really

1286
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,319
likes moisture think about where they

1287
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,800
grow in the pnw

1288
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:47,679
pacific northwest

1289
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,000
places that see a lot of rain and so

1290
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:52,480
increasing your soil moisture

1291
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,519
is going to help influence that fungal

1292
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,318
dominance or fungal ratio

1293
00:48:55,519 --> 00:49:02,719
if you want to see more bacteria

1294
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:04,159
then feed your soil simple carbohydrates

1295
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,919
such as

1296
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:07,199
yucca

1297
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,079
molasses

1298
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:13,118
brown sugar brown cane sugar

1299
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:15,200
basically bacteria love sugar and so if

1300
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:18,079
you can increase the diversity of the

1301
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:19,439
sugars either by introducing them

1302
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,318
through a tea

1303
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,639
or like we talked about root exudates of

1304
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:27,440
different species of plants

1305
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:29,199
specifically legumes and things of that

1306
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,800
nature then you will increase your

1307
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:32,879
bacterial

1308
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,839
ratio but

1309
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:38,480
just inoculating isn't going sure you're

1310
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:40,719
going to have a bunch for a week

1311
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,000
or a day

1312
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:44,399
but

1313
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,960
is it going to germinate is it going to

1314
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,920
thrive so many soil samples that i've

1315
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:52,800
looked at under a microscope have tons

1316
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,720
of fungal spores but the spores haven't

1317
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,160
germinated the spores are still closed

1318
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:58,959
they're not growing

1319
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:01,838
and so why is that well they don't have

1320
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:04,000
mulch they don't have enough water they

1321
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:06,880
don't have the right environment so

1322
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,559
really if you want to see more fungus or

1323
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,400
more bacteria

1324
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,720
you're going to want to

1325
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:15,039
give them the habitat that they want to

1326
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:16,480
live in i love it really really great

1327
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:17,759
information you know you really are an

1328
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,079
inspiration when it comes to the whole

1329
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,319
regenerative gardening side of things

1330
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,680
and uh you know hats off to you for for

1331
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:25,759
doing what you do as far as your

1332
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:27,440
movement with the classes and and so on

1333
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,040
and so forth we are getting towards the

1334
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,800
end of the episode here and there's one

1335
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:32,800
question i'd like to ask towards the end

1336
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,920
of almost every episode

1337
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,440
like i mentioned we have a lot of

1338
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,440
beginners that are tuned into this

1339
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,519
podcast and i like to ask the guest what

1340
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:42,000
advice do you have for beginners make

1341
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:44,880
observations pay attention

1342
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,199
really write things down have a journal

1343
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,240
or a calendar and any time you do

1344
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:50,719
anything

1345
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:51,759
just write it down the date that you did

1346
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:53,679
it

1347
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,720
and then take a look at your plant every

1348
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:56,239
day

1349
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:57,358
and just be like oh

1350
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:59,279
you know

1351
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:01,440
the leaves the edges of my leaves look a

1352
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,200
little serrated today

1353
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,679
what could that mean maybe it's a little

1354
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:07,519
stressed or perhaps there's a little bit

1355
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:09,199
of a canoeing or taco wing where it's

1356
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:12,559
bending in at that

1357
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:15,759
marginal vein right in the center

1358
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:18,160
just make observations write it down and

1359
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,480
then if you start having any problems

1360
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:23,039
you can go back and look at your notes

1361
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,199
and you can deduce right away

1362
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:27,358
or you can have the information ready to

1363
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:29,759
ask somebody who might know better

1364
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:31,759
awesome yeah good advice there so

1365
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,520

1366
