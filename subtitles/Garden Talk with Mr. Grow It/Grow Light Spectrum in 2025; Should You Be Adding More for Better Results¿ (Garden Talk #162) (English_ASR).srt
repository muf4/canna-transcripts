lighting this is something that has

75
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:53,239
changed so much over the years and now

76
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,400
we're in a New Year 2025 and I can't

77
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,039
wait to pick your brain on things to

78
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,200
kind of look for in a grow light we're

79
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,000
going to be getting into so many

80
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,399
different topics that relate to life Li

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,120
in you mentioned to me that you've been

82
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,640
doing a lot of research on it so I'm

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,599
eager to hear kind of some of the things

84
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,479
that you found out well the thing about

85
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:10,158
it is is that this is the you know it's

86
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,518
a plant it it grow this thing has been

87
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,039
growing for you know hundreds of

88
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,799
thousands millions of years like there's

89
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,280
not a ton of new science that comes out

90
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,200
week to week as far as like the actual

91
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,400
like oh we found out there's a new

92
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:25,318
nutrient riboflavin you know it needs

93
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,599
more riboflavin and so you know it's one

94
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:27,958
of those things like how do you how do

95
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:29,798
you keep up with what's going on out

96
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,719
there and one of the things that changes

97
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,519
week to week is not only the technology

98
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,959
of lighting obviously with all all the

99
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:38,080
different Tech that comes out but also

100
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,319
the science of it it's one of the least

101
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,239
understood aspects of uh lighting and so

102
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:43,560
when we were talking about what we

103
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,799
wanted to talk about it's like oh I'm

104
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,640
I'm super hyped on not just the lighting

105
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:51,040
and the technology but the interaction

106
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:52,798
your ppfs your DLI uh how these

107
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:56,239
different lighting Cycles affect what

108
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,760
the plant does how it produces biomass

109
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,519
versus the the voc's the volatile

110
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,120
organic compounds that we all like to

111
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,920
consume and uh yeah that's pretty much

112
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,759
been my uh my obsession over the last

113
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,518
little bit so I stoked to get to talk

114
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,239
about it with you that's awesome well

115
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,680
before we get too deep into lighting can

116
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,079
we do an introduction tell us a little

117
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,000
bit about yourself and kind of how you

118
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,680
got into gardening of course so uh as

119
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,279
some of you may know my name is Josh

120
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,240
grambo I'm a comedian here in Denver

121
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,198
Colorado I've been touring the country

122
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,160
for the last couple years and then uh

123
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:31,400
I've been a a you know a consumer my

124
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,080
whole life my entire literally my entire

125
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:34,918
not even my adult life even going into

126
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:37,680
my adolescent life and it's always

127
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,000
provided for me every turn every turn I

128
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,759
go it just seemed like when I was in

129
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,600
high school and I did I didn't know

130
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,520
where my friend group was it's like oh I

131
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,720
found these super cool guys that are all

132
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:47,279
enjoyed the same sort of stuff

133
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,880
skateboarding and hanging out and all

134
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,279
that stuff and the plants are right

135
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,038
there as part of the lifestyle and then

136
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,079
I need to get out of Iowa where I'm born

137
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:57,360
I'm from the band slip knots hometown of

138
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:00,079
De Moine Iowa and so I got to watch

139
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,960
those guys flower and leave EV they

140
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,839
still have houses there but it was very

141
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,198
uh you know inspiring to watch these

142
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:09,119
guys that I was a a freshman to their

143
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,879
senior so I always say I know them but

144
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,120
they don't know me sort of thing but I

145
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,839
got to watch them go from De Moine and

146
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,959
step up to the big leagues and I learned

147
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:19,638
that if you put in work you can actually

148
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:22,038
do things in this world and that led me

149
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,918
to getting out of De Moine I was a

150
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:26,918
refugee essentially I left uh De Moine

151
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:29,240
so I could go to Colorado and you know

152
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:31,879
start a family and be safe and work you

153
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,560
know I never fortunately never had any

154
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:36,759
serious interaction with the officials

155
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,000
out in the world so I was able to get

156
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,840
away scot-free out of a Prohibition land

157
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,160
as we call it and uh yeah and then when

158
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,599
I got to call around it's very very

159
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,199
expensive here it's very hard to get

160
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,280
around and once again the plants

161
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:52,199
provided away in again then as the

162
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:53,918
bottom started falling out of the market

163
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,240
and everything started kind of changing

164
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,198
and going the way of uh you know what is

165
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,400
happening now that the the butterfly

166
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:04,520
cocoon into corporate world that we're

167
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:06,719
going into it it just wasn't that uh the

168
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:09,240
profit incentive will say to do it the

169
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,919
way I had always been doing it and so I

170
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,079
stepped away and I was like let me start

171
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,159
doing comedy and I I went and I did I

172
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,000
did it I I didn't do it like at the

173
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,840
arena level but I you know I started

174
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,680
grinding my way up takes years and years

175
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:25,439
of grinding that and after a big road

176
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,400
trip I did a 5we tour all across America

177
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,279
started in Florida ended in Utah

178
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:32,799
zigzagged from from Maine to you know

179
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:36,399
Tennessee Iowa Minnesota every you know

180
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,800
I think we did 28 States and 35 nights

181
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,399
had the most fun of my entire life and

182
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,759
we made good money on the trip and I

183
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:45,638
came home $300 in the negative and I was

184
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,199
like man when I get back to Denver I got

185
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,439
to figure out like something that can

186
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,560
like be my my uh you know supplement

187
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:55,478
like the real thing that I I I can do to

188
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,478
make money and kind of provide you know

189
00:06:55,478 --> 00:06:59,839
going room to room playing to 50 people

190
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:02,719
that's fun but uh actually like being

191
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:06,000
able to start a community of my own and

192
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,560
just so happens the week that I got back

193
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,759
uh the dude grow show which i' had been

194
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,000
a big fan of uh lost their producer and

195
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,919
I had over uh the lockdown and

196
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,918
everything when standup got taken away I

197
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:19,159
kind of gave myself a mini film school

198
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:20,839
education and on the outside of that I

199
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,120
didn't know why I didn't know what I was

200
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:25,638
gearing up for and turns out what it was

201
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,399
gearing up for was to try to spread the

202
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:30,800
message of this plant out to the world

203
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:33,959
and so it just it came by all of my

204
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,960
loves being funny making content and

205
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:38,120
dealing with these plants that we love

206
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:40,638
it was just a matchmate in heaven and as

207
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,918
soon as uh I started in it that I mean

208
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,800
I've been obsessed uh ever since it's

209
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:46,758
pretty much been my uh the last two and

210
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,360
a half years all I do is just think

211
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:53,158
plants lighting YouTube uh engagement

212
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,840
Community it's been so fun so the plant

213
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:58,079
provides and man it's provided a lot to

214
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,158
me that's awesome yeah let me just say

215
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,878
you have done an incredible job over at

216
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:06,560
the D Grow Show helping uh produce their

217
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,919
shows huge huge increase in quality

218
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,000
looks like viewership has increased

219
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,038
significantly since the old producer to

220
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,038
the new producer you and so all the

221
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:15,560
changes that you're doing have been seem

222
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:17,240
to be very positive you're doing a great

223
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,879
job over there so just want to say that

224
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,079
I appreciate it we uh had our Channel at

225
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:26,080
88,000 subscribers and was deleted by

226
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:28,318
YouTube for linking out to seeds which

227
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,198
are you know 100% fine I don't know

228
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,639
what's going on and so that was a big

229
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,440
kick in the teeth and that really REM

230
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,080
motivated me I could have just joined

231
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,240
the team and been like oh all right you

232
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,959
know what what do you guys want to do

233
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,839
but when that happened it's like well do

234
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,359
we quit you know like this is a

235
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,080
conversation that was had in a meeting

236
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,839
do we stop doing this and I was like we

237
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,399
can't you know I just through

238
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,720
coincidentally one of the things that

239
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,200
brought me to Colorado was growing and

240
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,000
so I had grown for a while but uh I as

241
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,360
as I told to grow it before we started I

242
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,039
was like I killed more plants than I

243
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,759
probably grew in my early early day days

244
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,399
so I knew it was going to pay the rent

245
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,120
when I got to Colorado so I'm I'm

246
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,759
dyslexic I'm not a huge reader so I'd be

247
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,879
on the forums i' be on your roll it up

248
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:11,439
your icy mag you know but how much can

249
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:13,799

250
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,279
thing called podcasting had like came

251
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:19,078
out in 2014 you know not in 2014 but

252
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:21,679
really gained popularity in the 2013

253
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:23,679
2014 and I got into the Adam Dunn show

Hydro organic synthetic what's your

269
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:03,039
style I've always been uh indoor guy

270
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:05,240
it's uh it started as like uh you know

271
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,159
my friend's older brother he was the guy

272
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,320
that introduced me to like consuming and

273
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,879
everything so this is like a family I've

274
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,079
known since I was two next door

275
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,519
neighbors best friends with the youngest

276
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,439
brother friends with all the older

277
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,039
brother I was like I was a de facto

278
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,279
sibling so when he would go out of town

279
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,679
I would get tapped he's like hey I'm

280
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,200
going to Hawaii for two weeks like I'm

281
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,919
gonna teach you how to take care of my

282
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,360
plants like oh cool you know and pretty

283
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,120
all I remember from that day he would

284
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,320
just yell at me more C cow mag put your

285
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,159
cow mag on it you know that's all that's

286
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,760
all I remember from that and then so I

287
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,120
was like well when I get here I need to

288
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,958
really get my uh my game dialed up so as

289
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,919
I started educating myself it became

290
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:45,119
quite clear that the easiest most

291
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:46,599
effective way for indoor cultivation for

292
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,399
at least how I was going to be

293
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,159
performing it was to be to into Coco I

294
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,559
messed around with Pete for a while and

295
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,679
uh you know having a day job I'd be out

296
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:59,439
in the world and sometimes I I couldn't

297
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:01,078
get home in in time and i' I'd get lazy

298
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,959
and it and it wasn't exactly like the

299
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,319
thing that was the most important to me

300
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,078
when I was living in Iowa it was just

301
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,079
kind of like how do you get good product

302
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:10,719
well you know you can meet all the

303
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:12,879
people in the world and pay out the nose

304
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,720
or you can get yourself some some

305
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:17,320
genetics and just go that way and so

306
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,600
when I uh started taking the serious as

307
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,320
go I I became a Scotty real disciple he

308
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,480
was always a a a growing Coco sort of

309
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,760
guy so I was like all right let me start

310
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,240
growing a Coco found great results

311
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,278
immediately and what I found is that

312
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,320
when I did it right when I used the

313
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:34,278
nutrient program the way it was designed

314
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,160
and gave the plants what they needed and

315
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:38,958
the time they needed all of a sudden I

316
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:41,439
found I don't even need cow mag it was

317
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,838
one of my early insights of like uhoh

318
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,240
the people that taught me might not know

319
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:50,040
as much as I thought they knew and that

320
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,680
hole in my knowledge base I'm a I'm a

with blender 3D animation software I

327
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,440
just I just have to learn and when I

328
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:11,240
have a hole in my knowledge I get real

329
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,519
crazy about it and I have to learn

330
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,320
everything and uh that's what's kind of

331
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,600
queued me on to my journey that's what

332
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,399
became so perfect about getting in the

333
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,079
com media game is that like I truly I'm

334
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:22,440
not in this just for a paycheck I

335
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:24,319
literally I you know the paycheck's

336
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,000
great pay your rent with the rock you

337
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,040
know we're just able to pay our rent

338
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,519
through the patreon supporters and all

339
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:33,599
that sort of good stuff but uh yeah I

340
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,639
just I really love a good puzzle and I

341
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,120
think growing is one of the funner

342
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:42,000
puzzles that I've came across so yeah

343
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,440
Coco indoor uh went from HPS to LED

344
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,278
that's a whole conversation that you

345
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,639
know that's what kind of got us going on

346
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:50,919
this topic right immediately uh as far

347
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,680
as lighting and yeah so I I I I've

348
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:54,599
learned a lot in the last little bit and

349
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:56,479
it just keeps changing month to month

350
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,480
I'm I'm stoked sounds like you're real

351
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,120
passionate about this community and

352
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,519
you're real driven to learn more and

353
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:08,879
improve and all that stuff so that's

354
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:11,480
awesome to see pack of nerds bro pack so

355
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,958
let's get into lighting now one of the

356
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,759
things I want to ask right off the bat

357
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,278
we have a lot of folks who are shopping

358
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:20,039
for grow lights right here in

359
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:23,360
2025 what should Growers look for when

360
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:26,278
purchasing a grow light well that's the

361
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,320
the question is uh is right off the bat

362
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:31,198
is uh what it's kind of like it's the

363
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,360
the map you know where are you trying to

364
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:34,838
go is where you're going to try to get

365
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,879
you know so like let's say you're in a

366
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:39,800
tent and you're inside your bedroom I

367
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:42,679
mean right off the bat we've kind of

368
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:43,799
nixed HPS out of the the picture you

369
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:46,078
know we're not going to be able to grow

370
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:48,240
with high-intensity Lighting in a in a

371
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,958
small tent atmosphere it's it's you have

372
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,839
to air cool that's one of the things

373
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:55,119
that's really uh got me educated on this

374
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,320
like even 10 years ago is you know

375
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,639
growing in a pre- LED environment where

376
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,040
you're stacking lights together in a

377
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,720
small room room they all had to be

378
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:04,919
vented hoods so we'd run air through the

379
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,160
hoods so we'd remove all that heat and

380
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:08,838
the byproduct of that is you were

381
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,919
cooling the bulb and so color

382
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:14,800
temperature like you you'd have like an

383
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:17,078
more orange uh uh number uh for the HPS

384
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:19,319
and that's that number is it's an actual

385
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:21,039
temperature color is temperature and so

386
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,879
when you're lowering the temperature of

387
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:25,759
the bulb to its actual spec operating

388
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:27,759
thing you're losing a lot of spectrum

389
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,079
and so I started learning like why is it

390
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,440
my friends that like have like gavitas

391
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,198
strapped to their ceiling and their

392
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,880
giant basement are getting what you know

393
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:37,559
the same gen we'd all share genetics

394
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:39,559
back then it was it was tougher you know

395
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:41,479
there wasn't all the sea a lot of the

396
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:43,000
the the genetic Banks were over in

397
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,440
Europe and stuff and you'd be ordering

398
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,519
off the back of magazines like it was

399
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,279
sea monkeys or something you know it

400
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,759
wasn't wasn't a lot of trust as far as

401
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:52,399
like the system so it was really relying

402
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,159
on the community so we all share

403
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,759
genetics we find things that we we liked

404
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,759
we got the Forum cut of the of the

405
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:01,079
cookies like back back back in the day

406
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,720
when first came out and I'm noticing

407
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:04,679
these guys are getting way better

408
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,920
results than I am and the only thing

409
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:08,239
that was different is I was venting them

410
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:10,519
and then turns out as I started

411
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,278
educating myself sure enough I was

412
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,879
losing a lot of spectrum you're losing a

413
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,000
lot of power that's supposed to be

414
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:18,879
hitting those things so if you're

415
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,440
choosing I would say uh there's a lot of

416
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:24,399
controversy controversy right now about

417
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,920
HPS versus LED and one of the things

418
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,198
that's very very interesting is genetic

419
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:31,759
expression phenotypic expression and I

420
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:34,159
work with The Jug guys The Jug dealers

421
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,639
over at New Millennium nutrients and uh

422
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:39,278
jiren always likes to say phenotype is

423
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,480
genotype times environment so you and I

424
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,679
have the same cut we got the same

425
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,600
genetic profile but then you put it

426
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,958
outside and I put it in a tent and

427
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,959
they're going to express differently and

428
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:53,159
so I always wondered where did all the

429
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:55,879
things that I loved in the 2000s where

430
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:58,198
did they go I still I still get the the

431
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:59,759
name some oh here's the strain you want

432
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:02,078
and they give it to me and it's got the

433
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,399
name and it looks kind of like it but it

434
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,559
didn't taste the same didn't smell the

435
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,240
same didn't didn't quite look the same

436
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,559
what happened was it was it genetic

437
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,480
drift you know was it all the Clones are

438
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,399
being abused or people lying is it not

439
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,199
the thing that I did and then as I

440
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,159
started meeting more people more

441
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:20,799
trustworthy guys that are ogs in the

442
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,559
game I started getting the real stuff

443
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:26,039
I'd get the real cuts from the real

444
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,838
people they still didn't Express why is

445
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:30,159
that and so I started digging in another

446
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,519
hole in knowledge and I realized oh it's

447
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:35,360
because they're not grown under vented

448
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:38,720
hoods with GH nutrients packed together

449
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,318
in a tiny room VPD out of control like

450
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,519
even bad growing conditions if there's a

451
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:47,559
a a phenotypic expression that you enjoy

452
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:51,039
the only way you're going to get it is

453
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:53,318
through an quote unquote an inferior

454
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:56,639
growing process because what plants were

455
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:59,519
selected under is what they will Thrive

456
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,318
under especially if you're not running

457
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,879
things like if you get a genetic and you

458
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:05,438
just take clone from clone from clone it

459
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:09,000
will acclimate to your environment but

460
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:11,319
it will never it it's code is locked but

461
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,558
when you uh take something and you breed

462
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:15,159
it like if you back cross something and

463
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:17,199
you self it and you self it against

464
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,120
itself and you the genetic remains it

465
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,079
shuffles the deck and I always remember

466
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,000
that family that I grew up with they

467
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:25,359
were I was friends with the the old the

468
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,480
middle the youngest brother well the

469
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,798
oldest brother he was like a genetic

470
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,839
copy of the mom the Middle Brother was

471
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:34,679
like a genetic copy of the dad and the

472
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:36,599
youngest brother was like a direct split

473
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,759
and I started understanding like oh okay

474
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:39,359
there it is when I was dealing with

475
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,640
plants I started getting okay recessive

476
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,599
genes I see what's happening it's like

477
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,640
some of the grandparents come in some of

478
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,279
the mom comes in different eye color

479
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,440
different skin tone different hair color

480
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:52,558
it's like okay I get it and then you

481
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,840
take the twin brothers and you raise

482
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,440
them in different places and they're

483
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,798
going to act completely different Twins

484
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,840
and raised in the same room finished

485
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:01,000
each other's sentences yet twins ra

486
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:02,759
raised across the country can have

487
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,159
surprisingly different lives it all

488
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:08,079
started coming together and this comes

489
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:10,000
back to lighting where one of the

490
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,519
biggest things that you can do to change

491
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,159
your environment is the lighting so if

492
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:17,918
you chose an HPS versus LED one of the

493
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:21,720
things that really makes LED Superior

494
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:24,520
Superior to HPS is that you don't need

495
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,400
the cooling for a a watt is a watt so if

496
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:29,720
I have a th000 watt LED and I have a

497
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,159
th000 watt HPS technically speaking more

498
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,880
light there the same exact heat but the

499
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:37,400
LEDs produce more light for that heat so

500
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,200
your output is there so it's not that

501
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,120
LEDs are cooler or you know there's more

502
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,519
efficient so a watts of watt a watt of

503
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:47,319
heat equals x amount of BTUs and you're

504
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:48,599
going to get what you get turns out that

505
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:50,720
when you measure things like Leaf

506
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:53,399
surface temperature right when you go in

507
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,079
there with a little a little thermometer

508
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,000
gun and you point at at the leaf the you

509
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,798
need to run your room slightly hotter

510
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,079
with LED because there isn't that

511
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:04,400
infrared there's almost no infrared that

512
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:06,960
when you see those red diodes in an LED

513
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,400
that's them trying to stick some red in

514
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,519
there because they don't come with it

515
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,360
whereas HPS uh high pressure sodium just

516
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,639
kicks out the IR that's why you could

517
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:17,479
feel the heat coming off it that's why

518
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,759
if you go to a restaurant you you'll see

519
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,319
the IR heaters you'll you'll have

520
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,640
something that isn't glowing it's not

521
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:26,399
red it's not hot you know to to like

522
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,038
visually hot there's no color coming of

523
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,600
it yet you're getting blasted with this

524
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,400
this heat that's coming off of it and

525
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:36,158
that's the just a pure IR lamp that's

526
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,880
hitting it you think that uh that

527
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,440
wouldn't have a you know we'll just I'll

528
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,520
raise the temperature a little bit but

529
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,840
what is kind of interesting is that the

530
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:47,119
leaf surface temperature it actually

531
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,798
affects like the the the biotic

532
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,719
structure of what's going on like heat

533
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,480
stresses and things even though the

534
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,880
there's micro boundary layers that

535
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,038
you're plant creates that's why we like

536
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,320
a lot of air flow and get them going and

537
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:00,519
it breaks those micro boundary layers

538
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:03,399
across because it it it's just got this

539
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:05,200
micro layer of insulation we'll call it

540
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,038
and so you want to knock that all off

541
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,798
and so just raising the temperature of

542
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:11,919
your room doesn't necessarily get the

543
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:13,639
plant leaf surface temperature all that

544
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,679
much higher whereas if you're bombarded

545
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,000
with that IR it gets it way higher I was

546
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:21,519
like oh so even the things that we kind

547
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,720
of consider not valuable in growing oh

548
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,000
it is affecting the metabolism of the

549
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,360
plant this is why I'm not getting that

550
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,798
that diesel expression I want that 2 3

551
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:36,279
diesel you know like uh lifestyle Rob

552
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:37,839
and I when we were hanging out in Vegas

553
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:40,678
you know we're just the right amount of

554
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:43,678
Boomer Millennial that uh we remember

555
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,840
that 2003 diesel baby where'd it go it

556
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:50,280
still exists you just have to grow it

557
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:52,000
wrong according to 2025 standards got it

558
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:53,879
yeah I feel like these days particularly

559
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,679
in the H grow Market that I feel like a

560
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,240
majority of people are going with LED

561
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:02,720
versus the hid you know hi that whether

562
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:05,599
bhps or MH or even CMH falls into the

563
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,440
hid category high intensity discharge

564
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,319
but yeah as far as what to look for when

565
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,759
purchasing a grow light I think first

566
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:12,480
thing right off about is coverage area

567
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:14,839
what area are you trying to cover if

568
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,759
you're looking for a 2ot x 4ot coverage

569
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:18,000
area well you can filter it down by

570
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:20,158
there and then you can kind of get into

571
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,839
the granular details of what's the power

572
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,120
output what does the light spectrum look

573
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,480
like and then you can even look at like

574
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,599
the dodes drivers people get really

575
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,558
really deep into what's the btu the heat

576
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:32,000
output so there's a lot of different

577
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:33,798
things that people can look at when

578
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
they're shopping for an LED grow light I

579
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:38,519
want to narrow it down to Spectrum here

580
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,558
you see a lot of grow light listings

581
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:43,038
that have full spectrum they advertise

582
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:45,000
full spectrum is it safe to say that

583
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,200
it's sufficient for growing medicinal

584
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,079
plants from seed to harvest if it's

585
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,400
labeled as full spectrum of course one

586
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,240
of the things that we'll like to talk

587
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,679
about I work with a company with jug

588
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,759
dealers DLI Dutch lighting Innovations

589
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,480
and one of their sayings is like you can

590
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:03,278
get any crappy Chinese light off of

591
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,919
Amazon and run it for a year and that

592
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:08,679
thing will be banging out pretty decent

593
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,278
Harvest you know but as you get to your

594
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:13,320
third run your fourth run your fifth run

595
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:15,839
all of a sudden there's degradation and

596
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:18,519
the light output starts dropping and the

597
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:21,798
power input doesn't drop so as your

598
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:24,359
efficiency starts LEDs uh cheaper LEDs

599
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:27,079
that you get they will be like I said

600
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:29,798
the the watt per output is higher than

601
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:31,519
than an HID light but but after year two

602
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:33,359
you go measure it it can drop down it

603
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,519
can get down to half so you're loose you

604
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,879
can lose three quarters efficiency if

605
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:40,879
you don't so one of the main things is

606
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,400
the old saying buy once cry once get one

607
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,480
of the trustworthy companies you know I

608
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,519
I personally I have two tents that I

609
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,400
grow in one has the DL Dutch lighting

610
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,759
Innovation LED in it the other's got a

611
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,880
hlg Horticultural Lighting Group LED in

612
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,599
it they're both high quality they both

613
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,919
have a you know I almost couldn't tell

614
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:00,719
the difference between the two as like

615
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,840
output although I use one for uh vegging

616
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,798
mainly and the the other for the flower

617
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:07,038
but it it's a big thing it's also to be

618
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:09,000
considered as a power of your house

619
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,640
that's another reason that led is so

620
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,960
important most HID lights are 240 you

621
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,840
know you have to you have to plug it

622
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,840
into a dryer Outlet or get a special

623
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:18,918
switcher box then goes into a ballast

624
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:20,480
that then goes into the light it's just

625
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:23,200
it's so much production whereas if you

626
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,120
can just get a a decent LED light plug

627
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,200
it into to the wall of your bedroom it's

628
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:29,558
it's kind of like the reason that

629
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,558
there's a Renaissance in game right now

630
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:34,119
is because all of a sudden you know

631
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:36,558
there is a time where carbon filters

632
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:39,959
didn't exist you know people would spray

633
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:42,038
gels and cologne and crap all over their

634
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,798
rooms because how do we get rid of this

635
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:47,038
smell and so between carbon filtration

636
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,839
then the upgrade in the tent technology

637
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,558
then the upgrade in the lights all of a

638
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:55,079
sudden literally everybody for under

639
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:57,918
$1,000 doll you can get a perfect setup

640
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:59,759
and grow amazing plants and then all of

641
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,799
that sunk cost it you you will pay

642
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,640
yourself back however you're getting

643
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:05,359
your your material you're putting in

644
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,799
your body however you're getting that

645
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,519
you're paying for it and uh it's gonna

646
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:12,440
it mounts up faster than you think if

647
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:15,158
you write down $20 here $50 here you're

648
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,640
going to hit that, pretty quick you'll

649
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:18,278
probably spend it whereas if you get

650
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,278
good equipment it's going to last for

651
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:23,880
years and you're going to 20x your

652
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:26,278
initial Sun cost so buy once cry once

653
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,960
get one of the reputable companies it's

654
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:29,159
really good I know Samsung just went out

655
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,759
of business

656
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:32,559
everything or not out of business but

657
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:34,679
out of the LED game and they're one of

658
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:37,480
the big breakthroughs that that that

659
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:41,320
gave us this full spectrum and on that

660
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,759
subject I was always uh a CRI guy so

661
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:47,359
this is color rendering index the sun

662
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:49,879
being 100 right so we're trying to match

663
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:52,199
our lights against the sun like what is

664
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:55,240
this and HPS is very low it's it's like

665
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,319
50 CRI at best you mentioned metal Halli

666
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,880
that's uh or not metal Halli but ceramic

667
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:02,158
metal Halli and that's what I end up

668
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,919
going with I was growing under a

669
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:09,120
double-ended 315 so I was running 630s

670
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:12,320
as a double double bulbed uh hoods and

671
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:14,239
the CRI jumped from like 50 up to 80 so

672
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:17,200
when these LED lights came out well God

673
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,919
they're like 95 oh my god well this must

674
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,038
be the answer to all my problems well it

675
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,399
is and it isn't if you're growing once

676
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:25,200
again that selection problem if you're

677
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:26,798
growing modern genetics and a lot of

678
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,038
people are growing the modern genetics

679
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:30,519
and there's no problem with that I love

680
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:32,119
people hate on the candy strains the

681
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:34,359
fruit strains I love you know I love

682
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:36,479
it's all a place in time like I I love

683
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:38,879
the the gassy stuff the fuy stuff the

684
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,440
rank nasty stuff but uh there's a place

685
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,480
for that sort of stuff and so these grow

686
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,440
lights are great they mimic the sun

687
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,759
almost exactly but not perfectly and

688
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,278
especially once again like uh humans are

689
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:54,679
a great uh analogy some people are grown

690
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:57,119
in the Saharan PLS you know and they're

691
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:59,200
bombarded with sun they have darker skin

692
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,319
some people were raised the the foggy

693
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,080
London Town and they have lightskins so

694
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:04,918
they can try to pull up more stuff it's

695
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:06,960
the same sort of thing you put me in the

696
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,799
Sahara Desert I'm not g to get much work

697
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,640
done you want me to work the Fe you know

698
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:13,558
I'm not going to get anything done yet

699
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,038
you put me in a a dark basement which is

700
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:17,519
the ambient line oh yeah I know I know

701
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:21,079
exactly what to do here that's your

702
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,480
plans if they were bred to be under HPS

703
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:25,398
that's where they want to be they'll do

704
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,120
fine they'll exist if you force me like

705
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:29,119
you put you kidnapped me and put me in a

706
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,079
mine I'll work I'll be sunburn as hell

707
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,798
and I'm going to I feel like hell but I

708
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:35,278
will get the work done same with your

709
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:37,879
plant it it it will do what you needed

710
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:40,519
to do but it's not going to do the thing

711
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,278
that it did back in the 90s 2000s but if

712
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:44,038
you're growing that modern stuff yeah no

713
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:47,000
problem it's the it's literally Picture

714
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:49,759
Perfect matchmate in heaven I uh I love

715
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,798
the LEDs for the the ease of use that's

716
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:54,398
the that's number one yeah it does make

717
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:56,839
them a lot easier to use so if full

718
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:58,558
spectrum is sufficient for growing from

719
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:01,000
seed to harvest how about about the

720
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:03,558
companies that have specialized light

721
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,759
spectrum that they advertise here's this

722
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:07,918
spe the spectrum that we have does it

723
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:10,278
actually translate to better results or

724
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,480
is it mostly marketing gimmicks well

725
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:16,038
company to company for sure some of them

726
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:19,159
it's just marketing gimmicks right the

727
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:21,158
thing that gets me about it is that the

728
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:24,399
thing that the trend that's going on

729
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:26,240
amongst like you know I am very we we

730
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:28,759
have a a check your privilege sort of

731
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,798
saying around my world I get it I hang

732
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:33,359
out with some of the best Growers with

733
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:35,599
the best genetics the best equipment all

734
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:37,240
the best knowledge and I get to watch

735
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,038
them from afar what's going on what are

736
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,399
they doing what are they talking about

737
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:43,640
and one of the things that's popped up

738
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:45,439
is is mixed Spectrum I'm seeing a ton of

739
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,200
people like in commercial facilities

740
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,519
they're doing these checkerboards where

741
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,278
they're putting an HPS light in between

742
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:54,359
four LEDs and then they'll just be

743
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:57,079
checkerboarded all over and so it's it's

744
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:59,719
fat this is where the science is way not

745
00:27:57,079 --> 00:28:03,119
caught up to the the Bro Science the the

746
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,159
anecdotal data the anic data if you will

747
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:06,918
and uh you hear a lot of people I see a

748
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,360
lot of people and I'm watching people

749
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:11,519
who's putting food for their children on

750
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,319
the table based on these results and

751
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,038
they're swearing hey man I'm getting

752
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:18,000
better results with these mixed

753
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:21,879
spectrums confuses me because if we have

754
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,519
a full spectrum LED light right like

755
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:27,720
it's covering all the bases that the HPS

756
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:29,399
is right well maybe not necessarily it

757
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,480
there there's little gaps in the spect

758
00:28:29,398 --> 00:28:34,278
if you look to a spectrograph it's not

759
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,919
just like a flat sine wave you know it's

760
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:38,759
not just like here it is it's it's like

761
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,120
a it's a squirly durly sort of thing and

762
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:43,440
different compounds are diff are

763
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,359
generated by different things and so

764
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,519
like as I mention with the infrared

765
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:50,278
there I would have thought as I educated

766
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,519
myself there was nothing to do with ir

767
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:54,839
in there but turns out there is so all

768
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:56,798
of a sudden I'm like all right well I

769
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:59,119
don't have all the science and there is

770
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:00,918
not science the only science that's

771
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:02,518
coming out is done by the lighting

772
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:04,960
companies

773
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:07,120
themselves I know you take that with a

774
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,000
grain of salt but when you have all the

775
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,599
homies who feed themselves and their

776
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,679
children based on these numbers and

777
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:15,480
they're saying that these mixing of

778
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:17,640
spectrums is having a result not just on

779
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,599
quantity but also on quality and I think

780
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,159
as we move forward that's what we're all

781
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:24,558
really trying to hit now like the the

782
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,640
days of yield being number one I think

783
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:29,000
those are fairly over and I think

784
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,759
quality is King these days I totally

785
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,519
agree with you on that one it seems

786
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:34,240
except for the the commercial facilities

787
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:36,120
we do have quite a few people that are

788
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,399
working in commercial facilities and

789
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:40,439
they still have a hammer coming down on

790
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,398
them trying to get more yield you know

791
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,440
from the uppers for the most part

792
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:46,199
quality uh but there are still some

793
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,360
folks that that have to stra for yield

794
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,880
because uh their business relies on it I

795
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:52,240
guess you can say I want to get a little

796
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,600
bit deeper into far red light which is

797
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,480
something that you had mentioned a

798
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,759
little bit here can you talk to us about

799
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:01,278
a far red light specifically between 700

800
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:03,480
and 750 NM what does it do to the plant

801
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:06,679
and then also is it worth supplementing

802
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:09,000
far red light or do most grow lights

803
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:11,679
have enough far red that it's not worth

804
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,319
supplementing well it's uh this is

805
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,038
something that uh this is like the

806
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,639
something i' I've been hearing about for

807
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:21,158
10 years but once again still is ever

808
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,440
evolving it's it's uh it's funny we had

809
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:26,840
we recorded episode of The Jug dealers

810
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,640
podcast the other day and uh I I happen

811
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:30,480
to know once again I I've been in the

812
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,240
world I've watched certain people use

813
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,278
far red to effective results for the

814
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,720
most part and then I'm talking with

815
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:40,519
these guy here the jiren and Gabe two my

816
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,880
most like respected grow brains in all

817
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:43,440
the thing and they both look me in the

818
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,240
eye and they're like you're wrong and I

819
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,679
go bro well I was like I thought they

820
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,038
were G be yeah of course the flower

821
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,278
initiation that stuff works and they're

822
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:52,839
like no doesn't do anything doesn't

823
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:54,759
exist in nature I'm like so this

824
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:56,398
controver you know this goes deep like

825
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:58,278
this is one of the those controversial

826
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,199
things there's the there's the and

827
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:03,000
there's the UV we'll get to I find that

828
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:05,600
to be not since organic versus synthetic

829
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,960
have we had as much debate in the

830
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,359
growing community and so as far as the

831
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,759
far red some people can be confused

832
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:14,479
right off the bat so we should probably

833
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:18,038
clarify that I mentioned the red earlier

834
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,599
as as the IR the infrared and so when uh

835
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:23,638
as grow mentioned the par when you see a

836
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:25,359
par chart it's what does a plant see

837
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:27,599
think of it like the visual spectrum of

838
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:29,759
a human right we don't see X-rays and

839
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:32,119
gamma Rays we don't see microwaves and

840
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:33,398
radio waves but we see visible light

841
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:35,398
same sort of thing with the plant it's

842
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:37,558
got a visual spectrum that it can see

843
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:39,959
but just the same way as x-rays Shores

844
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:42,079
hell affect us if we're bombarded with

845
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,919
them same thing things outside of the

846
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:47,599
par range also affect the plant and so

847
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:50,159
uh infrared is outside of that par range

848
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:51,398
way outside of it and so it it's like I

849
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,200
said that's why it's interesting it's

850
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:55,439
like oh it's outside of par yet it still

851
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,360
does affect the metabolism of the plant

852
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,080
there's also that's infrared now we're

853
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,558
discussing far red so that is slightly

854
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:04,319
on the end it's just dipping over the

855
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:07,558
side of the par range a little bit in a

856
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:10,839
little bit out and it does quite a bit

857
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:13,038
of sort of stuff uh a lot of negative

858
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:16,158
stuff as well as positive one of the

859
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:17,599
main things that uh I think as I can

860
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,679
speak because you know there's there's

861
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,638
not a ton of science science out there

862
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,720
as as far as this stuff once again it's

863
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:25,558
a lot of the companies and I trust a lot

864
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,159
of the companies Shane from migro I

865
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:30,278
trust this guy you know I there

866
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,360
characters out there Jer from the Dutch

867
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:36,000
lighting Innovations I trust him so when

868
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:38,439
these guys say things I listen and so we

869
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,679
can start with uh the negative sort of

870
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,840
effects that the far red will have so

871
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:45,240
far red is a just like if you can think

872
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:47,839
like the reason that x-rays are so

873
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,679
powerful is they're a really small wave

874
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:51,359
they're very intense it takes a lot of

875
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,038
energy like if I want to make something

876
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:55,558
like jiggle fast I got to put a lot of

877
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:58,798
energy with it and so versus a radio

878
00:32:55,558 --> 00:33:01,278
wave right it's this giant huge thing it

879
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:03,638
can wrap over your house and still get a

880
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:05,919
signal on the next one whereas if I shot

881
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:07,359
you know an x-ray burst at your house

882
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,880
it's going to hit the wall it can't go

883
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:12,918
over it's too small of a wavelength and

884
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,880
so you can think of the the uh the far

885
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:17,038
red kind of like that it's a bigger

886
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,639
thing so it can get past your canopy it

887
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:22,638
can get past your leaves it can get down

888
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:24,519
lower so if you have a forest and you

889
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:26,240
got a bunch of trees that are shading

890
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:28,319
out a plant a little plant that's trying

891
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,440
to grow down there our little favorite

892
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:33,278
High valued plants that we like to grow

893
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,440
if we put that underneath a giant forest

894
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:37,359
canopy right it's not going to get any

895
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,960
of that that delicious par that we're

896
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:41,519
talking about but what it is going to

897
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,240
get is some of that far red because it

898
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,000
can get through the canopy and it still

899
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:48,440
hit it and what that tells the plant is

900
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,240
stretch baby stretch you're not getting

901
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,320
any of the yummy light that we need to

902
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,880
grow we're getting all that red light

903
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:56,319
and that means that there's light above

904
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,720
us but we ain't getting it so we got to

905
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:00,759
grow up there so one of the things that

906
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,679
I've seen a lot is people that will uh

907
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:05,960
use uh their far red lights all cycle is

908
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:08,079
that they're getting a lot of stress now

909
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:11,519
some people like the stretch this is a

910
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,119
interesting thing of uh at the the 58

911
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,398
jug dealers guys we like to say it's

912
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,399
it's like think of uh like a bloom

913
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:19,519
booster right is like an additive right

914
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:21,598
it's not it's not required it's just

915
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:24,878
it's GNA get you farther I think of like

916
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,200
the these UV the the the far red things

917
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:27,799
like that that these are the the

918
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:30,039
additives that we're adding and some

919
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,200
genetics need more cowc that's where it

920
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:34,559
came from some need less some need so

921
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:36,638
same thing some genetics some cultivars

922
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,078
as we're now calling them they uh or

923
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,919
should probably should have always been

924
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,720
calling them strains are for mushrooms

925
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:45,480
and and flu cultivars are for plants

926
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:48,239
just to clear up any we still call it

927
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,760
strains we can still say it no one's

928
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,398
don't don't be a Snicker puss don't

929
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,639
don't talk down to someone because they

930
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:56,000
say strain we get it cultivar you know

931
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:58,160
but some of these cultivars they uh they

932
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,358
need more than others and so if you got

933
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,960
like these little tiny squat plants that

934
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:04,559
you want to grow up maybe you you have

935
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,320
techniques for increasing that that

936
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,519
intern noal spacing one of the things

937
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,200
the reasons we don't like stretching is

938
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:13,358
because it takes no to node of those H

939
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:15,879
those flower sites it increases it and

940
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:17,279
then you get these giant topheavy things

941
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,838
that want to bend and break and you're

942
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,839
having to give them more silica so that

943
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:22,199
way they have a little bit more

944
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:24,320
elasticity to them and everything just

945
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:26,960
gets changed so if you're one of these

946
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,880
like highlevel thinking Growers like my

947
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,599
buddy from bre genetics a JLS monster

948
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,559
he's one of one of the best breeders in

949
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:37,079
Colorado and he was like I like I run my

950
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,679
far red midcycle I I like a little

951
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:40,920
stretch like he'll grow these this

952
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:44,118
Colonel chem that I love I I got some of

953
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,880
it sitting over here and man amazing

954
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:48,559
he's like it's too squat the nose are

955
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:51,000
two together I I sometimes I get Bud

956
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:53,000
mold okay I would have never thought

957
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,960
like okay maybe this guy wants dress cuz

958
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,719
he he's getting betrus at the end of his

959
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,639
Harvest he's like this loosens up some

960
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:03,078
of those tight flower sights and okay

961
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:04,598
I'm learning holy crap here's another

962
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:06,880
thing I would have been like that's bad

963
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:09,720
I could say that's bad don't stretching

964
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,920
as bad is it not if that's exactly what

965
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:14,480
you want to keep your plants that keep

966
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:18,119
you happy and healthy happy and healthy

967
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:20,800
so uh on the positive side of it is the

968
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:23,318
flower initiation this one my friends

969
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,200
have legit been doing forever you can

970
00:36:23,318 --> 00:36:27,719
think of it just like I talked about

971
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:31,118
with how red are these big giant things

972
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:33,159
well before our eyes can actually see

973
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,920
the sunrise we're actually starting to

974
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:37,279
get bombarded that's why it starts to

975
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,519
heat up a little bit before the sun even

976
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,480
comes up we're getting hit with that IR

977
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:43,358
first it's the biggest it's coming down

978
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,039
it's cooking up our atmosphere and then

979
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:47,759
that far red is coming in and so even

980
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:50,318
though the sun hasn't crested the

981
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,119
horizon yet it's still throwing some of

982
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:55,079
that far red that our eyes can't

983
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:57,920
necessarily even see but the plants can

984
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:59,560
and that tells them to wake up same

985
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,318
conversely when the Sun starts to go

986
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:04,279
down it crosses the Horizon and then all

987
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:06,920
that visible light is blocked by the

988
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,280
horizon yet some of that red is still so

989
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,639
big just like the x-rays hitting your

990
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,000
house versus the radio hitting your

991
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,318
house you can hit the radio in a big

992
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,079
city even though it's blocked it it your

993
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:19,960
plant sees ah there's that outgoing red

994
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,119
time to go to sleep so people called

995
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,039
this the flower initiator you'll run it

996
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:26,440
for 15 minutes before your lights turn

997
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:29,920
on and 15 minutes after your lights turn

998
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:32,119
on this tells that them that it is fully

999
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,599
time to wake up and fully time to go to

1000
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:37,000
bed and they will go it takes your

1001
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,800
plants you know an hour to so I I once

1002
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,639
again cultiv our specific some some

1003
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,200
plants go to sleep very very fast and

1004
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:45,358
some other take forever just like people

1005
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:47,159
it's almost like life is like life you

1006
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:49,679
know they're so much like us it's it's

1007
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:52,559
almost spooky and so it will tell them

1008
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:54,118
wake up go to bed and they go faster and

1009
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,960
then so they're they're able to produce

1010
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:59,358
sugars and oxin at night and interchange

1011
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,358
with the roots the the roots and the the

1012
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:03,078
chots as we call them they both are

1013
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:04,880
doing different roles one's creating

1014
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:07,400
oxygen people always think that the

1015
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,559
plants well they create CO2 well did you

1016
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,039
know the roots create oxygen that's why

1017
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:14,000
terrariums can exist blew my mind when I

1018
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:16,279
started Le you can put a plant in a

1019
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,239
sealed bottle and it will live because

1020
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:22,760
its roots are producing oxygen and its

1021
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:25,679
uh flowers are producing CO2 and it can

1022
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,560
circulate through the two blew my mind

1023
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,239
and so if you start shortening those

1024
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:30,559
days or not shortening your days but

1025
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:32,799
getting them to go to sleep faster

1026
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:35,759
you're actually day after day in a you

1027
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,519
know a 60 to 80 Day flower cycle you're

1028
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,680
actually pulling several days off some

1029
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:41,920
people are saying I'm pulling a week off

1030
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:43,480
of my plants this is the point I try to

1031
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,039
make with jiren and Gabe on The Jug

1032
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,358
dealer show where they're like no it

1033
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:48,199
doesn't do anything and I was like I

1034
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:49,719
think we're talking quality I don't

1035
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:51,838
think it does anything to increase

1036
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:54,039
quality you're not going to get more oil

1037
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:57,639
and those voc's from this but you're

1038
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:58,880
taking time off of your schedule so it

1039
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:00,838
it it's more I guess this could be

1040
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,720
lumped into the yield category because

1041
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:05,239
if you can jam another harvest in your

1042
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:07,279
garden each year even if you're losing a

1043
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:09,239
little bit of weight run to run you're

1044
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,200
gaining that weight back plus by jamming

1045
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:12,519
a whole extra harvest in there I think

1046
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:14,039
that's something we all can get down

1047
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:16,119
with got it yeah so they're definitely

1048
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:17,960
pros and cons and sounds like that con

1049
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:19,960
that you mention is really subjective

1050
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,800
right actually I had uh somebody on the

1051
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,599
podcast pretty recently Dave Baker shout

1052
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,560
out to him he was on there talking about

1053
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:28,640
autof flowers and one thing that was

1054
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:31,440
pretty interesting is he actually uses

1055
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:33,960
the far red for autof flowers cuz he

1056
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,119
wants that stretch he wants that veg

1057
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,599
growth uh to happen you know he wants

1058
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:40,720
the biggest plant as he possibly get in

1059
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:43,640
an Autoflower obviously we all know that

1060
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:45,480
it's limited on his time frame for veg

1061
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:48,159
it automatically flips to flower right

1062
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,800
so that veg time frame is super super

1063
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:52,000
important if there's any stunting growth

1064
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,839
you could have a significantly smaller

1065
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,838
plant so he utilizes far red supplements

1066
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:58,239
far red in order to get a bigger stretch

1067
00:39:56,838 --> 00:40:00,199
on his Auto flowers before they actually

1068
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:01,719
flower I thought that was interesting

1069
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:03,799
that is interesting and this is what

1070
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:05,039
learning looks like people go people ask

1071
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,960
questions like how do you know that and

1072
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:10,920
I go cuz someone smart told me it once

1073
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,599
and I listened autof flowers that's fasc

1074
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,599
because exactly like I talked about like

1075
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:17,240
getting Bud rot and stuff that's usually

1076
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:19,280
an outside uh outdoor sort of thing you

1077
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:21,358
know but a lot of people do get it

1078
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,440
indoors and I could totally see you get

1079
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,480
that that giant Christmas tree you can't

1080
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,318
really top an Autoflower the way we

1081
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,000
would top a normal photo periodic plant

1082
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:31,639
plant so you get this giant Christmas

1083
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,079
tree Cola going up I could see totally

1084
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:35,799
increasing that intern Noles length

1085
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,560
gives you more room for those buds to

1086
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:41,000
grow tells them there's more space for

1087
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:44,400
them this makes sense to me absolutely

1088
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,519
so would you say it's worth adding in

1089
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,440
like for people actually go out and buy

1090
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:52,119
the lights to supplement or is it just

1091
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,679
kind of like an a plant additive where

1092
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:55,318
you can get it but it's kind of like an

1093
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:58,078
optional thing and it'll take you a

1094
00:40:55,318 --> 00:41:00,960
little bit further but it might not be

1095
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,280
worth it for some so you can type into

1096
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,039
Google Google image search at some point

1097
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,920
after this podcast everyone listening

1098
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:10,599
just type uh law of the minimums chart

1099
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,960
or graphic the law of the minimums right

1100
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:15,240
so if you take a barrel and it's all got

1101
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,240
level sides right you can fill the water

1102
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:19,799
up to that level of the barrel now you

1103
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:22,439
take one plank of that barrel and you

1104
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,200
hammer it down five inches right well

1105
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,079
the height of what that Barrel can

1106
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:28,239
contain is now its lowest point right

1107
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:30,480
that's just what it is the water's going

1108
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:32,838
to flow out that hole until it reaches

1109
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,039
to that equilibrium point of that that

1110
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:36,960
lowest Plank and that's your new water

1111
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:38,838
level you pull that plank up now you can

1112
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,800
fill it all the way back up and it's

1113
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:42,440
it's a great chart I think it's Lee

1114
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,920
Big's law of the minimum I can never

1115
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,880
remember exactly the the Fella's name I

1116
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,318
I I learned from college educated people

1117
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,119
yet was not college educated so I have a

1118
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:52,920
hard time retaining some of the it's

1119
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,920
it's a knowledge fire hose out there

1120
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,358
these days grow it's hard to maintain

1121
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,519
all this stuff you know so yeah look up

1122
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:00,400
law of the minimums and uh I would say

1123
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:02,519
for

1124
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,880
sure we we'll say this even about

1125
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:08,280
something as pedantic as CO2 don't worry

1126
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,480
about it until everything else is dialed

1127
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,480
in if you're not hitting your DLI your

1128
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,639
preferred ppfd you're not even going to

1129
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,280
be able to uh like you're going to get

1130
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:19,759
that's another thing about giving it

1131
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,760
more light it's it's this weird cause

1132
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,280
and effect Loop right don't worry about

1133
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,240
having CO2 if you don't have enough

1134
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,680
light and then don't worry about putting

1135
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:31,039
more light in if you don't have CO2 it's

1136
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:33,239
like a weird all all apes are monkeys or

1137
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,159
all monkeys are Apes but not all apes

1138
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:37,358
are monkeys sort of thing it like

1139
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:39,480
depending on what you're doing is so I

1140
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:40,960
would say for sure just a short answer

1141
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,358
to the question is yeah it should be one

1142
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,720
of the last things you're worrying about

1143
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:47,239
but if you have your room dialed in and

1144
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:49,558
you're like I don't know how I could

1145
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:51,000
possibly make it any better yes now

1146
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:52,440
we're talking you're the person that

1147
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,119
should be kind of thinking about that

1148
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,440
but if you're a new grower you're buying

1149
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:57,720
your first tent you're like should I buy

1150
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,880
some Far red no

1151
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:03,358
no your your light will contain enough

1152
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,160
to be perfectly adequate I think that's

1153
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:08,318
a good way to put it now how about

1154
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:10,799
ultraviolet light UV light 100 to 400

1155
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:13,960
nanm what does that do to the plant and

1156
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,119
is that worth supplementing or do most

1157
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,119
cites have UV in the spectrum that

1158
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:21,640
supplementation isn't really necessary

1159
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:24,599
so here we go this is the one that uh

1160
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:27,920
puts fear in my chest because all of a

1161
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:30,880
sudden girl I'm a man of science right I

1162
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,800
I study Quantum Mechanics for fun I love

1163
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,599
the particle Zoo you want to talk about

1164
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,280
how time dilation works with muons life

1165
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,318
cycle being shorter than they can get

1166
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,839
from the Earth to the sun yet they crash

1167
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:43,199
in with the Earth every single

1168
00:43:40,838 --> 00:43:46,519
millisecond forever how is that possible

1169
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:49,558
I'll talk that for you forever right I

1170
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:53,358
am a man I love science I love love love

1171
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:55,079
it questioning science is part of

1172
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:57,358
science folks I know we live in the most

1173
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:59,119
divisive times ever and when you say

1174
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:02,159
things like ah you can't believe the

1175
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:04,920
science you get put in a category right

1176
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:07,358
of like you're you're a political person

1177
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,880
you're over here you you voted for this

1178
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:14,119
person all sorts of crap gets brought up

1179
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:17,640
so I with a big asterisk go into this

1180
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:20,280
next subject is that once again there's

1181
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:22,000
not many people doing science on this

1182
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:26,400
and the people that are doing the

1183
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,239
science are scientists they're not like

1184
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,240
consumers the way we are there they're

1185
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:32,399
not looking at it from the perspective

1186
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:35,598
that we're looking at it right so just

1187
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,440
what this is we we totally planted a a

1188
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,240
fertile bed of seeds for everyone's

1189
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,639
knowledge base that now we can catch up

1190
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:45,598
to this because expression right

1191
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:49,039
different plants different cultivars

1192
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:51,160
different genetic profiles recessive all

1193
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:52,920
these different things are in affected

1194
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:56,000
by different things so now I'm a

1195
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,960
scientist I have to do things one at a

1196
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,639
time I can't test multiple varials

1197
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,679
simultaneously I have to get a baseline

1198
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:04,239
agree with my peer group that this is

1199
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:06,719
the Baseline and then when I want to

1200
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:08,838
change something I change one variable

1201
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:10,679
and then I I do I get more results then

1202
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:13,199
I'll go back I'll change something else

1203
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:15,039
and you start doing these onetoone tests

1204
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:17,838
over and over and over and over again

1205
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:20,400
thousands of times and then a full data

1206
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:23,480
set that's full and useful starts to

1207
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,720
emerge well we only have a handful of

1208
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,920
guys you know and one of the ones that

1209
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:29,519
gets thrown in my person face every

1210
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,720
single day of talking about this would

1211
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:35,719
be our esteemed member of this community

1212
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:38,239
Bruce Bugsby I love Bruce Bugsby very

1213
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:40,719
very much this guy is a genius but the

1214
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:43,318
man is a scientist so when he talks

1215
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:45,279
about things like so I I'll get i'll I'm

1216
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:48,358
burying the lead here a guy like Bruce

1217
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,680
Bugsby says UV does not affect plants

1218
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:53,480
right we've done the studies it's it's

1219
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:55,199
not creating more oils it's not creating

1220
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:59,880
more cannaboids it's not creating more

1221
00:45:55,199 --> 00:46:02,639
flavor molecules it's just not well I

1222
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:04,119
happen to live in Denver I work for the

1223
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:05,679
Dutch lighting Innovations I work with

1224
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:08,800
these guys very closely they're they're

1225
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:12,358
part of my friends friends and they sell

1226
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:15,640
a purpose made UV light it's a it's a

1227
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:18,920
hid uh it's not HPS necessarily it's

1228
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:22,078
it's inspired by it but it's a UV just

1229
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,920
light it it's a it's a burning ball of

1230
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,839
gas that's just like the sun putting off

1231
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,880
all that UV that's what's growing here

1232
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:31,759
it's one of the only full spectrum UV

1233
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,160
lights there there's UVA there's UVB and

1234
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,400
there's UVC you can think of a is just

1235
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:39,078
ambient a Scotty reel on the dude grow

1236
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,880
like to say b stands for burn and C

1237
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:45,480
stands for cancer you know it's gonna it

1238
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:47,760
hurts you UVC is not good so in our

1239
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,838
Earth's atmosphere thankfully since UVC

1240
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,839
is so dangerous for us it filters out

1241
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:55,880
almost all of the UVC but we still get a

1242
00:46:52,838 --> 00:46:57,679
lot of the UVB and a lot of the UVA and

1243
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:00,599
so they come out with a light that

1244
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,759
directly mimics that it's exp it's you

1245
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:06,200
know it costs money and I'm watching

1246
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,680
people all over put it in and keep it

1247
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:09,799
and I'm saying what's going on so my

1248
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:11,239
friend turpan Kyle he's one of the best

1249
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,359
Growers I've ever met I know this guy

1250
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:15,719
for 10 years he is literally the

1251
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:18,039
smartest man as far as like Hands-On

1252
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:20,639
plants he loves the science he loves the

1253
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:22,480
data he loves talk and grow and he goes

1254
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:25,519
I'm going to try it uh you know and he's

1255
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,760
a he a just the way that a scientist

1256
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:30,239
would only do one very at the time he

1257
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,280
had his his room dialed in what else can

1258
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:35,558
I do he's looking for tpine production

1259
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:37,319
he calls his company tacana and uh it's

1260
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:39,160
all about those turps and so he's like

1261
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:40,838
let me try it and he just he's

1262
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:43,838
instantaneously he's like dude after

1263
00:47:40,838 --> 00:47:45,239
three runs I mean I'm getting this is

1264
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:48,679
once again anecdotal he's like I'm

1265
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:52,358
getting like eight to 10% more tpin as

1266
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:55,399
you do he'll do uh BHO runs of of the H

1267
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:57,358
of the oils and it fractionates and so

1268
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,200
you'll get like a crystallin layer

1269
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:00,719
you'll get like a and it's it's

1270
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:03,399
different lay and at the very very tippy

1271
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:05,118
top is just pure Tarin and so you can

1272
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,720
scoop those off you can weigh them you

1273
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,760
can actually do data and he's like man

1274
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:13,279
I'm getting 10% more TPS off of this

1275
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,800
stuff one of the other things that UV uh

1276
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,040
will do once again so that's why I

1277
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,039
preface with that the there's

1278
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:19,679
controversy here you got groups of

1279
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:21,318
people in the academic Community saying

1280
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:22,519
that it does nothing you got groups of

1281
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:24,480
people in the

1282
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:27,838
Hands-On practitioners and they're

1283
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,960
saying it does so just the that's why I

1284
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:33,519
press I'm a man of science but in the

1285
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:35,280
aspect of UV I'm choosing because the

1286
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:37,800
science isn't I believe the science

1287
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,640
isn't in yet the data that we have is

1288
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:43,880
pointing at a suggestion but I don't

1289
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:46,239
take that at face value yet maybe in

1290
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,760
2030 if that's still if there's all

1291
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:49,558
these tests are going and all there's

1292
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,880
more and more and more bug bees of the

1293
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:53,480
world all confirming this I go okay

1294
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,760
maybe my friends are full of crap and

1295
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,240
they got that 10% not full of crap but

1296
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,400
they did get that increase maybe there's

1297
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:02,279
some other variable that they weren't

1298
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:05,440
aware of but as it stands now I believe

1299
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:08,280
that it does and uh but one consequences

1300
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,079
if you are a yield person it reduces

1301
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:13,000
biomass but it

1302
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,880
increases the we think of the the the

1303
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,760
Trikes and everything all all that is

1304
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,798
all the oils that's the sunscreen it

1305
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,480
puts it on there as a protective layer

1306
00:49:18,798 --> 00:49:22,358
it doesn't want things landing on it it

1307
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:26,240
doesn't want bombarded by the all that

1308
00:49:22,358 --> 00:49:29,039
UV so we like positive stressors in our

1309
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:30,879
world you know I'm a big uh some people

1310
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:33,400
do the low stress training I'm a high

1311
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,240
stress trainer boy I I bust I'm breaking

1312
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,559
necks in there I love I love it you know

1313
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:42,598
just like you know you'd see like old

1314
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:44,319
you know [ __ ] John Claude vanam you

1315
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:46,798
know movies and they're they're punching

1316
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:48,759
gravel you know like like ah and they're

1317
00:49:46,798 --> 00:49:50,880
they're creating micr fractures in their

1318
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,680
hands and when those micr fractures fill

1319
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,720
in with all the calcium and things that

1320
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:56,279
we take you're stronger and beefier and

1321
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:59,078
you got these giant thing well we've all

1322
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:01,160
seen if you break a plant it gets this

1323
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:02,839
giant knuckle on it right well my buddy

1324
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:04,759
Jay Maestro he goes well to hell with

1325
00:50:02,838 --> 00:50:07,358
knuckles I want my whole plant to be a

1326
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,160
knuckle so I break I'm popping

1327
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:10,679
everything my plants just look dead

1328
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:12,358
people I grow with are just like what

1329
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:14,838
have you done you've killed it you

1330
00:50:12,358 --> 00:50:16,960
monster 24 hours later it's right back

1331
00:50:14,838 --> 00:50:18,880
to praying you know it's all it's all

1332
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,240
good we're trying to create positive

1333
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:24,079
stressors and uvi I believe is one of

1334
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:26,199
the most positive stressors you can get

1335
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,798
now you can't work under this it is bad

1336
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:29,439
for you so in these commercial

1337
00:50:27,798 --> 00:50:31,440
facilities that do have these they run

1338
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,039
them about three hours a day and people

1339
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,559
can't be under them they are quite

1340
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:38,239
dangerous uh don't play games with UV uh

1341
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,640
you can get the light here's here's

1342
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:42,439
another thing about UV is that you

1343
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:44,239
talked about Shady marketing practices

1344
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,039
here's where the shadiest marketing

1345
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:49,558
practices come out is the different

1346
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:52,000
types of UV best UV out through glass

1347
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:53,920
from a bulb you know the these these

1348
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
high pressure bulbs the UV the Dutch

1349
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,519
sliding UV bulbs that's the best hands

1350
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,760
down it's the only only product that's

1351
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:01,559
like that on the market after that you

1352
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,640
get the bars you have these bars the

1353
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:06,359
bars work the bars are great you can get

1354
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:09,480
good UV a out of it you can get a little

1355
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:12,000
bit of UVB no C obviously and we don't

1356
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:14,480
want too much C anyway so I I also like

1357
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,440
the bars the once again migro no no

1358
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,920
relation to them just like the guys they

1359
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,400
educate the world they give it out for

1360
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,240
free and say if you like what we give

1361
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,760
you come try our products well I have

1362
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:26,639
friends that have tried it and had good

1363
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:31,440
results so far then we get to the LEDs

1364
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:33,199
that is a noggo LEDs cannot maintain UV

1365
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,440
so think about if you put a red chair

1366
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:37,719
out in the sun bright red chair right

1367
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,200
big you got this lawn chair you it's all

1368
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:41,358
right it's cherry red it's gorgeous now

1369
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:43,838
you put it out there for a couple

1370
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:47,039
Summers you go out there it's like light

1371
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:49,558
pink after a couple years why is that

1372
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:52,000
because all that UV light is breaking it

1373
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:54,240
down you know it it it attacks Plastics

1374
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,719
and it just degrades them quite quickly

1375
00:51:54,239 --> 00:52:00,558
well your LEDs are essentially made of

1376
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:04,159
these different plastic uh uh molecule

1377
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:06,000
yeah polymers and such and they uh they

1378
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:08,199
break down so literally as you're

1379
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,880
running UV through these things they are

1380
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:11,399
degrading themselves so just like I

1381
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:14,680
talked about spectral degradation of

1382
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:16,720
Cheaper LEDs there is no LED on Earth

1383
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:18,759
it's literally breaking itself from the

1384
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:20,919
inside so maybe you'll get a couple

1385
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:24,079
weeks of great production out of some of

1386
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:25,159
these diode based UV systems but they're

1387
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,640
going to they're going to break

1388
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:28,920
themselves pretty quickly and now you're

1389
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:31,558
just running heat in your garden to a

1390
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:33,400
light that is producing near nothing so

1391
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:35,839
that I would say go with the the full

1392
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,880
the Full Spectrum Glass then the bars

1393
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:40,318
avoid the LEDs good to know now you

1394
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,838
mentioned DLI quite a few times here in

1395
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:43,838
this podcast I want to get deeper into

1396
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:45,039
it I have a lot of beginners on this

1397
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:48,199
podcast some might not even know what

1398
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:50,519
DLI is can you explain what is DLI and

1399
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:53,480
what do you aim for so I had kept

1400
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:55,239
referencing DLI it's a clever company

1401
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,039
name Dutch lighting Innovations that's

1402
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:58,919
not what we're referencing here

1403
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:01,798
is they kind of took that as like their

1404
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:04,318
cute name of like ah D what it actually

1405
00:53:01,798 --> 00:53:07,239
means as far as like botanic you know

1406
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:09,838
Botanical means is uh is Daily Light

1407
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:12,000
integral how much light can a plant

1408
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:14,719
absorb in a day think of your plant as a

1409
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,239
bucket and phot photons like raindrops

1410
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:20,480
you know how much can it actually hold

1411
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:23,679
and once a bucket's full it's full and

1412
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:26,159
so the the DLI of your plan is how much

1413
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:28,798
of those raindrops of energy can it hold

1414
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:31,118
per day how much does it need to be

1415
00:53:28,798 --> 00:53:33,199
called a day here's one of the things

1416
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,880
that really got me like one of those

1417
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:36,960
knowledge gaps that's like oh I got to

1418
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,760
do some homework this is fascinating

1419
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,079
I've been growing 10 years before I

1420
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:44,240
learned we call it a photo period right

1421
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:46,519
we should really call it is like an

1422
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:48,439
anti-photo period or lack of photo

1423
00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:51,358
period here's the thing that actually

1424
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:55,119
dictates your photo cycle is the

1425
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:57,880
nighttime this blew my mind Scotty and I

1426
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:01,160
at dude grow you know we'll we'll enjoy

1427
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:02,920
our favorite uh compounds late at night

1428
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:04,960
and we'll have discussions all about

1429
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:07,280
this it's all we ever talk about and we

1430
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:10,400
started thinking about this insane

1431
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:13,319
concept right we play God with our

1432
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:15,358
plants right we we give them we are we

1433
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:17,679
let there be light we say and so there

1434
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:20,558
is light that is you know we we have

1435
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:23,960
that level of control they don't know

1436
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:25,960
what a 24-hour day is right so think

1437
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,000
about if you had a a a cultivar

1438
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:31,519
especially that was not hungry for light

1439
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,798
and you hit its DLI super early what

1440
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:36,039
necessarily because you're the the the

1441
00:54:33,798 --> 00:54:38,639
photo period is the 12 hours of dark

1442
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:40,480
that's what creates a a flower cycle and

1443
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:42,078
so we can't interrupt that we don't want

1444
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,000
to interrupt that all that much it'll

1445
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,480
create a lot of stressors in the plants

1446
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
maybe that's what you're looking for

1447
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:50,199
some people I know like our friends in

1448
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,039
Southern Colorado down there will uh

1449
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:54,480
they recommend certain like you know do

1450
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:56,599
a 168 sort of thing and that creates

1451
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,798
controversy works for them they they

1452
00:54:56,599 --> 00:55:00,240
they like that positive stressors you

1453
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:02,559
know maybe they're trying to stress

1454
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:05,078
their plant in in a manner there but

1455
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,960
just to keep it we want our genetic

1456
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:08,480
stable we don't want them selfing doing

1457
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,440
any sort of weirdness throwing nanners

1458
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:13,119
or anything so we want to make sure we

1459
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,519
hold that 12 hours of Darkness but

1460
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,760
there's nothing special about that 12

1461
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:20,400
hours of light all we need is to hit our

1462
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:23,280
DLI hypothetically speaking Mr Grow what

1463
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,720
if we had a plant that had a low DLI

1464
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,319
we've got a high intensity light or LED

1465
00:55:25,719 --> 00:55:30,358
that that's really kicking those photons

1466
00:55:27,318 --> 00:55:34,358
down and we hit our DLI in eight

1467
00:55:30,358 --> 00:55:36,239
hours couldn't we theoretically just cut

1468
00:55:34,358 --> 00:55:39,400
cut cut this show give him the 12 hours

1469
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:42,519
and now we've got a 20h hour day a 20

1470
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,960
hour day and what's that gonna do for he

1471
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:45,920
get if we're talking about flower

1472
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:48,720
initiators sneaking in an extra Harvest

1473
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,240
could you sneak in another Harvest could

1474
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:53,679
you could be doing six or seven runs a

1475
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:55,358
year all of a sudden my head starts

1476
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:57,679
going crazy I start looking into it

1477
00:55:55,358 --> 00:55:59,639
there's these like gas slamp techniques

1478
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:02,358
where they like will do things like give

1479
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:04,519
veg plants an hour like mid cycle all

1480
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:06,400
this crazy stuff I I recommend going

1481
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:08,759
through the old forums so much of it is

1482
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,200
a Bro Science but so much of it still

1483
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,039
works you know some one of the things

1484
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:14,558
that blows my mind about science is how

1485
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:16,160
much the old boys were right holy crap

1486
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,599
they were you were right I don't know

1487
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:21,239
how you knew that but you actually right

1488
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:23,359
about it so yeah there's a lot of old

1489
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:24,798
test so here we are thinking like I

1490
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:26,440
thought Scotty was like no there's been

1491
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:29,199
these different light schedule sort

1492
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:32,519
before I never heard of it a 20-hour day

1493
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:34,519
that's unheard of a nine a nay week what

1494
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:37,400
what are we doing so all of a sudden it

1495
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:39,440
became like the uh the the main thing I

1496
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,760
was thinking about was like man is there

1497
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:45,079
any place that documents DLI of

1498
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:47,000
cultivars like see how like bait we're

1499
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:49,160
so infantile in our knowledge of these

1500
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:54,199
things like these like there is so much

1501
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:57,078
room to grow no pun intended as Growers

1502
00:56:54,199 --> 00:56:58,519
like holy crap like is there any anyone

1503
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:00,039
leave it in leave a comment there's a

1504
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:02,079
great time right in this video right

1505
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:03,079
below you have any experience with this

1506
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:06,240
because this is I'm going to check back

1507
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:09,160
the comments and I like Andrew huberman

1508
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:11,118
calls it anec data so anecdotal stories

1509
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:13,879
from your smart friends it's not just

1510
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:15,519
anecdotal it's anic data man that counts

1511
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,358
you telling me things work you're a

1512
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,880
smart guy and I believe you and you have

1513
00:57:17,358 --> 00:57:21,239
a little bit of your own data to prove

1514
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,480
it I believe it so leave a comment I

1515
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:25,038
want to know I'm going to read them yeah

1516
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:27,358
I think DLI is one of those things that

1517
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:29,000
isn't talked about as much as it should

1518
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:30,639
be in my opinion right A lot of people

1519
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,358
just go after the power what how much

1520
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:34,798
power and ppfd are you giving your

1521
00:57:32,358 --> 00:57:36,558
plants right but having the light cycle

1522
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:39,000
knowing how much how long your lights

1523
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,839
are on and how much par you're giving

1524
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,798
running those numbers to a DLI

1525
00:57:40,838 --> 00:57:44,480
calculator which you can find online

1526
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:46,759
just by doing a Google Search and then

1527
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,880
figure out how much DLI your plants are

1528
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:51,440
actually getting and then is that too

1529
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,318
much or is it not enough and you know

1530
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:57,318
for medicinal plants around 40 I think

1531
00:57:53,318 --> 00:57:58,599
is safe I've heard upwards of 60 DLI

1532
00:57:57,318 --> 00:58:00,239
what do you typically do you have a

1533
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:03,559
specific number that you kind of aim for

1534
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:08,399
for DLI or or what these are the so I uh

1535
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:11,519
unfortunately had a a a little uh

1536
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,519
relationship ending over covid you know

1537
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:15,400
they being locked down together for a

1538
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:17,199
couple years we uh got on each other's

1539
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:19,358
nerves a little bit I had my mom pass

1540
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:21,159
away and all sorts of drama went on in

1541
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:23,639
that couple years and so I went from

1542
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:25,639
growing in amazing Grow rooms my whole

1543
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:27,440
I'd never grown in a tent my whole life

1544
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:29,598
I've been growing 10 years never GNA I

1545
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,280
always had to grow rooms giant two-car

1546
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:34,119
garages fully sealed you know nothing

1547
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:36,839
gets in nothing gets out it was the

1548
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:39,318
Glory Days and so I just started growing

1549
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:41,599
intense this last year and then I just

1550
00:58:39,318 --> 00:58:43,920
moved to my new apartment so here in the

1551
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:46,280
last like two years while while I've

1552
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,760
been increasing all of my grow knowledge

1553
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:51,079
my anic data has not been there I

1554
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:53,079
haven't had my friends or my hands in

1555
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:54,920
the dirt doing so I get all the

1556
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:56,640
different uh reports from my friends

1557
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:58,960
like you telling me like okay these are

1558
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:01,480
the numbers but the way my brain works

1559
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:03,639
is like since I don't you know I'm not

1560
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,079
in there with with you know the photon

1561
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:07,279
app or all these different things that

1562
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:10,079
come out checking out what the ppfd and

1563
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:13,039
everything is uh I don't have my

1564
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,599
personal personal recommendations so I

1565
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:16,359
don't I don't have numbers for you I

1566
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:17,960
like like I said I'm a man of science I

1567
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:19,598
do not ever want to come on a big

1568
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,679
platform like this and spew anything

1569
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:24,559
that's out of pocket so I will defend UV

1570
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:26,679
I won't give you a DLI based on my

1571
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:29,839
personal experience because I don't know

1572
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:31,639
and it's tough uh you can burn up your

1573
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:32,920
plants a little bit you know you you can

1574
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:34,879
have a little bit of that you got to

1575
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:37,280
make sure that's where the CO2 comes in

1576
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:39,318
if you are going to increase that DLI

1577
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,760
and especially that ppfd and I believe

1578
00:59:39,318 --> 00:59:44,880
ppfd is photosynthetic Photon flux

1579
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:47,400
density I always say you go from Stoner

1580
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,559
to quantum mechanics in four moves in

1581
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:52,838
this game it's ridiculous you go well

1582
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:55,359
you do it like this why well because uh

1583
00:59:52,838 --> 00:59:59,199
radiation of light goes like this why oh

1584
00:59:55,358 --> 01:00:03,440
well because as different uh photons go

1585
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:05,798
why because quantum mechanics I don't

1586
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,440
know that's so funny yeah I appreciate

1587
01:00:05,798 --> 01:00:09,719
your honesty there you know not

1588
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:12,880
everybody knows everything man this hour

1589
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:15,279
has flown by we are coming up towards

1590
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,480
the end here and we just scratch the

1591
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:20,039
surface when it comes to lighting there

1592
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:21,400
is so much more that can be come with

1593
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:23,359
this conversation maybe we can do a part

1594
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,039
two in the future where we can go even

1595
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:26,440
further on this but we're going to wrap

1596
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:27,880
things up here can you tell listen to

1597
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:29,639
how they can find you and what you have

1598
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:32,519
