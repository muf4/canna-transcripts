1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,759
coming up on Garden talk your grow tent

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:06,439
is like your house for your plants right

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:07,879
you want something really solid you want

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,280
something reliable you want something

5
00:00:07,878 --> 00:00:11,320
that's not going to fall apart in the

6
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,160
middle of your grow for me the AC

7
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,280
Infinity fans with the speed controller

8
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,600
are kind of a no-brainer just because

9
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,358
the speed controller is so huge as far

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,640
as keeping the environment nice getting

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,560
your you know humidity in check it will

12
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,000
alert you if there's a problem that has

13
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:28,320
saved my butt a number of times from

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,800
some from some problem it you're buying

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,359
something that's going to last you you

16
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,558
know maybe a decade that's a lot of

17
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:36,558
electrical bills you know so spending a

18
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,359
little bit more to have something so

19
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,280
your bills a little lower every month

20
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:41,640
will pay off in the long term there's

21
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,280
places to go cheap and then there's

22
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,439
places to invest is how I like to think

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,039
of it and lighting and environment are

24
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,960
two places where it's worth spending a

25
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,879
little extra money to get efficiency

26
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,480
quality and get the kind of you know

27
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:53,479
performance you

28
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,718

97
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,158
things in your garden right I'm sure

98
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,120
we'll touch on a bit of both in this

99
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,639
episode but first before we get deep

100
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,599
into the topic what I like to do with

101
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,958
all the guests is an introduction can

102
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,679
you tell us a little bit about yourself

103
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,680
and how you got into gardening yeah yeah

104
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,438
I uh first got into gardening a little

105
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,280
over 10 years ago I started having

106
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:10,039
digestive problems and uh I found

107
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,318
medicinal plants really helped me out

108
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:14,199
you know and learning to grow my own and

109
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,279
also just the therapy of growing you

110
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:18,358
know learning to spend time in the

111
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,679
garden connecting with plants connecting

112
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,240
with nature you know really made a big

113
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,240
impact on me and I just fell in love

114
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,079
with it and now I love sharing that with

115
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,560
other people you know a big focus in my

116
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:30,359
life has been trying to share that

117
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,199
excitement about growing plants with as

118
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,000
many people as I can so uh love helping

119
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,080
people get started love people helping

120
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,079
people start new Gardens and um yeah

121
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,680
just love

122
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,240
gardening happy to talk about it yeah

123
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,879
you mentioned that your main focus is on

124
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,720
helping new gardeners get started with

125
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,079
their first grow and that's why I

126
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,320
thought this topic would be perfect cuz

127
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,000
I get a lot of new gardeners reaching

128
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,519
out to me and asking about equipment

129
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,680
there's so many different pieces of

130
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:57,639
equipment particularly when growing

131
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,840
indoors that you need to get in order

132
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,280
for the plants to grow at a good rate

133
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:05,319
and be successful with the grow so kind

134
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,239
of going through the different pieces of

135
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:08,439
equipment I don't think we're going to

136
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,918
get touch on every single thing but I

137
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:11,839
think we can get a good chunk of it done

138
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:14,758
today and just kind of go through each

139
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:17,439
piece of equipment or tool and then um

140
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,879
yeah just some notes for beginners some

141
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,478
advice you have on things and uh it

142
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:24,478
should should go pretty good from there

143
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:26,199
so I think starting with grow tent or or

144
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,800
really grow room when you grow growing

145
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,560
indoors for example I have a spare

146
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,840
bedroom I think it's a 9x2 12 and then

147
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,199
in that spare bedroom I have a couple

148
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,159
grow tents cuz I want to have one tent

149
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,800
that's for vegetation stage you know a

150
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,280
different light cycle than the flowering

151
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,918
stage so I personally have a 2x4 tent

152
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:44,159
and also a 4x4 tent so when a new grower

153
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:46,159
kind of reaches out to you and they're

154
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,720
like what should I get for a grow tent

155
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,360
what do you typically answer to that

156
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,319
yeah well I usually ask people two

157
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,840
questions and one is first off what are

158
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,879
your goals right like are you trying to

159
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,560
grow a ton or are you just trying to set

160
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,079
up a little hobby grow for yourself

161
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,879
maybe you and a significant another

162
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,839
something or are you looking to you know

163
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:06,240
really max out your space as best as you

164
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,519
can and then the other question I like

165
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,918
to ask people too is you know like

166
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,719
what's your budget and what kind of

167
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,000
space are you working with like what

168
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,639
tell tell me more about where you're

169
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,879
trying to put this grow you know because

170
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,759
if you have a big space Maybe putting

171
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,839
some little tents in there make sense or

172
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:22,280
maybe it makes sense to go crazy and

173
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,879
fill the whole room with plants you know

174
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:26,598
it just depends on what are your goals

175
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:28,639
and what kind of budget you've got and

176
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:30,560
uh but I love both approaches I grow in

177
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,079
both a big room in one building that I

178
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,160
have I have a separate building out back

179
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,000
with its own little environment set up

180
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,560
with its own little you know air

181
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,439
conditioning and all that sort of stuff

182
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,160
and then I also use tents you know I use

183
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,800
tents here in my office actually I have

184
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,000
two tents right in here um but I love

185
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,400
small tents I love big tents I love big

186
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,240
rooms it all just depends on you know

187
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,799
what's your budget what are your goals

188
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,319
and what kind of space you have um you

189
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,319
know everybody's Situation's a little

190
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,919
bit different but tents are great

191
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,840
because like you said you can have a veg

192
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,279
tent and a flower tent setting up

193
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,038
different environments like that gives

194
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:06,159
you so much opportunity to try things

195
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:08,079
try you know if you want to try doing

196
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,080
some plant breeding or you want to try

197
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,120
keeping some other plants or doing some

198
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,560
cloning or you know having separate

199
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,280
environments really gives you that

200
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,000
option to do a lot of cool stuff so

201
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:19,719
always tell people two tents if you can

202
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,279
or two separate rooms you know really

203
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,560
opens up a lot of possibilities so say

204
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:25,679
they want to go with two different tents

205
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,439
and they've got their sizes picked out

206
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,918
is there a particular brand that you

207
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:32,240
recommend or brands that you say to

208
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:34,038
avoid because maybe they're poor quality

209
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,598
yeah I always tell people with tents

210
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:38,719
going for something wellmade is really

211
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:40,519
important your grow tent is like your

212
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,759
house for your plants right you want

213
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:43,240
something really solid you want

214
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,639
something reliable you want something

215
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,000
that's not going to fall apart in the

216
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,960
middle of your grow so I've always used

217
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,879
gorilla grow tents in my garden I love

218
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,878
Gorilla Grow Tent they make really good

219
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,560
quality stuff and on top of that they've

220
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,720
also had many years to perfect their

221
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,519
design uh it seems like they're always

222
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,720
kind of adding little features or making

223
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,918
little tweaks to the tent to make it

224
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,840
more user friendly I really like they've

225
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:06,439
got double doors that kind of open up in

226
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:09,519
front of them it gives you access kind

227
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:11,319
of all the way around your plants um

228
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,000
however also say too I really like AC

229
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,240
Infinity makes some really good tents as

230
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,158
well so if you're on more of a budget AC

231
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,759
Infinity tents are really good they

232
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:20,918
don't have the double do they only have

233
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:22,560
a single door but they're still really

234
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,318
well made still have a lot of great

235
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,918
features and they're not going to fall

236
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,680
apart on you you know that's so much of

237
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,799
the big thing with grow tents is there's

238
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,639
some really kind of lower quality ones

239
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,399
out there that aren't going to last you

240
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,799
you know much more than a grow or two at

241
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,879
the most so I always tell people invest

242
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,240
in a good tent it's something to you

243
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,360
know spend a little more on getting

244
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,038
something quality and something wellmade

245
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,800
and you got two great options there with

246
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:47,519
AC infinity and Gorilla Grow Tent they

247
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:50,319
both make really sturdy tents that are

248
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,959
going to last you many grows so I've got

249
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,959
some Grill grow tent shorty tents I've

250
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:57,119
been using for like five plus years and

251
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:59,439
they' still look brand new so big fan of

252
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,078
quality tents whatever you go with I

253
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,480
I've used both gorilla and AC Infinity I

254
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:06,039
use the AC Infinity tents now that's

255
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,399
what my 4x4 and my 2x4 is the AC

256
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:10,159
Infinity ones one thing to keep in mind

257
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,440
grow tents I feel like some people

258
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,799
aren't aware that some of these tents

259
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,240
don't have that back window or side

260
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:20,399
window I should say and some people need

261
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,120
that so uh make sure that you you know

262
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,120
if you want that feature to where you're

263
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,720
able to access the other side of your

264
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,519
plants for example sometimes if you're

265
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,240
in like a 4x4 for example reaching over

266
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,480
your plants so going under your plants

267
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,159
it's easier to like walk to the side of

268
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,079
your PL side of your grow tent ZIP down

269
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:39,159
the side and then access the plants that

270
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:41,039
way so just keep that in mind that some

271
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:42,759
grow tents don't have that ability but

272
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,958
yeah Gorilla Grow Tent ran them for many

273
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:48,120
many years awesome quality AC Infinity

274
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:50,039
apparently is a thicker canvas density

275
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,159
now it's a thicker grow tent from

276
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:54,278
gorilla I've been running that it's been

277
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,759
fantastic I had a Mars Hydro One which

278
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:58,439
is pretty decent their 2x4 is actually I

279
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:00,120
think a foot taller than some of the

280
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,000
others on the market which I found to be

281
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,560
beneficial um cuz some of these 2x4 t0 I

282
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,879
think are only 4T tall me getting it a

283
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:09,518
5ft tall one actually made it easier cuz

284
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:10,759
I could raise up the the light more and

285
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,320
grow taller a little bit taller of

286
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:15,799
plants so something to keep mind point

287
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,800
and then uh the Vivo Sun ones I've had

288
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:21,879
those in the past way back in the day I

289
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:24,078
mean we're talking 2015 is I ran their

290
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:25,519
tents and there was some pinhole light

291
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,199
leaks in there so you definitely got to

292
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,360
be careful and keep an eye on those

293
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,120
things but I did get their grow tent

294
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,278
again recently um couple years back and

295
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,919
their quality was fine so um some of

296
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:37,559
these companies they may have poor poor

297
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,319
quality to begin with but they've gotten

298
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:41,759
better over the years so I fig I'd throw

299
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,079
those couple things out there definitely

300
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,480
yeah and I love one of my favorite

301
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:46,199
things about the gorilla tents is

302
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,519
actually uh a lot of them have the

303
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,480
ability to extend the height so if you

304
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,959
get a tent and you have a really short

305
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,839
space you can actually get the Gorilla

306
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:56,239
Grow Tent shorty which is what I'm using

307
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,240
in my office here I have a shelf in my

308
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,240
closet and I can't fit a normal siiz

309
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,480
tent under the Shelf but I can fit the

310
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,759
shorty in there and then if I want to

311
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,159
use if I want to use it in a different

312
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:07,720
space where I don't have to worry about

313
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,879
that limitation of having the Shelf

314
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,959
there I can put the extension kits in it

315
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:13,919
and make it you know back up to 7 feet

316
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:15,078
tall or whatever so keep that in mind

317
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:16,519
when you're choosing your tent too

318
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:17,919
that's a great tip is you know look at

319
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,399
what space you have and look at the

320
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,799
dimensions of all the different tents

321
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,480
and find the one that's going to fit

322
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,639
your space the best because you're right

323
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,240
some of them have different heights and

324
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,360
that can really affect your options when

325
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,959
you're growing yeah it's a good call it

326
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,278
even with the 4x4 I mean there's some

327
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:34,078
brands that are only have like a 6t tall

328
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:35,600
and then other ones are close to 7 ft

329
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:37,958
tall that that can make a difference

330
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,519
there too so yeah height is is Major

331
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:43,119
really important how about ventilation

332
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:44,480
system let's move on to that and uh what

333
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,959
we're talking about there for those that

334
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,120
are new would be the inline fan or

335
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:51,518
exhaust fan ducting carbon filter that

336
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,959
all makes up your your ventilation

337
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,159
system it's for air exchange what do you

338
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,719
typically run for a ventilation system

339
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:01,360
in these different sizes I mean you can

340
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,600
get 4in kits six-inch kits for example

341
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,919
what size grow tents would those go in

342
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,120
and and what brands are you typically

343
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:10,799
recommending uh I really like the AC

344
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,839
Infinity ventilation equipment uh I love

345
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,000
their automated speed controller uh

346
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,199
which I'm sure you're familiar with

347
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,759
those are excellent having the ability

348
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:20,000
to you know set a minimum and a maximum

349
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:22,639
temperature right there on the little

350
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,399
control panel and letting the controller

351
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,159
kind of control the fan speed to get the

352
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,320
environment where you want is so helpful

353
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:32,198
uh you know really has made growing in

354
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,680
my office here way easier uh I also

355
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:36,399
really like with that controller you can

356
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,559
set a maximum speed on your fan so if

357
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,120
you have your fan in your house or in a

358
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,159
bedroom or somewhere where there's

359
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,799
people sometimes you might not want that

360
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,198
noise all the time you might not want

361
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:48,879
the sound of a fan going full blast all

362
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:52,639
the time so I actually limit my fans in

363
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:54,879
my office to 60% so they you know never

364
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,159
go higher than 60% and that keeps them

365
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,000
running really quiet which means I'm

366
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:01,039
able to do things like podcast here in

367
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,879
my office without you know worrying

368
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,838
about raging fan noises in the

369
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,198
background um but as far as sizes go I

370
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,839
tell people usually if you're looking at

371
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:12,799
like a 3X3 and smaller you're probably

372
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,959
fine with a 4-in fan 4in ducting 4in

373
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:19,240
carbon filter all that uh if you're

374
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:21,239
going for you know maybe a 4x4 to a 5x5

375
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,320
you can probably get away with like a 6

376
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,639
in fan and when you start going for

377
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,839
something big like a 4x8 or a 5x9 or

378
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,959
something real big that's when you want

379
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,399
to be looking at 8 in or you know if

380
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:33,719
you're going really big that's when you

381
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,360
start looking at the 10in fans or the

382
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,440
really big beast fans but uh for most

383
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,440
small office grows or small tents I mean

384
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:45,120
I love a good 4x4 uh or a good you know

385
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,519
2x4 tent um you know usually a 4 in or a

386
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,759
6 in is good enough for that I know for

387
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,360
3x3 tents there are people who put the 6

388
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,839
in in there 6 in ventilation systems

389
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,199
which you just fine you get away with

390
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,360
and same thing with the

391
00:13:56,198 --> 00:14:00,838
4x8 I've ran the 6in ventilations in

392
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,480
there and it's been fine but yeah an 8

393
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,600
in might give you that little extra

394
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,000
speed that you might need if you really

395
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,680
getting a lot of heat generated from

396
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,198
those lights in there with those AC

397
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,719
Infinity fans I always recommend people

398
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,599
to go a little bigger because you can

399
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,839
turn them down right you can limit the

400
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,720
speed or because they've got the

401
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,600
automated speed controller in them

402
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,240
they'll turn themselves down if needed

403
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,240
so that way you know you have a little

404
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,600
extra fan capacity if you need it you

405
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,198
know if it's a really hot day and you

406
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,480
need a little extra fan power to keep

407
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,159
the tent cool you've got it um you know

408
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,278
and and you you can always tune it down

409
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,319
or run it a little bit at a lower speed

410
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:36,078
if you want it quieter or you know you

411
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,240
don't need as much and also if you're

412
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,439
running a carbon filter on there you

413
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,759
might want to go with a little bit cuz

414
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,360
that restricts the air flow a little bit

415
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,639
so what I tell people is y if you're

416
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,720
going to run a carbon filter on your

417
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,759
ventilation system you might want to opt

418
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,800
for a little bit higher of a a size you

419
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,639
know yeah I'd agree with that but if you

420
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,198
on a budget you want to just keep things

421
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,198
Bare Bones is there a particular brand

422
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:00,639
that you kind of recommend besides it I

423
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,359
mean AC Infinity you're looking at you

424
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,360
know over 100 bucks for an inline fan by

425
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,399
itself I know there are inline fans out

426
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,639
there that can be cheaper right you can

427
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,320
find something that's like 60 70 bucks

428
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,639
with just a variable speed controller

429
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,879
are there any brands that you can think

430
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,198
of that you would maybe recommend for

431
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,838
somebody who's trying to keep it under a

432
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:20,799
budget um I mean I would actually maybe

433
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,800
look at some of AC infiniti's cheaper

434
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,719
fans they do have some smaller fans that

435
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,319
are a little bit less expensive they do

436
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,920
have like I think a a a less powerful

437
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,959
line of fans I do really recommend

438
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:33,599
people look into getting a fan with that

439
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,638
speed controller though I do think it's

440
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,519
worth the extra investment you know

441
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,079
spend an extra 30 bucks to get that

442
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,799
controller in my opinion because it

443
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:42,000
really does make a big difference as far

444
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,479
as controlling the environment

445
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,278
controlling your humidity you know you

446
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,000
can go cheap on your fan but when you

447
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:50,120
think about it your environment really

448
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,278
plays a huge role in the success of your

449
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,839
grow um so I would urge people not to go

450
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,399
super cheap on their fan but yeah you

451
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,480
can get away with a cheaper fan if you

452
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,559
need to uh it's just all about getting

453
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,319
it dial in and focus on getting your

454
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,599
environmental parameters where you want

455
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:07,240
them right like does the fan achieve the

456
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,959
goals you want you know and for me the

457
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,959
AC Infinity fans with the speed

458
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,479
controller are kind of a no-brainer just

459
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,278
because the speed controller is so huge

460
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,399
as far as keeping the environment nice

461
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:20,439
getting your you know humidity in check

462
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,679
and um it's just worth spending a little

463
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,000
more for one of those in my opinion you

464
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,679
can go with a budget fan though for sure

465
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,480
um you know you just got to make sure

466
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:31,159
it's going to do the job yeah I

467
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,480
completely agree what about lighting if

468
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:35,240
somebody were to reach out to you and

469
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,600
say hey what's the best grow light

470
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,318
what's your answer for that I love that

471
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,600
question such a tricky question yeah

472
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:42,240
such a tricky question um I've used a

473
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,120
lot of lights over the years the two

474
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,360
companies I'm working with right now are

475
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,278
the two companies that I've I've been

476
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,639
having good experiences with lately are

477
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:53,240
hlg and AC Infinity again um hlg horror

478
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,278
culture Lighting Group makes really good

479
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,120
quality lights they can be a little bit

480
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:59,439
on the pricier side compared to some of

481
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,399
the stuff out there uh but I do think

482
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,319
it's worth it for the quality and the

483
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:04,759
customer service you get from them uh

484
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:06,519
they can also answer any questions from

485
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:09,160
you as far as like finding the right

486
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:12,038
light for your your space or how to best

487
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,519
array your lights or things like that um

488
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:16,759
I also really am a big fan of efficiency

489
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:19,000
uh I really hate wasting electricity in

490
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:21,519
my Gardens so getting lights with a high

491
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,240
efficiency rating uh which hlg always

492
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:26,000
has some of the best efficiency on the

493
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,880
market um I think that it pays off in

494
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,599
the long run you know your electric bill

495
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,360
being a little lower every month you

496
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,759
know makes up for the light costing a

497
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,399
little more up front uh I've also had

498
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,079
great experiences though with the AC

499
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,320
Infinity Lights I've got one of their

500
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:41,918
lights in my 2x two tent here in the

501
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:43,599
office with me and it does a great job I

502
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,400
also really like it's got a built-in

503
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,159
dimmer right on the top of the light

504
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,240
that's really easy to just dim it up and

505
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,759
down super quick just tap that button uh

506
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,480
if you don't need as much light or if

507
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:55,400
you are worried about heat you can also

508
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,960
dim it down uh I also really like I

509
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,960
believe their lights are ip65 rated or

510
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,000
ip64 rated I can't remember which one

511
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,720
but they are water resistant so you

512
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,919
don't have to worry about accidentally

513
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,798
spraying them if you're doing like a

514
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,720
full year spray in your tent or anything

515
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:11,679
like that you can just rinse them off so

516
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,600
um to me that's a really good feature to

517
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,159
have so I've had great experiences with

518
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,319
both companies I've tried a lot of other

519
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:19,240
lights and they're good too so I tell

520
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:20,918
people you know lighting an environment

521
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,359
is a great place to invest in your

522
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:24,000
garden you know there's places to go

523
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:25,798
cheap and then there's places to invest

524
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,519
is how I like to think of it and

525
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:29,038
lighting and environment are two places

526
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:31,480
where it's worse spending a little extra

527
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,000
money to get efficiency quality and get

528
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,480
the kind of you know performance you

529
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,798
need gotcha yeah I get asked about

530
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,038
lighting every every day there's there's

531
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:42,158
somebody in my DMs asking about lighting

532
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:44,480
and uh lighting is something that I've

533
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:45,840
dug deeper into over the years those

534
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,120
folks have been following me for many

535
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,359
years I used to do par testing on lights

536
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:52,439
I spent a year doing that and so I've

537
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:54,240
had my hands on over 50 grow lights

538
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,919
where I'm testing them learning about

539
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,200
them so on and so forth I've actually

540
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,080
gotten to a point where I've gotten the

541
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,200
question so so often that every year now

542
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:05,439
I do the research on all the lights and

543
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,000
put together a list of the best LED grow

544
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,080
lights of that year and I actually list

545
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,279
them on my website I have five different

546
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:16,918
articles for the different size grow

547
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:21,279
spaces common grow spaces twox two 2x4

548
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:22,480
3x3 4x4 and 5x5 and so I I just refer

549
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:25,960
people over to those lists it's

550
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,759
basically 10 lights per size grow bace

551
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,720
and uh one thing I do want to mention I

552
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,519
know I'm going to get some uh criticism

553
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,880
for this is I feel like we're at the

554
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,839
point where you can get the job done and

555
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,480
get optimal growth for a decent price

556
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:39,480
like there's so many what am I what am I

557
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,919
trying to get I'm trying to get at

558
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,159
there's a lot of overpriced lights on

559
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:46,159
the market and so I feel like for the

560
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:49,640
size growth space you're working in set

561
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:51,120
yourself for a budget for that size for

562
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,720
example I don't think you should spend

563
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:56,079
any more than $200 on a 2x2 grow space

564
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,120
for 2x4 no more than

565
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:02,678
$420 should you spend for 3x three grow

566
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:05,519
bace no more than $500 for a 4x4 grow

567
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:08,280
bace no more than $800 and then for a

568
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,960
5x5 grow Bas no more than $1,000 from

569
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:12,759
all the research I've ever done I find

570
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,880
tons of grow lights that get the job

571
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:17,519
done you get the good amount of of par

572
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,159
being admitted from those grow lights

573
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,558
for prices under those those dollar

574
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,000
amounts there so that's my

575
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:26,359
recommendation there are tons of good

576
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,720
lights out there that fall above that

577
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,439
and I'm not taking anything away from

578
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,640
those companies whatso ever you I want

579
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,320
to make that clear there are a lot of

580
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,038
good grow lights out there that are are

581
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:35,439
more expensive than that but you can

582
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:37,480
definitely get away with spending less

583
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,720
than those numbers for those size grow

584
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,679
spaces if you search yeah I totally

585
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,440
agree I totally agree and I think you

586
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,080
you're spot on with your numbers there I

587
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,759
think you're like right in the ballpark

588
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:49,720
about how much about people should spend

589
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,400
um the only thing I'll add to that is in

590
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,038
some cases it might be worth looking at

591
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,400
the efficiency and seeing like oh if

592
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,000
this one light's going to be a little

593
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,720
bit more efficient than the other one

594
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,640
meaning it's going to use you know less

595
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,880
watts to give you the the same amount of

596
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,640
power maybe spend a little bit more on

597
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,400
it because the longer you use it the

598
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,840
more that'll make sense over time right

599
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,000
because if your electric bills a little

600
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:10,319
cheaper every month that'll help pay for

601
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,400
that difference between you know a

602
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:15,038
cheaper light and a more expensive light

603
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,559
so um I always try to look at efficiency

604
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,000
the other thing I really like to look at

605
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:19,639
when I'm looking at lights is how well

606
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,679
is it going to cover your space right

607
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,600
like you mentioned picking the right

608
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,519
light for whatever size of tent or

609
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,798
whatever size of setup you're going and

610
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,759
make sure you get a light that's going

611
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,639
to you know give you a full spread over

612
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:32,679
that full area make sure you can use all

613
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,960
your expensive grow tent real estate

614
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:37,640
right so um yeah but I think you're spot

615
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,079
on with your numbers there and I'll say

616
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:43,159
too like I tend to like more higher end

617
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:45,000
lights but you can grow with you know

618
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:46,960
much lower end much cheaper light and

619
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,919
still have a great time still have great

620
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,640
success um you know some people get

621
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,000
super hardcore and nerdy about their

622
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,640
lights and want the most efficient most

623
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,240
powerful everything you know and I'm not

624
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,000
that guy you know I'm not that guy I

625
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,720
like to have really nice lights I like

626
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,278
quality stuff I love that the AC andin

627
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,679
lights are water resistant I think

628
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:06,599
that's a really good feature to have in

629
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,519
the grow um but yeah you can have

630
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:10,519
success with all kinds of Lights being

631
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:12,400
high budget lights lowbudget lights just

632
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:14,960
make sure you've got the power and the

633
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,480
coverage you need and you know after

634
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,278
that I say look at efficiency you know

635
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,960
try to make sure you're getting a decent

636
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:21,519
efficiency for your money because that's

637
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,159
going to impact the running cost of your

638
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:24,918
grow right you always have your startup

639
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:26,278
cost of buying your light but then you

640
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:28,278
also have the cost of what's this going

641
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:30,640
to cost me every month that I keep this

642
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:32,839
light on you know so keep that in mind

643
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,400
too when you're shopping is advice I

644
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:36,798
always like to share with people so

645
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,440
efficiency translated is micro moles per

646
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,319
Jewel right that's that's the number a

647
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,558
lot of people look at what's a good

648
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,000
number that people should go after these

649
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:45,678
days like the minimum number I should

650
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,359
say I know three four years ago was like

651
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,400
2.0 microl more Jewel or higher is a

652
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:53,918
good efficiency not anymore right now

653
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,278
it's what more like 2.5 is or higher or

654
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,000
what do you think it seems like it's

655
00:22:55,278 --> 00:23:00,440
always going up right but yeah I would

656
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,240
say you definitely want over too um I'd

657
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,798
say that's like a good place to start

658
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,919
and then from there just start comparing

659
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,960
prices of like okay if I spend this much

660
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:10,360
more on a light how much more efficiency

661
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,759
is that going to buy me you know is that

662
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:14,639
going to get me to 2.5 or whatever is

663
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:16,240
that going to you know and if it's not

664
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,679
you can you can actually do the math if

665
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,880
you really want to and figure out you

666
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,919
know how much is this light going to

667
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,480
cost me each month you can do that for

668
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:25,278
each light if you want and really break

669
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,640
it down um but yeah I'd say you know

670
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:29,480
anything above two is going to get you

671
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,080
in the ballpark where you want to be if

672
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,759
you can get higher than that great you

673
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,439
know if you can get way higher than that

674
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:36,359
that's great too it just depends on how

675
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,440
much you're willing to spend because

676
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:40,798
oftentimes efficiency comes with that

677
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,600
higher price tag right and I think both

678
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:46,158
hlg and AC Infinity are right in that

679
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,918
ballpark and they do it at a pretty good

680
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,278
price so that's why I tend to stick with

681
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,120
those brands or that's why I often

682
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:53,440
recommend those Brands to people but

683
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,199
there are lots of other brands too and

684
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,480
um just take a peek at that efficiency

685
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,240
and then maybe look at a couple other

686
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,558
lights too and see like am I is this

687
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,679
really really efficient compared to what

688
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:03,119
else is out there at the time because it

689
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,600
does seem like efficiency numbers are

690
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,719
changing all the time and it's a little

691
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:09,359
hard to keep up with sometimes but I

692
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,400
think we aren't approaching slowly the

693
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:14,959
theoretical maximum efficiency of LEDs

694
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,440
but um you know I'd say something above

695
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,919
two for sure so if somebody's looking at

696
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,679
two different grill lights and they're

697
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:23,559
stuck between these two one of them is

698
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:26,519
at 2.5 micro moles per Jewel and the

699
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:28,158
other one's at 2.7 micro moles per Jewel

700
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:31,918
and the one that's at 2.7 micro moles

701
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:34,080
per je is $200 more than the one that's

702
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:37,840
2.5 micro per je is it worth it for them

703
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:40,480
to spend that $200 more in order to get

704
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:42,759
that little bit more efficient fixture

705
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,399
um that's a great question and again I'd

706
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:46,359
have to do the math on that to really

707
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:48,000
give you like the numbers but the way I

708
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,798
think of it too is the longer you plan

709
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,038
on using that light the more the

710
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:53,839
efficiency is going to matter right and

711
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:55,599
efficiency also another thing I like to

712
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,918
keep in mind is efficiency also matters

713
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:00,038
a little more in a veg light it sounds a

714
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,559
little intuitive but if you're looking

715
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:04,038
at a light that you're going to run 18

716
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:05,960
hours a day you know you're running that

717
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:07,398
more hours per day getting better

718
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,720
efficiency out of that might be a little

719
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:10,879
bit more important so I'd say it's up to

720
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,519
you you know you have to really think

721
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,640
about your own budget as well you know

722
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:17,278
if you do you have that extra 200 bucks

723
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,720
to spend like maybe you maybe in that

724
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:20,038
case you make the upgrade you know go

725
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,399
for the more efficient light if you

726
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:22,839
don't then you know there's nothing

727
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:25,439
wrong with going with the slightly less

728
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:26,839
efficient light just remember that each

729
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,600
month when that electric bill comes

730
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:30,038
you're going to be paying a tiny bit bit

731
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:32,798
more because you went with that less

732
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:34,558
efficient light so you know do what you

733
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:36,079
can and and I always try to buy lights

734
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:37,759
that are going to last me like five

735
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:39,519
years or more you know that's always my

736
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,200
goal is I want I I don't like buying

737
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,519
tons of equipment and replacing stuff

738
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,399
all the time so I'd rather pay a little

739
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,599
bit more for a higher end light that I

740
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:48,519
know I'm going to be able to keep a

741
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:50,079
little bit longer but that's kind of

742
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:52,398
just my preference you know it's up to

743
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:54,720
you and how you run your garden and but

744
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:57,239
I think either way either of those

745
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,038
choices would be fine just depends on

746
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,839
what's best for you and maybe also how

747
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,599
much your electricity costs too I mean

748
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:03,918
some areas have really cheap electricity

749
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:05,879
some areas have really expensive

750
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,480
electricity so I live in Northern

751
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,240
California we've got pretty pricey

752
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,880
electricity so I tend to go for

753
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,399
efficiency whenever I can because that

754
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,840
means I can run more lights or run you

755
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:18,719
know lights more often or um you know

756
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,519
use my power for other things so yeah

757
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,159
just depends on your setup I guess that

758
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:26,119
makes sense let's move on to medium so

759
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,919
if a new grower were to reach out and

760
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:30,000
say should I do soil or should I do

761
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,880
Cocoa what's your answer to that it's a

762
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
great question and I tend to say you can

763
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,559
really do either but the most important

764
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,960
thing is to make sure you're picking a

765
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:40,798
system that works together you know I

766
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,840
always think of nutrition and plant

767
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:45,558
media as being you know equal Hales to

768
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:46,839
the same thing right you got to think

769
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:47,918
about your medium but you also got to

770
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,918
think about what kind of nutrients

771
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,759
you're going to be using so I like to

772
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,240
use living soil in my grow that's where

773
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,079
I'm putting you know all the nutrients

774
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,399
in the soil and working on building the

775
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:00,678
soil as a battery to kind of power the

776
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:03,038
plant throughout the growth so that's

777
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:05,240
the style I really like doing uh I like

778
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,839
that it's organic I like that I only

779
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,440
have to water my soil I don't have to

780
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:11,720
worry about mixing up nutrients and

781
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,200
stuff like that um but then again some

782
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,759
people like mixing up nutrients some

783
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,360
people like the control that bottle

784
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,278
nutrients give them and like the

785
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,199
flexibility that bottle nutrients give

786
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:22,960
them and if that sounds more like your

787
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,600
style maybe Coco is a way to go I mean

788
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,038
I've done some great grows with cocoa

789
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:28,918
I've done some great grows with bag soil

790
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:31,119
and liquid nutrients and I've done some

791
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:32,399
great growths with living soil and dry

792
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:35,759
amendments you know it just kind of

793
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:38,278
depends on what style kind of speaks to

794
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,480
you uh I like to say that with living

795
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:41,839
soil you do a lot of the work upfront

796
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,759
right you spend a lot of time building

797
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:45,558
your soil prepping your soil making sure

798
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:48,079
the soil's nice and balanc make sure

799
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:49,759
you've got lots of life in there uh

800
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,199
maybe getting some Mulch and some cover

801
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,480
crop you know you're doing a lot of prep

802
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,399
work to get your soil ready but then

803
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,599
once the growth started all I really

804
00:27:55,398 --> 00:27:59,518
have to do is water it you know uh the

805
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:00,839
soil's all the food in it I don't really

806
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,640
have to think about Nutrition a whole

807
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:05,158
lot for the rest of the grow I'm able to

808
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,600
just kind of you know use the irrigation

809
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:10,840
system or hand water and it makes things

810
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:12,439
really simple that way um however if I

811
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:14,918
made a make a mistake or if I screw

812
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,880
something up you know I've maybe painted

813
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:20,038
myself into a corner by using living

814
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,600
soil so uh I I like both Styles I think

815
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:23,919
for new Growers um it really depends on

816
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:26,519
what speaks to you cuz I really think

817
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,759
both systems can work well both either a

818
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:30,759
a cocoa based system where you're

819
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:32,278
feeding liquid nutrients all the time uh

820
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:34,398
works really well for people if you

821
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:36,599
maybe have uh space limitations you

822
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:39,079
don't have room for a huge pile of soil

823
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:40,918
at your house um you know you don't want

824
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:42,720
to be mixing up dirt in your house

825
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,679
anywhere then maybe Coco is for you or

826
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,919
maybe if you live in an apartment or

827
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:49,240
like a trailer or something you know in

828
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:51,840
those cases uh liquid nutrients I think

829
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,880
tend to work out better for people but

830
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:56,558
um again I really think it's up to you

831
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,320
uh it just is a preference thing you

832
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:59,678
know and i' like I said I've done great

833
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,759
with cocoa and bottled nutrients I've

834
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,000
done great grows with living soil um I

835
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:05,919
think it's just about picking what

836
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,398
speaks to you as a grower you know I

837
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,240
think Different Different Strokes for

838
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:11,639
different folks different um you know

839
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,759
people are going to be drawn to

840
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,278
different styles of doing things and

841
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,038
I've always been drawn to the living

842
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:19,759
soil way of doing things cuz I love

843
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:22,158
biology I love you know microbes and

844
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,599
nature doing its thing so I like to

845
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,039
pretend I'm a forest ranger in my grow

846
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:29,079
um more than like a a

847
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:30,640
chemist you know some people like being

848
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:31,798
a chemist though some people like mixing

849
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,519
all the different chemicals like

850
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:34,960
checking the pH like checking all their

851
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,038
numbers and all that and like having

852
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,519
that degree of control I'm kind of more

853
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:41,359
of a let's build an ecosystem style of

854
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:44,200
grower you know that's how I like to do

855
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:45,918
things so um I would say if you're a new

856
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,440
grower look at both approaches and see

857
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,080
what speaks to you you know do you think

858
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,600
you want the control of a bottle

859
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,199
nutrient grow with Coco where you're

860
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:54,398
able to dial things in really

861
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,640
specifically and you have the control

862
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,398
but that also means you're the one in

863
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,720
charge right you're the one who's got to

864
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,319
balance everything you're the one who's

865
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,759
got to make sure you're following a feed

866
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:05,278
chart or following a feed plan um

867
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,480
whereas living soil I feel like you kind

868
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:09,679
of follow a recipe at the beginning you

869
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,319
set it up and then it's kind of nature

870
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,480
does a lot of the work for you from then

871
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:15,240
on out so yeah again it just depends on

872
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,599
your approach and what kind of speaks to

873
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,319
you as a grower but for me living soil

874
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:21,079
has been the way for a while I'm a big

875
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:24,278
fan of soil and just love getting my

876
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:26,519
hands dirty so um but yeah all depends

877
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:29,079
on what what speaks to you yeah I don't

878
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:31,000
have much to add to that one except for

879
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:34,000
there is one thing to keep in mind I

880
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,599
feel like with soil it holds on to like

881
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,200
the water and nutrients a little bit

882
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:40,759
better than cocoa for example so one

883
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,880
thing I noticed as I was going back and

884
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:44,480
forth between soil and cocoa is you have

885
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,039
to water a little bit more often right

886
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,278
when you're in Cocoa cuz the more area

887
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:49,839
of a medium doesn't hold water as well a

888
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:52,398
lot of people say you can't overwater

889
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:54,480
cocoa but I found that to be false you

890
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:56,359
could totally overwater cocoa you know

891
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,079
I've seen plants where clearly there was

892
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:59,839
a lack of oxygen in the root Zone

893
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:01,519
because I was overwatering them but it

894
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:04,319
is a little bit more difficult to

895
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:06,399
overwater Coco I guess you could say of

896
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,119
course the plant size is g to matter the

897
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:10,479
size of the container is going to matter

898
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:11,678
but generally speaking cocoa holds a

899
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,599
little bit less you're going to have to

900
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,798
water it more often so something to keep

901
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:17,119
in mind if you're looking to be a little

902
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:18,759
more hands off I know we're going to get

903
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,599
into Auto watering systems here in a

904
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:22,119
little bit but uh yeah just as far as

905
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:23,798
hand watering could be a little bit more

906
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:25,798
labor if you're getting in there a

907
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:27,480
little bit more often to to water cocoa

908
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:30,000
so you got add that one in how about

909
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:33,278
pots size and type you know they could

910
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,038
choose either plastic or Fabric or

911
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:38,000
airpots are out there right size

912
00:31:36,038 --> 00:31:39,720
container is a common question you know

913
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,759
what SI should I start in should I

914
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,440
transplant or not what should be my

915
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,960
final container what do you typically

916
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,558
recommend for pot size yeah so again I

917
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,360
like to think of nutrition and medium

918
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:52,000
and pots and all that stuff kind of as a

919
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:53,918
system right so it depends on what

920
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,839
system you're going with if I'm going

921
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,559
with a cocoa grow and I'm using liquid

922
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,000
nutrients smaller pots are possible

923
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,240
uh you can get away with much smaller

924
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,200
pots of that style of grow and I'll say

925
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,440
also with Coco as you were saying you

926
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,038
kind of are feeding every time you water

927
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,679
typically and you're also um watering a

928
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:14,519
bit more often so in those cases I think

929
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:16,759
air pruning pots so something like a

930
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:18,638
fabric pot that helps kind of prune the

931
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:21,440
sides it'll actually keep the plant from

932
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:24,319
spiraling its roots um can be really

933
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,519
helpful uh for living soil though I

934
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,519
really think big pots are the way to go

935
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:30,759
you really uh the way I always think of

936
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:32,960
it is with living soil your soil is the

937
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:34,440
battery right so if you want a battery

938
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,240
that's going to last you from the start

939
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,798
of your grow all the way to your end of

940
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,960
the grow you're going to need a pretty

941
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:43,359
big battery to hold all that nutrition

942
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,399
in it um so for living soil I typically

943
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:47,479
tell people you want your final pot the

944
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:50,038
pot you go into flower with to be at

945
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,960
least 10 gallons probably more like 15

946
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:56,038
Gallons if you can I love a good 15 gon

947
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,519
pot uh I also love beds and much bigger

948
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:00,960
pots too but uh for Coco I think you've

949
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,278
got a lot more wiggle room you can go a

950
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,319
lot smaller Coco I definitely like the

951
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:07,558
air pruning pots like a fabric pot or

952
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:09,918
one of those Arrow pots um can be

953
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:11,519
beneficial uh because they dry out the

954
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,840
media a little bit faster which means

955
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,120
you get to water a little bit sooner

956
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:16,398
which means you get to feed a little bit

957
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:18,558
more again uh whereas living soil you

958
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:20,119
really want the St soil to stay moist

959
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:23,079
pretty much all the time you want that

960
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:24,678
soil to keep alive you've got microbes

961
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:26,278
in that soil that are helping break down

962
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:28,759
all the nutrients and make them plant

963
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:31,119
available and if you let that soil dry

964
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:33,200
out too much the microbes kind of go

965
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:35,319
dormant and that makes nutrition much

966
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,639
less available and the whole kind of

967
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:40,398
biological system kind of starts to shut

968
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:42,839
down when things get too dry so keeping

969
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:44,918
soil a little bit moisture uh helps a

970
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:47,558
lot and having bigger pots helps you do

971
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:49,000
that you know if you have a small pot uh

972
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:50,759
it's going to dry out a lot faster

973
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,038
especially if you got a little tiny pot

974
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:56,000
with a big old plant in it so um but I

975
00:33:54,038 --> 00:33:58,240
always in both grow Styles tend to push

976
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,638
people into going with larger pots if

977
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,960
you can I do think the more Roots more

978
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:05,319
fruits so to speak and uh also just I

979
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,519
think plants are healthier when they've

980
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:10,319
got a good size root system supporting

981
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,480
them you know if you grow a little tiny

982
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,639
pot this big but you grow a big giant

983
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,079
plant in it you're really asking a lot

984
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,358
of those roots you're really pushing

985
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,079
them hard and they're going to have to

986
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:20,719
work really hard to make sure that

987
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:22,200
plant's getting enough water and

988
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,959
nutrition and all that other stuff

989
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:26,398
whereas when you've got a good siiz pot

990
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,720
it's a little bit you got a little more

991
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,239
wiggle room you got a little bit more

992
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,719
more of a buffer if case you make a

993
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:32,638
mistake with your feeding or in case you

994
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,519
make a mistake with your watering things

995
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,320
are aren't going to you know go bad on

996
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:39,119
you like that so um I always try to push

997
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,079
people towards larger pots and for me in

998
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,679
living soil I really like at least 10

999
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,839
gallons maybe even 15 if you can uh or

1000
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,358
bigger you know I've grown some great

1001
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:48,679
plants in 25 gallons too but I

1002
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:51,398
understand not everybody has the space

1003
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:53,639
for Gigantic pots but if you can I

1004
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:56,239
really like them I know there's quite a

1005
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:58,519
few people who will do living soil but

1006
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,559
they'll do the fabric pots

1007
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:01,880
and uh you know the plant will grow be

1008
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:03,440
fine but kind of what you mentioned

1009
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,200
earlier the medium needs to stay moisted

1010
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,280
all times and when you have these fabric

1011
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:09,078
pots they actually dry out from all

1012
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,240
different angles which isn't natural

1013
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:14,560
Grassroots fabric pots they make a

1014
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:16,000
fabric pot with a liner in the side so

1015
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:18,519
uh you know it's fabric up top then it's

1016
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,639
a liner most of the way down and on the

1017
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:23,159
very bottom I want to say it's like 2 in

1018
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,960
from the bottom it's it's fabric again

1019
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:27,279
um so that helps keep the moisture in on

1020
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,199
all the sides so I know a lot of people

1021
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,440
that are growing with Organics living

1022
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:34,559
soil are going towards those pots or

1023
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,358
plastic pots you know versus just the

1024
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,199
straight up fabric pots so I fig I'd

1025
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:40,000
mention that one yeah that's a really

1026
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:42,000
great thing to bring up and I love those

1027
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,880
pots by the way those grassroot fabric

1028
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,119
pots with the liner inside of them work

1029
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,960
outstanding and I also I actually use in

1030
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:50,400
my bigger grow I have their beds they

1031
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,800
make beds with the same liner in them

1032
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,639
and I have a two 3x3 beds in my bigger

1033
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,119
grow with the living soil liner on them

1034
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,199
and it does such a good job of keeping

1035
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:00,039
the moisture in because like you were

1036
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:01,719
saying you you want the air pruning at

1037
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:03,039
the bottom right you want things to

1038
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:04,439
start drying out at the bottom and you

1039
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:06,279
want there to be drainage at the bottom

1040
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,760
of your pot or the bottom of your bed

1041
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,519
but you don't want those sides and you

1042
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,280
don't want the top drying out super fast

1043
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:12,800
with living soil because that starts to

1044
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,040
shut the soil down starts making the

1045
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,079
microbes all go to sleep so um yeah I

1046
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:19,159
love those those are a great

1047
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:21,599
recommendation how about environment

1048
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:24,118
monitors when you're growing indoors you

1049
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,280
temperature humidity lot people tracking

1050
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:29,280
VPD now are there any monitors in the

1051
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,519
market that you generally

1052
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,960
recommend uh I've been using the pulse

1053
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:37,119
monitors for many years I really like

1054
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,880
their product um it monitors temperature

1055
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,119
humidity um I think their newer monitor

1056
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,838
also does co2 and has a built-in light

1057
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:45,760
meter which is really cool I haven't had

1058
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:47,078
a chance to play with that one yet but

1059
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,040
the older ones that I have I have a

1060
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,200
couple of them around my grow and being

1061
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:53,519
able to track and log the environments

1062
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,000
really helpful I also love it's got a

1063
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:56,599
feature where it will alert you if

1064
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,199
there's a problem you can set up your

1065
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:01,559
parameters and that has saved my butt a

1066
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:04,598
number of times from some from some

1067
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:07,599
problems you know I had a a dehumidifier

1068
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:08,720
malfunction you know and I would never

1069
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,838
have known I would have come back

1070
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:12,679
several days later and my plants would

1071
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:14,318
have been real unhappy except I have

1072
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:16,318
this wonderful pulse monitor that sent

1073
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:17,800
me an email saying hey something looks a

1074
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:20,119
little bit off in this room you should

1075
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,200
come check it out so I really like the

1076
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:24,079
pulse monitors they're great they are a

1077
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:25,598
little bit on the expensive side but if

1078
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,119
you're a serious grower and if you're

1079
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,640
like going to be doing it for a while I

1080
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,519
think it's worth the investment to pick

1081
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:33,118
one up um I also like the AC Infinity

1082
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:36,119
controllers I was talking about earlier

1083
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,160
the controllers built into their fans

1084
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:40,559
now you can get one that's Bluetooth

1085
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:43,358
enabled or Wi-Fi enabled and it has some

1086
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,960
monitoring too um it actually logs your

1087
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:47,039
temperatures logs your humidity and you

1088
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,318
can log into the app and actually see

1089
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,880
all that and having the ability to see

1090
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:52,759
how your temperatures and humidity

1091
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,519
change throughout the day or throughout

1092
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,040
the light cycle I think is really

1093
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:58,719
valuable um you know I used to dial my

1094
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,159
grow in during the day but then I was

1095
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:02,480
like oh I wonder what's going on at

1096
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:04,078
night you know I have no idea and you

1097
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,039
know having the pulse Monitor and having

1098
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,800
the AC Infinity tense in there actually

1099
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:09,679
lets me look at that lets me see you

1100
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,960
know when my lights are off at 4 in the

1101
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,719
morning what's going on in my grow uh

1102
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,318
cuz you know the plants it's important

1103
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:18,078
to the plants all the time with your

1104
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:20,679
their environments like you know not

1105
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,359
just when you happen to be in there so

1106
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:25,519
having a a tool that logs and also a

1107
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:27,880
tool that alerts you both can be really

1108
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:29,199
helpful um again I I understand the

1109
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,480
pulse meters are a little bit more on

1110
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:32,679
the expensive side but if you're serious

1111
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,039
about growing and you know if you're

1112
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:35,759
setting up an environment that you're

1113
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:37,039
trying to really keep dialed in I think

1114
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,599
they're worth the investment I think

1115
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:41,079
it's a good idea to you know track that

1116
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,800
stuff and and it it's helped me be a

1117
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,800
better grower to be honest I mean being

1118
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,720
able to track my settings and being able

1119
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,359
to notice things like oh man my humidity

1120
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:51,118
is way out of whack at night time you

1121
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:53,920
know like it it helps me make better

1122
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,079
decisions in my grow and um yeah so I'd

1123
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,639
say they're they're definitely a tool I

1124
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:58,760
would recommend especially if they're in

1125
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,960
your budget yeah it's great being able

1126
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,359
to see the line graph like you mentioned

1127
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,280
with the history be able to see the

1128
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:06,679
temperature humidity VPD all on a line

1129
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,440
graph so you can see the history what it

1130
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:09,838
look like for the past hour what did it

1131
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,318
look like for the past day what did it

1132
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:12,599
look like for the past week that

1133
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:13,838
functionality with AC Infinity

1134
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:16,039
controller is awesome that's what I'm

1135
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:18,719
using right now also similar to that is

1136
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:21,199
the sensor push monitor I used for like

1137
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:22,279
past 5 years and now with the AC

1138
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:24,838
Infinity one I don't even know if I'm

1139
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,839
going to use the sensor push one anymore

1140
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:29,000
because AC Infinity now has it built

1141
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:30,880
into the control same style line graph

1142
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
and everything so um that was a really

1143
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,680
good one I think the monitor for sensor

1144
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,318
push was like 50 bucks then for the

1145
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:39,679
Wi-Fi Gateway was 100 bucks so 150 bucks

1146
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:42,239
for that I think the pulse monitor that

1147
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:44,519
you mentioned the pulse one is 200 bucks

1148
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:46,318
I believe unless they Chang the price

1149
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:49,559
they have the pulse Pro is the one with

1150
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:51,880
the par meter built in that's 500 bucks

1151
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:54,239
but you know it's kind of getting up

1152
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,640
there but it does actually CO2 as well

1153
00:39:54,239 --> 00:40:00,318
right CO2 monitor par meter so when you

1154
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:01,759
look to see what that has um it could

1155
00:40:00,318 --> 00:40:03,960
definitely be beneficial to spend that

1156
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,560
extra money if you're looking to monitor

1157
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,199
your CO2 there's not many many CO2

1158
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:10,519
monitors on the market right now I

1159
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:12,519
believe AC Infinity is working on one I

1160
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:13,559
hope they're working on one um you know

1161
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:16,280
it seems like they're working on

1162
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:17,519
everything these days and they're uh and

1163
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,280
they're putting on some really high

1164
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:21,159
quality products I think it's only a

1165
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,640
matter of time before they're they're

1166
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:25,239
doing CO2 equipment yeah we spoke about

1167
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:27,039
about their fan earlier and that's one

1168
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:29,358
of the other things I think adds value

1169
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:31,279
to right like you're paying you know a

1170
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:33,199
pretty decent price for a fan and then

1171
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,839
the fact that you're getting a fan plus

1172
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:37,358
environmental Controller Plus

1173
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:39,679
environmental monitor all for that you

1174
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:41,639
know one price it makes the AC Infinity

1175
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,279
fan kind of a no-brainer in my mind as

1176
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,960
far as the value of it because you're

1177
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,440
getting you know three things in one you

1178
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,199
know for the the price of a fan no

1179
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,960
you're absolutely right yeah yeah that's

1180
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:53,439
a really good call out with the

1181
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,159
environmental monitors as long as you're

1182
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,800
getting some sort of notification that's

1183
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:59,239
helpful right so when a sensor push you

1184
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,800
can set notifications to if it reaches a

1185
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:02,279
certain temperature you get alerted on

1186
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,839
your smartphone or it goes below a

1187
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,680
certain temperature same thing with

1188
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:08,119
humidity I know the pulse monitor does

1189
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:09,399
that AC Infinity I'm not sure if they I

1190
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:11,039
haven't played around with it too much

1191
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,720
yet if they give you some sort of phone

1192
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,279
alerts if the temperature goes too high

1193
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:17,039
I know the fan will kick on and stuff

1194
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,480
like that but not sure if alerts will

1195
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:20,400
actually come to your smartphone when it

1196
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,800
gets out of the ranges that you set but

1197
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,760
yeah uh definitely can be valuable to be

1198
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,800
alerted when things are out of control

1199
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,640
so that way you can go in and

1200
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,440
investigate and make adjustments as

1201
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:31,358
necessary or you can just have your

1202
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,639
environmental controller do it which is

1203
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:34,318
what we're going to talk about next

1204
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:37,759
environmental controllers so there's

1205
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:39,279
niwa there's trollmaster there's ink

1206
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,839
bird what are your experience with

1207
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,760
environmental controllers um I don't

1208
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:46,119
have a ton to be honest outside of the

1209
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,280
AC Infinity controller I've played a

1210
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:50,000
little bit with some of the smart plug

1211
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,599
based ones like the I think the ink

1212
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,119
Bird's a little bit of a smart plug but

1213
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,720
there's also like the uh Casa smart

1214
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:57,400
plugs and some of those other smart plug

1215
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:59,199
things that can be used to control

1216
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,440
things and work as environmental

1217
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:03,279
controllers as well and one of my big

1218
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,200
concerns about some of those controllers

1219
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,160
is when they're Wi-Fi based I've seen

1220
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:10,480
ones that if your Wi-Fi goes down they

1221
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:12,679
don't work properly anymore or they

1222
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,800
start doing strange things I had a a

1223
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:18,879
smart plug that when my Wi-Fi went out

1224
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,760
it would just turn everything on which

1225
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,640
wasn't really what I wanted you know so

1226
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,559
um I will say just like keep that in

1227
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:27,159
mind that can be kind of vulnerability

1228
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:29,480
with some of those Wi-Fi based system

1229
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:31,199
systems is if your Wi-Fi goes down how

1230
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,119
is it going to react you know what's it

1231
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:35,639
going to do and you want to understand

1232
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,480
that before you base your whole grow on

1233
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:40,960
something like that um but yeah I don't

1234
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,358
use a whole lot of like big system you

1235
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,358
know whole system environmental

1236
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:46,719
controllers but I think using the

1237
00:42:44,358 --> 00:42:48,318
built-in control options on things like

1238
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:50,759
your air air conditioner or your

1239
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:54,159
dehumidifier is usually kind of the way

1240
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,640
to go um as opposed to using some sort

1241
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:58,879
of smart device to control it for you I

1242
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:01,920
think Ty the built-in controllers built

1243
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,880
into most grow equipment tends to be a

1244
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,760
little bit more reliable um I do think

1245
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,960
those smart plugs and the niwa and some

1246
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,960
of those other things have uh good

1247
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:14,240
potential but you just have to make sure

1248
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,960
that you're not um you know going to run

1249
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:18,318
into a problem if your internet goes

1250
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,079
down or you know your power goes off and

1251
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:21,440
then comes back on what's it going to do

1252
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,119
is it going to remember the settings

1253
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,519
from before is it going to forget them

1254
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,680
and you're going to have to go reprogram

1255
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:29,599
everything you know um but and that's in

1256
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:32,279
my mind why I've for for just small

1257
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,838
grows I find that AC Infinity fan with

1258
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,440
the built-in controller to be just hard

1259
00:43:34,838 --> 00:43:39,440
to pass up because it's made growing in

1260
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,920
my office so much easier being able to

1261
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,200
have that environmental control where

1262
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,838
all I really do to control the

1263
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:48,159
environment in my smaller tents is keep

1264
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:49,880
my house at a regular temperature you

1265
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:52,519
know keep my house comfortable for me to

1266
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,599
be in and then I let the acen infinity

1267
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:56,880
fan controller work out the details you

1268
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:58,880
know I let it fine-tune everything else

1269
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,680
and I find as long as I keep my house

1270
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:06,358
you know between 60 and 80° or you know

1271
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:08,239
and keep humidity in a reasonable range

1272
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:11,838
the AC Infinity controller is able to

1273
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:14,279
dial my grow in pretty well um you know

1274
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:16,440
for my larger grow I'm using individual

1275
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,040
devices that aren't plugged into any

1276
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,838
kind of controller they're all just kind

1277
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:22,039
of set at their own parameters like I

1278
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:24,480
have a standalone dehi ifier a standle

1279
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:28,159
and air conditioner um and those are all

1280
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,559
using their own internal controllers

1281
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:31,199
um but yeah I think there's some value

1282
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:32,880
in some of those other controllers just

1283
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:34,598
be careful and and just be aware of the

1284
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,519
failure points of them you know be aware

1285
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:39,000
of if something goes wrong how is it

1286
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:41,239
going to behave I think one of the the

1287
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,079
big failure points with some of these

1288
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:45,000
controllers to keep in mind actually had

1289
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:46,240
the troll Master controller for a very

1290
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,159
short period of time and the only reason

1291
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:51,199
why I got rid of it is I plugged in my

1292
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:52,480
humidifier into there and uh you know

1293
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:55,159
you can plug in your humidifier

1294
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,519
dehumidifier heater air conditioner

1295
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:57,879
right that that's the point of these

1296
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:59,159
Environmental to controllers just to

1297
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,000
plug your equipment in there and then

1298
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:03,000
they'll turn on and off as necessary to

1299
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,280
control your environment one of the

1300
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,639
downsides is it doesn't actually control

1301
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,960
the function on and off right so it's

1302
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:12,118
going to turn the unit on but in order

1303
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,800
to actually start spinning out that

1304
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:15,838
humidification right the water vapor

1305
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,079
into the air it's got to press another

1306
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,318
button be turned on so the troll Master

1307
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,559
isn't able to do that so if you are

1308
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:23,119
going to get one of these environmental

1309
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:24,480
controllers make sure that the equipment

1310
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,599
that you already spent money on you know

1311
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,280
your humidifier dehumidifier air

1312
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:29,720
conditioner heater make sure those

1313
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:34,400
things are going to automatically turn

1314
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:37,118
on once power is given to them so just

1315
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,318
fig that that's a great Point that's a

1316
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,440
great Point yeah it was a pretty big

1317
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:41,759
downside I was really disappointed when

1318
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,240
I first got the troll master and

1319
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,400
realized that it wasn't going to work

1320
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:47,719
with my equipment so my heater air

1321
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,480
conditioner sometimes you need to

1322
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:51,318
increase the temperature a lot of people

1323
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,240
use it with the heater or you need to

1324
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:54,759
decrease right cuz it's too much heat so

1325
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:56,078
people are adding in some sort of air

1326
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,359
conditioning you talked to us about

1327
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:01,640
heater air conditioner is there any

1328
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:04,519
specific brands or equipment that you um

1329
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:06,239
recommend folks to get um yeah I'd say a

1330
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:07,639
lot of this depends too on the size of

1331
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:09,799
your grow you know if you're running a

1332
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:12,159
2X two tent probably shouldn't be

1333
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,920
looking at air conditioners or you know

1334
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:16,558
big heaters or anything like that CU

1335
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,159
it's not going to fit um so in in those

1336
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,119
cases if you're running a smaller tent

1337
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:22,199
or smaller environment I find it works

1338
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:24,760
best just to control the environment of

1339
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:26,960
the room the tents in right so for me in

1340
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,440
the office tents here I'm using my house

1341
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,358
AC I don't have a dehumidifier in here

1342
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,240
but I'm in Northern California so my

1343
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:37,440
humidity stays pretty good most of the

1344
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:39,479
time um in the bigger grow outside I use

1345
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,400
I have a frigid a dehumidifier that's

1346
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:44,838
worked really well for me for many years

1347
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,079
um and I have a mini split and that's

1348
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:48,679
one thing I was going to say as far as

1349
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,240
air conditioners go uh efficiency is

1350
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:51,480
another really big thing with air

1351
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:53,118
conditioners you can get the little

1352
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,719
portable ones the little ones with the

1353
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,519
hoses that come out of them and stuff

1354
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:59,480
like that and I've used those before and

1355
00:46:56,519 --> 00:47:02,480
they but man you lose so much efficiency

1356
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:06,280
they lose they use so much power just to

1357
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:09,199
do anything um and it really adds up on

1358
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:11,680
your bill quickly and you know a mini

1359
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:13,239
split is a really expensive option too

1360
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:14,919
you know getting a really nice mini

1361
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:17,118
split air conditioner can cost you

1362
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,519
several thousand dollars but if you're

1363
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,400
serious about growing and you've got a

1364
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:22,039
bigger grow environment or you know if

1365
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,240
you've got a couple of tents in one room

1366
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:26,358
or something getting a big mini split

1367
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:28,838
will save you money in the long term

1368
00:47:26,358 --> 00:47:31,358
because the efficiency is so much better

1369
00:47:28,838 --> 00:47:33,159
than you know a lot of those smaller air

1370
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:35,480
conditioners um you know if you have to

1371
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:39,039
you can use a window air conditioner or

1372
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:41,000
you know use what you can you know and

1373
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:42,599
it depends so much on your grow you know

1374
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,920
how serious you're going to have to get

1375
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:47,240
about things like air conditioning and

1376
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,838
dehumidification um but it's another one

1377
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:50,279
of those areas of your grow where I say

1378
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:52,599
it's worth investing a little bit more

1379
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,280
money to do it right it's worth getting

1380
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:56,880
quality stuff it's worth getting more

1381
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,559
efficient stuff because man running a

1382
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,318
really inefficient air conditioner will

1383
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:04,160
cost you a ton of money and you'll

1384
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:05,838
you'll quickly regret it you know it's

1385
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:07,199
really easy if if you live somewhere

1386
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:09,078
really hot and you start running one of

1387
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:11,759
those little portable AC units you know

1388
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:13,800
all day every day be prepared for a big

1389
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,280
old power bill at the end of the month

1390
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,960
um you know so for me growing in the

1391
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:21,240
house here in the small tents I've got a

1392
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:23,039
2X two and a 2x4 in this room I'm able

1393
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:24,799
to keep this room at a pretty decent

1394
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,318
temperature just kind of using my home

1395
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,559
climate control using my home

1396
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:33,679
ventilation system um works pretty well

1397
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:37,519
so um there can be other problems with

1398
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:38,598
you know using bigger um grows you know

1399
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:39,880
at that point you're going to want to

1400
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:42,480
start looking into something a little

1401
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:45,800
bit more expensive but yeah it just

1402
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:48,880
depends so much on your setup um but

1403
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:51,920
yeah I I'm a big fan of uh frigid a for

1404
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,720
a lot of equipment um I also like

1405
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,680
Fujitsu if you're going for a mini split

1406
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:57,598
Fujitsu makes excellent Mini Splits but

1407
00:48:55,679 --> 00:49:00,039
they are expensive

1408
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,359
I think I spent something like $3,000

1409
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:04,480
for my

1410
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:06,598
18K Mini Split unit but the good thing

1411
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,000
about that though is it's was a the most

1412
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:12,798
efficient unit on the market at the time

1413
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,318
and it also um you know has a tenure

1414
00:49:12,798 --> 00:49:16,920
warranty that goes with it so it hurt a

1415
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:18,920
little bit to pull up my wallet and

1416
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,440
smack down that three grand to buy it

1417
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,920
but now I know I'm set for the next 10

1418
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,079
years you know I've got a good air

1419
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,079
conditioner that's going to last me a

1420
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,640
long time and my monthly bills aren't

1421
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:31,039
going to be huge huge because I'm using

1422
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:33,440
a really high efficiency unit so

1423
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:34,719
um yeah I mean it just depends so much

1424
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,519
on your setup you know as soon as you

1425
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:38,719
start getting into bigger grows bigger

1426
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:41,280
tents you know running a lot of lights

1427
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:43,039
you're probably looking at a mini split

1428
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,839
um if you're running smaller tents I

1429
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:46,838
would say try to do what you can with

1430
00:49:44,838 --> 00:49:48,159
just your home air conditioning system

1431
00:49:46,838 --> 00:49:49,558
you know see what you can do with just

1432
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:50,960
trying to keep your house or keep the

1433
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:52,760
room your tents in at a decent

1434
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,639
temperature and then use something like

1435
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,200
the AC Infinity controller or another

1436
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:58,480
environmental controller to really work

1437
00:49:56,199 --> 00:50:00,679
out the details you know to fine-tune

1438
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,000
everything but I find with grow tents if

1439
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:04,719
you can get to the to the ballpark you

1440
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,400
know environment wise you can use a

1441
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:08,639
controller to kind of get you the last

1442
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,400
little mile yeah I'm able to get away

1443
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,440
with using the central air conditioning

1444
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,880
of my house as well and actually past

1445
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,039
couple years I've been successful not

1446
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:18,880
growing during the summer months July

1447
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:20,279
and August in particular I plan my grow

1448
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,119
you know plan it so I can have enough

1449
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,960
Harvest to last me so I don't have to

1450
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:26,000
grow in those couple months can

1451
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,838
drastically bring down the energy bill I

1452
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,159
did use a portable air conditioner at

1453
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,920
one point and like you had mentioned

1454
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:34,358
like once you get that electricity bill

1455
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,200
it just it's skyrockets it's crazy the

1456
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:38,279
amount of energy those things consume

1457
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:40,480
it's a lot more friendlier on your

1458
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,798
wallet if you're using the air

1459
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,920
conditioning in your home at least

1460
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:46,318
that's been it for my experience but

1461
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,400
when it comes to heating I have actually

1462
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:51,318
been pretty successful using a tower

1463
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:54,440
heater like you mentioned controlling

1464
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:56,639
the temperature and humidity in your

1465
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:59,039
lung room or the room that you're grow

1466
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:01,159
tent is in is definitely beneficial and

1467
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:02,719
that's typically what I do so I have my

1468
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:04,118
tower heat are there but sometimes I

1469
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:05,239
also have a tower heater I have a couple

1470
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:07,318
of them sometimes I'll actually have one

1471
00:51:05,239 --> 00:51:10,239
in the grow tent as well because when

1472
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:11,759
the lights turn off winter time

1473
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:14,159
temperature does drop quite a bit and

1474
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:18,359
it's it can certainly drop to the high

1475
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:20,199
50s you know low 60s where I live so uh

1476
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:22,039
so having a tower heater just kick on

1477
00:51:20,199 --> 00:51:23,519
for a short period of time in order to

1478
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:25,159
reach that set point that's on the

1479
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,079
actual heater has definitely been

1480
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:29,598
beneficial and those Tower they're not

1481
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:32,039
that expensive you know 50 bucks 75

1482
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:33,920
bucks it does consume a lot of Watts but

1483
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:35,719
they're not on for you know extended

1484
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,119
period of time so you're not going to

1485
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:39,480
see a massive change in your electricity

1486
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:41,599
bill unless you're running it all day

1487
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,119
long right yeah well and with heaters

1488
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,760
too I really like I I use in the past

1489
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:48,160
I've used uh those like radiator style

1490
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,799
heaters where it actually looks like a

1491
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:52,960
little radiator and it's full of oil and

1492
00:51:50,798 --> 00:51:54,519
the benefit of that is is when it's on

1493
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,960
it heats up that oil and kind of

1494
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:58,838
circulates it around inside the radiator

1495
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,838
but it even keeps working once the power

1496
00:51:58,838 --> 00:52:02,920
is turned off right cuz that oil stays

1497
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:04,960
warm that radiator stays warm and it

1498
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,079
keeps kind of heating the space even

1499
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:10,079
when there's not power flowing into the

1500
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:12,079
unit so uh I really like those for

1501
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,839
heating grows because they're a lot

1502
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:17,640
safer than a lot of the other styles of

1503
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:20,199
grow or of of heater I should say and um

1504
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:21,838
having that efficiency factor of they

1505
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:23,358
kind of keep working a little bit even

1506
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,039
when the power's been cut they'll kind

1507
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:27,318
of keep heating the room a little bit

1508
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:29,480
longer cuz they they hold heat in that

1509
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:31,759
radiator that's a good call out

1510
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,760
humidifier dehumidifier I me kind of

1511
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,240
talked about that a little bit I'm not

1512
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,119
sure if you have anything else to add

1513
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:40,439
about those two things um I've used as

1514
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:42,119
far as humidifiers I really like the one

1515
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,079
that build of soil recommends I forget

1516
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:46,400
what it's called it's like the active

1517
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,760
air or something like that but I really

1518
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,280
like it's a little tank that you can

1519
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,720
fill up manually uh which I find really

1520
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,760
helpful where you don't have to like

1521
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:55,199
take the whole tank apart and take it to

1522
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,799
the sink and fill it up it's a thing

1523
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:59,960
where you can just take a picture water

1524
00:52:56,798 --> 00:53:02,119
and dump it in the top and Away you go

1525
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:04,480
uh that's been really helpful to me as

1526
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:05,760
far as dehumidifiers dehumidifiers is

1527
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,798
definitely a place if you're going to

1528
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,720
buy one look for something efficient

1529
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:13,119
because de dehumidifiers can use a ton

1530
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:15,000
of power and if you've got a big fancy

1531
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:18,039
grow I mean look at something like the

1532
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,719
quest uh Quest dehumidification makes

1533
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:22,519
some really efficient really powerful

1534
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:24,159
dehumidifiers they cost a lot but you'll

1535
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:25,440
save money in the long term if you think

1536
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,480
about it you're buying something that's

1537
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,159
going to last you you know maybe a

1538
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:32,440
decade that's a lot of electrical bills

1539
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:34,078
you know so spending a little bit more

1540
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,880
to have something so your bills a little

1541
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,000
lower every month will pay off in the

1542
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:41,720
long term so trying to get something

1543
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,599
efficient uh I have a smaller um frigid

1544
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:46,439
a dehumidifier that I'm using right now

1545
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:48,920
and I really like it a lot it's been

1546
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:51,679
really efficient um despite being kind

1547
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,559
of a home unit uh but just keep in mind

1548
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:56,078
with dehumidifiers also I think most

1549
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:58,720
dehumidifiers on the market are made to

1550
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:01,039
be put in someone's basement and used

1551
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:05,118
you know a month or two a year they're

1552
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:07,679
not designed to be used 247 you know 365

1553
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,680
days a year like we would in a grow so

1554
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:11,279
some of those homebuilt de humidifiers

1555
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,358
aren don't always have the kind of

1556
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,240
reliability or the kind of efficiency

1557
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:17,838
that you'd want for a grow

1558
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:19,479
dehumidifier um so just be aware of that

1559
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:22,719
and you know there's not a whole lot of

1560
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:24,798
like grow centered or like designed for

1561
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,639
your grow dehumidifiers out there that

1562
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:29,199
are small most of them are really big

1563
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:30,358
and really expensive um but either way

1564
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,598
just make sure you're looking at that

1565
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:33,199
efficiency number and make sure you're

1566
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,599
aware of how much power it's going to

1567
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:37,879
use because they do tend to be power

1568
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:39,920
hungry I live in a very dry climate so

1569
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:42,079
I've never had to use a dehumidifier

1570
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,240
here but fortunate enough not to have to

1571
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,200
have add that to my electricity bill but

1572
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:48,318
I do actually to add in a humidifier and

1573
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:51,118
I've tried out so many humidifiers in

1574
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:54,079
the past H what eight years since I've

1575
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,680
been here 9 years and um one of the ones

1576
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,480
that I really like is called Lev Vol

1577
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:59,199
it's a smart he ifier same thing that

1578
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,240
you had mentioned where it's top fill so

1579
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:02,039
you don't have to remove the whole

1580
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:03,639
container flip it over you can actually

1581
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:06,199
just remove the top and fill from the

1582
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:08,558
top but it's also connected to your

1583
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:11,199
smartphone an app to where you can

1584
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:12,798
notify you when it needs to be cleaned

1585
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:15,118
and also when the tank is empty and you

1586
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:16,838
need to refill it I I really like that

1587
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,400
one that's that's been the best one yeah

1588
00:55:16,838 --> 00:55:19,639
if you are getting a humidifier one

1589
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,720
thing to mention is you want definitely

1590
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:22,358
want to get one of those ones where you

1591
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:24,719
can have a set point on it you know a

1592
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:25,960
certain P percent that you're aiming for

1593
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:27,439
cuz some humidifiers you just have the

1594
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:30,039
on button it would just go on and on and

1595
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:33,880
on and on and on but if you have one of

1596
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:35,839
them with the uh with a a humidistat

1597
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,920
humidistat there you go then you're able

1598
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:39,318
to actually have a set point a certain

1599
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,240
percent that you can aim for once it

1600
00:55:39,318 --> 00:55:43,400
reaches that percent the unit will turn

1601
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:45,439
off the one that I mentioned lolta does

1602
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:47,599
have that capability so so we got

1603
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,280
through a lot in this episode man there

1604
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,480
are so many more things that we could

1605
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,480
have gone through but uh I think we

1606
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,838
might have to save it for potentially a

1607
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,440
