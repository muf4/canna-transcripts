1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,539
what's up everybody feel that don't know

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,758
me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,129
you'll watch my extras channel sunrays

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,809
sent me over there 2000 watt LED grow

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,700
light and in this video I'm gonna unbox

6
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:14,099
a unit and I'm also gonna test the power

7
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,230
output first thing out the box is this

8
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,960
welcome guide it has some various

9
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,240
instructions on the inside is the

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,460
extended warranty card and a little note

11
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:29,899
there a 5 foot power cord one rope

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,160
ratchet hanger and one wire hanging kit

13
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:34,140
I'm not gonna go over all of the grow

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,729
lights features in this video but I will

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,289
leave a link to this grow light in the

16
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:39,269
description section below so you can

17
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:42,210
learn more for the part tests I'm gonna

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,940
use the apogee mq 5 under par meter this

19
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,939
meter measures from 389 and meters to

20
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:50,070
692 nanometers plus or minus 5 diameters

21
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:51,689
and the measurements are in ppfd

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,369
and really this is just to give you a

23
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:55,198
general idea of what the power output is

24
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:56,519
for this grow light this test isn't

25
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,500
meant to be a hundred percent accurate

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,690
the reflective walls could increase the

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,238
numbers so just keep that in mind and

28
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:04,798
the Amazon listing sunrays mentions a

29
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:06,899
four foot by four foot flower in

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,790
coverage area with the light 24 inches

31
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,200
away from the top of the plants in this

32
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,680
video take three different measurements

33
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,840
20 inches away 24 inches away and 36

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,909
inches away and this is in a full foot

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,270
by 4 foot grove 10 with the veg you

36
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:24,359
switch on it pulls 224 watts with the

37
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:26,819
flower switch on it pulls 202 watts and

38
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,819
with both the veg and flower switches on

39
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:32,508
it pulls 406 watts alright let's get

40
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:32,508
into the Benjamins

41
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:50,650
