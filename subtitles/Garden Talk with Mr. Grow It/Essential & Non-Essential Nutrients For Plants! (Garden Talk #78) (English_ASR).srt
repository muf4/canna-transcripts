1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,879
coming up on garden talk it has been

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,640
well documented that there are 92 maybe

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,960
more naturally occurring elements on

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,800
earth wherein 82 of which have been

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,920
found in plants

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,960
and then the plant says okay guys

7
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:20,000
if you just give me a tiny bit of nickel

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,480
and a little bit of biology i can turn

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,719
your trash that you're giving me into

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,278
something usable and we always try to

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,278
say it's it's twenty percent silt and

12
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,800
it's and it's ten percent clay and

13
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,119
that's all these things

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,600
all those things creates a magnetic

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,759
charge and if you have biology we talk

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,000
about your ec increasing because your

17
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,479
biology and your magnetic charge and

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,558
your magnet gets stronger and stronger

19
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,199
you'll even start to see the atherosin

20
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,119
as the purple starting to appear in the

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,920
leaves but what you're not going to see

22
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:55,320
is you'll see a huge reduction in in

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,320
essential oils

24
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,038

plants he also touches upon what

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,320

love the controller with the temperature

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,920
and humidity programming and having

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,000
control of different fan speeds this

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,679
makes it so much easier to control my

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,479

thanks for coming on uh this is your

88
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,560
second time on the podcast first time

89
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,318
was a big success you know lots of

90
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,479
people in the comment section demanding

91
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,399
for that part too so here we are part

92
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,840
two in the first episode we did together

93
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,519
you talked about some of the essential

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,039
nutrients for plants

95
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,680
and you also touch upon what

96
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,759
deficiencies and toxicities look like

97
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,080
for those nutrients we covered so many

98
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,639
of these elements nitrogen sulfur

99
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,840
phosphorus potassium magnesium iron

100
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:56,238
calcium manganese and copper so we got a

101
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,319
whole bunch done still a lot more to go

102
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,920
mark actually created a presentation for

103
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,598
this so if you'd like to follow along

104
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,199
i'll put a link to the presentation in

105
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,119
the description section below and if

106
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,280
you're on one of the podcast platforms

107
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,039
find this episode on youtube in order to

108
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,039
access the link to the presentation i'll

109
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,959
show what i can on the screen this time

110
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,878
but if there are any slides that youtube

111
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,399
might not like i'll leave those ones out

112
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,798
so let's continue where we left off

113
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,478
essential elements for plants part two

114
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,799
and i think you've snuck some

115
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,959
non-essential elements in there too so

116
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,639
i'm excited to see what you got in there

117
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,839
but yeah i'll let you roll on with the

118
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,360
presentation i know there's a little bit

119
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,638
of an introduction in there and stuff

120
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,400
which will help for those that didn't

121
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,079
catch the first episode we did together

122
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,599
so take it away

123
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,039
chris thank you so much and just like

124
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,600
you said if you haven't checked out the

125
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,600
part one highly recommend to do so on

126
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,919
this presentation we are going to talk

127
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,680
about a couple things we talked about in

128
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,120
part one the only reason why we're

129
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,800
talking about again though is because i

130
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,600
don't i didn't think i did a good enough

131
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,680
job um really going through it and

132
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,639
explain the significance so this time

133
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,720
around

134
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,639
we're going to do a much better job so

135
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,280
the title this is deficiencies

136
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,280
toxicities minerals and biology

137
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,239
presented by mr growit and perfect

138
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,918
gardens

139
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,360
like uh chris said if you're not

140
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,519
following along the description is down

141
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,720
below if you put your email in you're

142
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,399
going to get three things you're going

143
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,720
to get the presentation you're going to

144
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,198
get a free visual plant guide so

145
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,440
something you can actually um a lot of

146
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,360
times you you don't know the deficiency

147
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,199
name but you know what you're looking at

148
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,360
so what we did is we created a visual

149
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,199
plant guide so you can actually what

150
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,520
you're seeing you can reference it

151
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,600
scroll over and then see whether it's a

152
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,758
deficiency of toxicity and most likely

153
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,160
what it is in addition you're going to

154
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,400
receive a free audio book all about

155
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,240
minerals for plants and for the human

156
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,839
body

157
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,400

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,240
farmers solving the world act problems

168
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,639
our mission is we are we are here to

169
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,160
help you grow our values our integrity

170
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,319
putting the shopping cart back every

171
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,960
time sustainability doing our due

172
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,600
diligence and being present one problem

173
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,198
one solution at a time we are an army of

174
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,960
growers

175
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,280
so what is perfect gardens perfect

176
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,680
gardens is an online retail store and a

177
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,879
growing community our mission is to help

178
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,959
you grow

179
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,959
one of those ways is by using testing

180
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,038
and teaching you about products that

181
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,478
will help create long-term regenerative

182
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:35,918
practices

183
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,918
we think that ninety percent of the

184
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,318
products sold in most guardian stores

185
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,680
are just there to have you repurchase it

186
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,280
the following year

187
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,840
throughout this presentation we'll be

188
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,359
talking about a few brands we support we

189
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,359
are not saying that you should purchase

190
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,280
these products we are saying that you

191
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,680
should look at the raw materials of what

192
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,879
these products are created from and then

193
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,720
start there

194
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,598
we hope that by guiding you to purchase

195
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,120
high quality products it will in one

196
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:02,959
part help fulfill our mission here at

197
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,639
perfect gardens which is to help you

198
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,159
grow

199
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,400
okay so we're going to talk about the

200
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,759
law minimum real quick one more time and

201
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,359
we're going to give some examples around

202
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,038
the law of minimum because i think by

203
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,960
giving these examples

204
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,199
in the beginning this presentation it

205
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,359
will make the rest of the minerals as we

206
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,840
go through them a lot more efficient and

207
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,919
easier to understand so the law minimum

208
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,239
states that growth is dictated not by

209
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,719
the total resources available but by the

210
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,038
scarcest resource today we'll be talking

211
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,440
about the five most limiting factors

212
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,038
that support enzyme production

213
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,319
eighty percent of the deficiencies

214
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:40,478
toxicities bugs mold low yield and

215
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,840
crappy quality are because of a lack of

216
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,878
enzymes

217
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:47,679
those five most limiting factors are one

218
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,960
carbon slash humic layer two

219
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,918
clean and consistent watering practices

220
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:59,120
three ionic sulfated minerals

221
00:07:53,918 --> 00:08:01,120
four biology and five co2

222
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,639
okay so you've heard me say this before

223
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,560
the most unique thing about the canon

224
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,759
industry is the testing of our terpene

225
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,918
profiles

226
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,400
the reason why is because more terps

227
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,478
means higher overall plant health

228
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,878
we are talking about nutrient density

229
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,560
not just the weight of the yield in this

230
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,360
presentation we are going to be going

231
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,120
from academics to application

232
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,800
knowledge is not power it is the

233
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,800
application of knowledge that's power

234
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
and through this presentation i'm going

235
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,759
to be encouraging you to take more

236
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,000
action

237
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,840
the brands below are supported by us

238
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,278
because they help fix the five most

239
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,679
limiting factors

240
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,080
pit moss pit moss is a little fibrous

241
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,918
paper and it's your carbon is your

242
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,158
consistent watering is your water

243
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,679
conservation and it's the future home

244
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,919
for your microbes and minerals to

245
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:49,120
complete their enzyme production cycle

246
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:51,278
which is 24 hours we recommend to don't

247
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,639
don't start over five percent i start

248
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,799
with five percent of pit moss in your

249
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:58,080
total media and then slowly add in over

250
00:08:54,799 --> 00:09:00,559
time drops of balance drop balance is 64

251
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,440
plus negative ionic sulfated minerals

252
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,679
plus it cleans over 400 separate

253
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,880
man-made chemicals out of your water

254
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:11,838
terraganix tarragon is specifically em-1

255
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,919
more than 80 separate bacteria colonies

256
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,920
we always recommend at indo fungi

257
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,319
there's lots of brands out there that

258
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,719
have endo fungi's we recommend either

259
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,800
recharge or or micos from extreme

260
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,720
gardening and then last but not least is

261
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:27,359
organic shield organic shield is a

262
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,600
complete ipm product that will take care

263
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,440
of any of your bikes in addition to this

264
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,120
though when it breaks down it breaks

265
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,320
down into water

266
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,000
co2 and sugar that being the fifth most

267
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,720
limiting factor

268
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,399
okay so you have seen this picture if

269
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,080
you have downloaded the presentation

270
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,320
before in this situation though i

271
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,040
actually added a few more things to help

272
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,200
give the visual representation between

273
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:53,519
the relationship between bacteria

274
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,800
minerals and enzymes so let's explain

275
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,720
this real fast

276
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,599
enzymes are responsible for breaking

277
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,639
apart and rewelding dna

278
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,320
rna

279
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:07,439
amino acids peptides and protein bonds

280
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,720
every enzyme needs enzyme cofactors

281
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,200
bacteria make enzyme cofactors

282
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,040
all enzyme cofactors are dependent upon

283
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,360
the amount of trace minerals in the

284
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,679
environment these enzymes can perform

285
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,919
their tasks hundreds of times before

286
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,479
degrading in the plant it has been well

287
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,559
documented that there are 92 maybe more

288
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,560
naturally occurring elements on earth

289
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,838
wherein the 82 of which have been found

290
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,518
in plants

291
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,399
so just you got to think about that for

292
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,440
a second

293
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,078
if plants took up those 82 separate

294
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,480
minerals then that means bacteria at

295
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,639
some point made them water soluble so

296
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,480
that the plant could take them up

297
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,799
and the plant wouldn't take it up if

298
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,720
there wasn't a purpose for them the next

299
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,039
slide real quick also talks a little bit

300
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,879
around visual around your dna rna

301
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,360
proteins amino acids and we're going to

302
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:57,200
explain real fast what this is your dna

303
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,600
is responsible for storing and

304
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,160
transferring genetic information

305
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,040
rna directly codes the amino acids and

306
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:08,319
acts as a messenger between dna and the

307
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:10,240
ribosomes which are large and complex

308
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,120
enzymes

309
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,519
to make proteins all interactions need

310
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,480
bacteria and cofactors

311
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,039
amino acids plus enzymes bond together

312
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,759
in two or three to make peptides

313
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:26,000
peptides plus enzymes bond together to

314
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:29,360
become complete proteins

315
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,120
all of this happens in a 24-hour cycle

316
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,720
and so the most important thing to

317
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,919
understand about this is that the

318
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,360
bacteria and the minerals need to stay

319
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:41,838
in the same spot with a consistent water

320
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,079
source for that enzyme reaction to

321
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,839
complete its job in that 24-hour cycle

322
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,919
and if one of these things goes out of

323
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,240
whack that production cycle has to

324
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,919
restart or it's incomplete okay so let's

325
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,000
talk about the law of tolerance let's

326
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,759
give a quick definition of what this is

327
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,519
a law stating that the abundance or

328
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,439
distribution of organism can be

329
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,600
controlled by certain factors where

330
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,320
levels of these exceed the maximum or

331
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,079
minimum limit of tolerance of that of

332
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,240
that orgasm so what does that mean

333
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,919
exactly well just like have we talked

334
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,000
about before there are zones of

335
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,078
intolerance and then there are the

336
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,159
tolerance range and then there's the

337
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:19,120
optimum range and so let's give some

338
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:22,399
examples so example is like ph if you

339
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,560
have a ph of 3 or a ph of 9 there's

340
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,639
probably in the zones of intolerance and

341
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:29,119
your plants are going to die fairly

342
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:33,440
quickly but if you have let's say a ph

343
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,759
of 5.6 and 7.3 that's more the zone the

344
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,000
tolerance range the plant's still going

345
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,360
to grow it's still going to do its job

346
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,879
but it's probably probably not going to

347
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,200
see the full potential

348
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:47,120
and if you are in that optimum range of

349
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,200
5.8 to let's say 6.6 where the majority

350
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,799
of the minerals are available well

351
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,320
that's going to be your optimum range

352
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,679
and you're probably going to see a

353
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,720
better potential of what that plant

354
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,879
could do

355
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,278
other examples are temperature if it's

356
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,399
too hot or it's too cold you can imagine

357
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,799
what happens starts to happen

358
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,799
deficiencies if your light intensity

359
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,559
your photons your dli your daily light

360
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,078
integral is too much so if you're giving

361
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,838
too little of light what's going to

362
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,078
happen to the plant right and if you

363
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,920
give too much light what it what's going

364
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,638
to happen the plant and the the plant

365
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,399
has has different expressions uh

366
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,480
throughout this so if the plants doesn't

367
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,320
have a lot of photosynthesis going we're

368
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,000
going to see it in a deficiency but if

369
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,879
it's too much light we're probably going

370
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,440
to see

371
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,958
a tacoing or or

372
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,480
the plant's going to say hey

373
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,199
listen it's a little too much light for

374
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,440
me

375
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,920
the last one i want to bring up is the

376
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,200
magnetic charge or the parts per million

377
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,719
or the ec

378
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,480
all these are really important to

379
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,160
understand around minerals and that's

380
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,839
what pretty much the rest of the

381
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,360
presentation is going to be about i

382
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,320
think one that i'd like to throw in

383
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,120
there relates to the temperature and

384
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,360
actually relative humidity would be vpd

385
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,120
a lot of people chase after vpd if you

386
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,639
don't know what that is google it check

387
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,759
out the vpd charts there's different

388
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,399
charts for

389
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:03,278
ceiling stage vegetative stage flowering

390
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,839
stage for example but it's basically at

391
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,439
a certain temperature what is the ideal

392
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,440
humidity that you should be at and on

393
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,959
the chart there's a dark green range

394
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,279
there's a lighter green range and then

395
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,479
there's a yellow or red range so i

396
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,000
thought that was a good example i

397
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,920
figured i'd throw out there i i love

398
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,639
that chris actually the reason why i

399
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:23,039
love that is because your your brain

400
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,000
headed to exactly where i was hoping it

401
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,759
would go uh right into vpd as being the

402
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,078
next example of how these all play out

403
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,679
so that was phenomenal i know that the

404
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,759
presentation's working

405
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,559
uh so

406
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,919
so magnets um and let's give an example

407
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,000
around the law of tolerance around

408
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,439
magnets and we're gonna play into right

409
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,360
right exactly what chris is talking

410
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,240
about temperature and bpd

411
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,720
so your magnets phosphorus is your

412
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,720
dominant macro negative

413
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,519
ion magnet calcium is your dominant

414
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,680
macronutrient positive cation magnet

415
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,919
when you balance your phosphorus all the

416
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,599
other negative ions can be balanced so

417
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,360
that means all the other trace minerals

418
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,480
that have a negative charge can be

419
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,879
balanced is phosphorus is balanced if if

420
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,720
calcium is balanced that means all the

421
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,039
other minerals that have a positive

422
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,800
charge that are smaller than calcium can

423
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,399
be balanced but when one of those that

424
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,639
is off remember we're talking about the

425
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,639
law of tolerance too much phosphorus too

426
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,278
much calcium all the rest starts to get

427
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,360
thrown off so now let's go into how how

428
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,879
does the magnets play into the

429
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,879
relationship around temperature and vpd

430
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,838
so as calcium gets warmer it gets

431
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:35,679
heavier and its positive charge gets

432
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,519
starts to get neutralized because of

433
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,638
additional negative electrons it

434
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,759
collects

435
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,000
when the leaf temperature is above 86

436
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,440
degrees fahrenheit plants will go from

437
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,919
photosynthesis to a respirative state

438
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,560
at this point calcium stops being taken

439
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,639
up by the xylem and the calcium already

440
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,958
taken up starts to settle into the

441
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,519
oldest growth of the plant until calcium

442
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,479
can gain back its full positive cation

443
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,600
charge

444
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,560
in addition it gets lighter calcium will

445
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,720
get lighter in density as it cools by

446
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,799
the losing of the electrons and new

447
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,440
calcium is able to flow all the way back

448
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:16,159
up the xylem attracting the negative

449
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,279
ions back up with it in addition you may

450
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:22,319
also see leaves deform in new growth

451
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:24,639
because your vpd is off so this is where

452
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,440
i'm trying to now relate to the language

453
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,959
of the of of where all of us are talking

454
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,639
about but i'm also connecting it with

455
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,879
the science right here

456
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,959
you may also see purple leaves purple

457
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,519
pedials and the fading from the bottom

458
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,838
up due to a lack of flow of calcium and

459
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,320
boron and this relationship to the speed

460
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,240
of atp production and the robbing of

461
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,160
phosphorus because it is a mobile

462
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,720
nutrient so what does that all mean

463
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,799
example right so when it gets too warm

464
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,959
the calcium stops flowing up the xylem

465
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,639
and it settles back down the plant but

466
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:57,119
the plant is still

467
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,480
doing atp production right atp is

468
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,440
adenosine

469
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,759
phosphate so how does it get neufon a

470
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,360
new phosphorus it robs it from the

471
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,199
bottom of the plant and takes it up so

472
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,279
that way if it gets too hot you may

473
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,640
start to see phosphorus deficiencies for

474
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,720
this reason because it's starting to

475
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,240
cannibalize itself to continue to keep

476
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,480
doing its job

477
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,798
calcium and phosphorus flow together

478
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,480
like a positive and negative magnet

479
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:21,918
calcium and phosphorus flow together

480
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,480
until phosphorus and other

481
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,400
micronutrients are released and taken up

482
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,679
in the sap of the plant called the

483
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,200
phloem

484
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,600
so the xylem is the xylem is the

485
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,600
transportation of water minerals the

486
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,959
phloem is the sap where the chemical

487
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:40,959
reactions the enzymes do their job so in

488
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,440
between it and we've done a number of

489
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,960
videos showing on on that

490
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,919
that when you see the xylem and the

491
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,000
phloem the bacteria are traveling in

492
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,919
between them constantly and the reason

493
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
why is because they're they're the

494
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,200
intermediate between the xylem and the

495
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,839
phloem

496
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,160
all magnets minerals need to be present

497
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,599
in a 24-hour period to complete their

498
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,240
enzyme reaction in the cellular

499
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,558
construction temperature to optimize and

500
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,000
enzymatic activity is between

501
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:12,399
76 and 83 degrees fahrenheit

502
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
so all of you guys have seen this slide

503
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,600
the biggest thing to pull from here is

504
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,119
the question you need to ask yourself

505
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,000
when you see a deficiency and the

506
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:22,639
toxicity is the deficiency or toxicity

507
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,119
appearing in the older or newer growth

508
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,120
immobile nutrients shows their

509
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:30,239
deficiencies or excess in the newer

510
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:32,879
leaves mobile deficiencies show up as a

511
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,798
deficiency or excess in the older leaves

512
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,640
semi-semi-mobile

513
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,119
can show up in

514
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,400
in the older or newer leaves so just

515
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,839
understand that question if you

516
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,679
understand the question is where am i

517
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:45,839
seeing it you are able to eliminate

518
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,000
literally half your problems almost

519
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,879
immediately

520
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,919
okay

521
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,440
so now let's get into the first mineral

522
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,160
or really the continuation of the

523
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,558
minerals from part uh part one the the

524
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,480
reason why is once again is because when

525
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,319
you understand

526
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,000
the what i explained up top it's going

527
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,000
to make the language and everything i

528
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
read here it's going to be able to flow

529
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,599
in like you're just reading a the best

530
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,519
book you've ever read or the watch the

531
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,359
best movie you've ever seen

532
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:16,000
okay so zinc

533
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:18,240
aids in enzyme production that are

534
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,319
responsible for driving many metabolic

535
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,319
reactions in all crops growth and

536
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:25,200
development would stop if specific

537
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:27,599
enzymes were not present in plant tissue

538
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,720
carbohydrates proteins and chlorophyll

539
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,240
formation is reduced in enzyme deficient

540
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,640
plants

541
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,679
the significance of zinc stems from its

542
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,640
property as a divalent positive cation

543
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,640
magnet

544
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:46,160
which means that zinc ions can form two

545
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,799
chemical bonds with a with an ion

546
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,440
at ions are molecules that have a

547
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:53,918
negative magnetic charge

548
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,038
more trace minerals being present helps

549
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,280
the release of other minerals at a ion

550
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,599
exchange site when zinc is present it

551
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,599
helps release and hold two other

552
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:05,439
negative minerals so you kind of have to

553
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,240
think about this when you have a big

554
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,640
mineral it doesn't do a really good job

555
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,038
at holding on to those smaller tiny

556
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,799
minerals you actually need as you go

557
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,279
farther and farther down the smaller the

558
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,960
mineral you it needs to go

559
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,399
actually be able to hold on to those

560
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,759
smaller magnets

561
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,600
that's why

562
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,359
it's it it's important to understand

563
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:28,240
that this the bigger ones can't really

564
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,558
hold on to the smaller ones very well

565
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,960
so zinc is the zinc they you can also

566
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:35,519
call these things chelating agents right

567
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,159
they they there's another word that that

568
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,679
works in this in this expression of

569
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,760
trying to understand what i'm what i'm

570
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,960
trying to say here

571
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:47,359
zinc helps soil structure because it

572
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,120
increases the magnetic charge in the

573
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,399
attracting and the releasing of other

574
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,319
minerals

575
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,880
when smaller magnets are present it

576
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:57,599
creates a stronger magnet that is called

577
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,600
our humic layer it is why we have to

578
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,759
return what we take

579
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:04,240
and i hope that makes sense your humic

580
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:06,798
layer is just a composition of all these

581
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,480
magnets and we always try to say it's

582
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:12,079
it's 20 silt and it's and it's 10 clay

583
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,400
and it's all these things

584
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,399
all those things creates a magnetic

585
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,880
charge and if you have biology

586
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,200
we talk about your ec increasing because

587
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,640
your biology and your magnetic charge

588
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,080
and your magnet gets stronger and

589
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,559
stronger

590
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,798
zinc is an immobile nutrient so look to

591
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,798
the newer leaves first to identify a

592
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,798
deficiency in toxicity if you're

593
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,879
wondering zinc is found in drops of

594
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,720
balance and if you're over there on

595
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,320
drops of balance.com make sure to type

596
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,200
in mr growit

597
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:43,279
for additional discounts because all the

598
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,759
products that we're talking about today

599
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:48,558
are available on dropsbalance.com

600
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,599
also on perfect gardens as well okay so

601
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,918
the zinc

602
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:54,319
zinc i i tried to find a pitcher that

603
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,799
really represents a zinc deficiency

604
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:58,720
because um these these deficiency and

605
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:59,679
toxicities are going to appear in your

606
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,839
plant

607
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:05,440
specifically during certain times

608
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,879
because of the of the enzyme enzymatic

609
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,519
production that these minerals

610
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,679
specifically do during vegetative state

611
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,679
or flowering right

612
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,360
so i tried to find a picture that would

613
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,880
is actually going to you'll actually

614
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,079
most likely see

615
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,679
versus

616
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:21,759
providing too many pictures and the one

617
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,120
that really is going to pop out and you

618
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,279
see it you're going to be like okay

619
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,199
that's a zinc deficiency you're also

620
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,839
you're often going to see the stem tips

621
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,640
fail to elongate and grow and grow shoot

622
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,558
tips they become bunched up and you and

623
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,520
you'll you'll know what i mean it just

624
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,240
goes like

625
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:40,079
it goes like this and it's just it's

626
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,319
really the only mineral deficiency that

627
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,158
does that okay so the next one the

628
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,558
benefits of malignant

629
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,799
important in microbial nitrogen

630
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:51,440
assimilation part of the nitrogen

631
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:53,679
fixation cycle so due to the presence of

632
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,519
nitrogens the enzyme that performs the

633
00:22:53,679 --> 00:23:01,200
into fixation to the nh3 ammonia

634
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:03,839
and the nitrate reductus the enzyme that

635
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,038
performs the first step in the nitrate

636
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:09,519
no3 negative so it turns the nitrate no3

637
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:10,720
negative to a nitrite no

638
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:11,599
two negative

639
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,919
so

640
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:17,678
just to kind of understand this right so

641
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,880
just malignant itself it helps use the

642
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,440
the gas

643
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,760
that's abundant in our air

644
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,240
to make it more available

645
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:29,440
for the plant okay so i find that to be

646
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,359
incredibly incredibly important

647
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,000
and then we talked about right these two

648
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:35,678
enzymes there are these two bacterias

649
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,679
create these enzymes

650
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,159
that allowed

651
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,360
malignant to to be utilized to its full

652
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,120
potential

653
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,879
so remember we're talking about what's

654
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,199
that most limiting factor is enzyme

655
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,360
production is also important to

656
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,319
potassium absorption because the same

657
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:54,399
bacteria that does the nitrogen fixation

658
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,480
also breaks down the potassium mineral

659
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,080
and makes them water soluble through the

660
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,079
cation exchange

661
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,879
so really understand the point here

662
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:06,158
right so if you have a couple bacteria

663
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,640
these few bacterias can soluble soluble

664
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,520
eyes make these minerals water soluble

665
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,759
and just and if you have one bacteria is

666
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:17,200
capable of producing

667
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:19,038
five ten hundreds of enzymes hundreds of

668
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,519
enzymes if you if there you just have

669
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,759
the right mineral in that environment

670
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,480
and we as we go into the the next few

671
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,480
slides i'll explain more about that

672
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,159
you normally will see a zinc deficiency

673
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,400
with mo because of the role they both

674
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,679
play in photosynthesis why should you

675
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,840
care about mo

676
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:39,440
well australia went from a wheat

677
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:42,158
importer to a wheat exporter in one year

678
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,159
just by adding malignant okay and if

679
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,039
you're wondering million yes is in drops

680
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,278
balance so so you got to understand this

681
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,839
okay malignant is used in

682
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,679
very very very tiny amounts if you use

683
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,359
too much it can get

684
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,440
your plants won't do well it will become

685
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,399
very toxic for the plants but just by

686
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,440
adding this very small amount an entire

687
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,120
country that had to import wheat the

688
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,038
very next year went to being able to

689
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,038
sell weight so if you're wondering

690
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,640
whether this trace mineral can increase

691
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:12,319
your return on investment

692
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,679
yes it can it can boost your internal

693
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,439
return investment because it's gonna it

694
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,679
can help boost your yield

695
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,200
malignant is a mobile nutrient so look

696
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,720
to the older lease first for your

697
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:25,120
deficiencies and toxicities

698
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,240
and so remember malignant

699
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,359
um

700
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,679
it's a mobile nutrient and the picture

701
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,879
once again i try to find it is it

702
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,120
represents

703
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,278
the plant when you see it a malignant

704
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,399
deficiency it'll look like the plant is

705
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:40,880
aging

706
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,640
but it's not maturing and what i mean by

707
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,559
that is when you see the plant you're

708
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,640
going to see the the like our plants

709
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:47,918
you'll see the pistols coming out you're

710
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,840
going to you're going to you're going to

711
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,679
think like the plants maturing like it's

712
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,678
getting ready to be harvested you'll

713
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,320
even start to see the atheroscine it's

714
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,159
the purple starting to appear in the in

715
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:01,200
the leaves but what you're not going to

716
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,200
see is you'll see a huge reduction in in

717
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,440
essential oils and that's what i mean

718
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,000
right the plants maturing or the plants

719
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,440
aging but it's not maturing

720
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,200
and that's and that's what i mean by the

721
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,120
difference so it's very distinguishable

722
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,200
when you see the malignant deficiency

723
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,519
you'll know exactly what i what i mean

724
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,200
me when i when you see this picture and

725
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,359
youtube isn't going to allow me to post

726
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,720
this picture so this is going to be one

727
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,199
that you're going to want to download

728
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,360
the presentation for just click on the

729
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,960
link to access the presentation for so

730
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,759
you can see it's very interesting

731
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,079
picture here one of the rarer ones is

732
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,759
this type of deficiency so once you see

733
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,158
it you might have come across it in the

734
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,679
past but it's it's very rare so there's

735
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,159
a good chance that you didn't come

736
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,798
across this chris is 100 right in our

737
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,200
group we we are have clients now

738
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:49,440
worldwide all in our membership group

739
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,798
and we must have seen a linkedin

740
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,278
deficiency maybe twice out of

741
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,519
i don't know four or five hundred uh

742
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,359
gross throughout the whole year so if

743
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,119
you think about that that was like

744
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:02,959
they probably grew two or three times in

745
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,319
the same spot so out of 1200 separate

746
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,360
grows we must have seen them electron

747
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:09,759
deficiently two two times so it's so

748
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:12,479
it's really just you're not going to

749
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:14,640
you you might you might not see it but

750
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,400
just understand that that trace mineral

751
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,880
if it's applied appropriately with the

752
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,798
right bacterias it can increase your

753
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,240
your yield and that's what's going to

754
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:23,679
happen with a lot of the rest of these

755
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,079
minerals that we talked about on this

756
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,480
presentation they're not going to appear

757
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:31,599
in your plant

758
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,839
whether it makes it green or

759
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:34,879
makes it tall or produces the flowers

760
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,038
it's

761
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,960
they appear in the plants differently

762
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:39,919
through the taste

763
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,679
the

764
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:46,000
the overall quality the terpene profiles

765
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,640
you you you see them

766
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,919
they they represent themselves in a in a

767
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,080
different level in a different

768
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,880
expression not just in the yield they

769
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:58,079
they represent themselves in another way

770
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:01,360
so benefits of manganese

771
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:04,000
magazine aids in more than 300 enzymes

772
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,079
that regulates the human body and plants

773
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,558
so we were talking about you have a

774
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:11,199
bacteria and you have manganese

775
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:12,000
it can produce 300 enzymes for you just

776
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,679
just

777
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,440
these two things that's that's huge and

778
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,519
those enzymes go on to do the function

779
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,080
hundreds of times before the plant

780
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,599
degrades it i find that to be incredibly

781
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,319
fascinating without manganese

782
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,000
chlorophyll cannot capture sun energy

783
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,398
for photosynthesis

784
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,398
we covered this in part presentation one

785
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:32,479
but i i wanted to bring it back up

786
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,719
because we're talking about enzymes and

787
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,480
this is what i'm what we're talking

788
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,960
about the most limiting factor in most

789
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,960
gardens is enzyme production

790
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,960
and what why is this so significant for

791
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,840
me and i always love to re re-say this

792
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,399
is

793
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:49,199
capturing light what is light light is

794
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:51,839
harmonic frequencies so magnesium is the

795
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,080
receiver so plants are are listening to

796
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:56,240
music all day long this is proof in my

797
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,240
opinion that plants do like music plants

798
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,399
interpret the music they are listened to

799
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,839
by the trace minerals and the microbes

800
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:05,199
that are present

801
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:07,678
when you have bacteria and manganese

802
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,759
they are capable of creating once again

803
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,200
over 300 enzymes

804
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,519
absolutely amazing

805
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,200
manganese is an immobile nutrient so

806
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,759
look to the newer leaves first to

807
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,360
identify deficiencies and toxicities in

808
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,679
trace amounts that's all we need

809
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:24,079
remember trace amounts so manganese so

810
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,798
we've seen this deficiency

811
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:28,158
probably no more than 10 times this year

812
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,158
so again this is not something you're

813
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,840
going to see a lot

814
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,559
and a lot of people

815
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:36,959
are going to see this uh and they might

816
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:39,359
think it's a calcium deficiency and

817
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,720
calcium and and manganese are actually

818
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:42,959
both immobile

819
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,519
nutrients so they're going to be being

820
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,038
used as the plants growing so they'll

821
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,480
actually appear

822
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:53,278
in at the same time if it's deficient so

823
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,480
it's so the big difference though is

824
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,720
calcium

825
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,640
deficiencies you could see holes in your

826
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,880
leaves or you could see a like um

827
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,720
like roses in the leaves like spots but

828
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,200
in this one you're gonna see more like

829
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,200
brown spots and it's different and if

830
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,960
you're if you download the presentation

831
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,558
you're going to be able to see

832
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,038
exactly what i'm describing once you see

833
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:16,960
it you'll be able to distinguish it 100

834
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:19,679
from calcium deficiency i've actually

835
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,679
come across this a handful of times and

836
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,840
i can't even count the number of times

837
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,919
somebody has commented on my forum for

838
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:27,519
example posted a picture like this and

839
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,038
thought it was calcium so they just

840
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:30,398
upped the cal mag and they're doing more

841
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:32,720
harm than good right because they're not

842
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:34,839
actually fixing the problem there so

843
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,519
this gets mixed up with calcium

844
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:39,119
deficiency so much and you know you

845
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:41,038
already said that but the yellowing that

846
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:41,759
kind of goes along in

847
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:43,759
with

848
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,319
like the the spotting

849
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:50,000
i think that's a major indicator that

850
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:52,720
it's actually manganese and not calcium

851
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,640
that is actually a great observation

852
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,240
chris and it's something it's so funny

853
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,840
it's it's not until someone points it

854
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,120
out but that you begin to notice it

855
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:03,359
yourself right i i fixated on that brown

856
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:05,278
for so so long that if

857
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,038
i think if i would have

858
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,200
presented it the way you just described

859
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:12,319
exactly the the yellowing that follows

860
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,640
along with it uh manganese 100 that's a

861
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:16,879
great way and it's like a random

862
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,559
yellowing it's not your typical yelling

863
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,559
that you'd see off of

864
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:22,639
magnesium deficiency where it's like the

865
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:25,038
intervenal corrosis it's like just

866
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,559
scattered and random on the leaf it's

867
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:28,640
super interesting

868
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,240
and when you go back to that the slide

869
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,960
right before it what does manganese do

870
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,359
right chlorophyll uh and we're we're

871
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,240
talking about that we're describing

872
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,839
the what the megan oil is doing if it's

873
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,359
deficient within the plant and we're

874
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,119
seeing it too and i love that that's

875
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:47,038
beautiful chris thanks for pointing that

876
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:49,678
out okay so benefits of boron this is i

877
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,919
love boron boron is the throttle to

878
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,840
sugar transportation and is responsible

879
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,000
for moving the energy into growing parts

880
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:57,918
of the plant plays a key role in

881
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,720
integrated pest management

882
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,278
boron also plays a key role in cell wall

883
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,038
formation and the functional integrity

884
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:07,119
of biological membranes

885
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:09,119
specifically helps move the energy in

886
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:12,000
the last three weeks of the plant's life

887
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:14,239
cycle so it moves that sugar

888
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,319
into the fruiting and pollination and

889
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,720
seed setting so

890
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,038
again if you want

891
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,000
really strong

892
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:25,278
long

893
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,240
lasting flavorful food nutritional dense

894
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:30,640
food where the where the flavor actually

895
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,558
lingers in your mouth and you your mouth

896
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,559
kind of waters

897
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:36,879
that's because there's boron because

898
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:39,278
it's shifting the the sugars it plays a

899
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,278
role in membrane metabolism and function

900
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:44,159
thereby being involved in enzyme

901
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:47,679
reaction as well as the transportation

902
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:51,679
for ions metabolites and hormones boron

903
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:54,080
is required in very small amounts it is

904
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,000
an immobile nutrient so look to the new

905
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,278
release to identify deficiencies and

906
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,240
toxicities

907
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:02,798
so with this picture i pre i presented

908
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,319
and chris just uh this

909
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:06,000
obviously this picture isn't going to be

910
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:08,000
available as well because we're showing

911
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,200
a can of picture make sure to download

912
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,480
the presentation but just to kind of

913
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,240
highlight what we were talking about a

914
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,640
little bit before do you when you see

915
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,558
this picture you're seeing the the rust

916
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,200
and the brown happening

917
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:22,879
in in the in the leaves but when you

918
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,120
look at the flower the flowers like

919
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,440
almost near maturity and you could tell

920
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,199
like you'll see the deficiency happen

921
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,600
almost when this

922
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,840
at the near end of flowering and why is

923
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,278
that right well it's because boron is

924
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:36,879
responsible for transferring those

925
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,200
sugars especially in those last three

926
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,000
weeks so you're going to see the the

927
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:45,440
expression of a deficiency more often

928
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,599
than a toxicity with boron and it's in

929
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,000
it's going to show up

930
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:52,398
when when the majority of the enzymatic

931
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,599
production is happening for that plant

932
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:55,359
for boron

933
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:57,038
i've actually never come across this

934
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:58,959
before it's

935
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:01,038
so rare a great picture by the way

936
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,798
really good picture there once i've seen

937
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:05,200
it like once personally in my in my

938
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:07,599
whole life too it's it's a very you

939
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,559
don't see it very much and it's because

940
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:10,239
these

941
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:11,358
these other minerals some of a lot of

942
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,678
these minerals

943
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:15,440
they they they like we were talking

944
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,918
about before there is essential minerals

945
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,200
and beneficial minerals right and these

946
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,239
beneficial minerals and i'll explain a

947
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,398
little bit more on the next slide as

948
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,398
well but beneficial minerals they can be

949
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:28,159
replaced by other minerals so they don't

950
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,398
they don't think they're absolutely

951
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,280
essential so if you have like the enough

952
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,878
of the right chemistry it these these

953
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,960
minerals can be interchangeable with

954
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:39,199
other with other ones and so that's why

955
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,440
they don't really appear as they don't

956
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,838
really appear much just because there's

957
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,320
enough chemistry to to do the function

958
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:47,199
it and but it's not the same thing but

959
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,280
it

960
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,439
it does what needs to do

961
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,839
okay so cobalt the cobalt is a

962
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,559
beneficial nutrient for single cell

963
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:58,639
organisms human beings and other mammals

964
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:01,039
but it has not been considered as the

965
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:02,480
essential micronutrient for plants does

966
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:04,639
that make any sense

967
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,519
instead this element along with other

968
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:09,920
elements like aluminum selenium

969
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:11,920
silicon titanium

970
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,240
has been considered as a beneficial

971
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,480
element for plants a beneficial element

972
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:17,838
can improve plant health status at low

973
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,760
concentrations

974
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:21,039
for the element to be considered an

975
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,640
essential

976
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:25,759
it it must be required by plants to

977
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,480
complete

978
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,560
its life cycle

979
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,800
must not be replaceable by other

980
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:37,119
elements and must

981
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:39,039
directly participate in plant metabolism

982
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,358
when you look at a definition it that

983
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:44,559
does make sense right when you when you

984
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:46,480
think about it like that it's like do

985
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,960
do i need this to produce leaves and

986
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,320
stem and the the seed or the fruit i'm

987
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,320
looking for

988
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,640
although

989
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,320
when you explain what they do it it you

990
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,639
begin to wonder why isn't it considered

991
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,119
a beneficial mineral so

992
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:03,759
cobalt inhibits the formation of

993
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,720
ethylene and delays

994
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:10,480
send essence uh senescence it basically

995
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:13,358
is slows aging so cobalt is a is an anti

996
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,159
anti-aging mineral basically

997
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:19,358
aging and maturing are different things

998
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:22,480
you you can still mature without aging

999
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:24,639
so aging is being brittle slow and weak

1000
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,800
maturing is reaching your highest

1001
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,159
potential and

1002
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,480
all of us have seen it when you have

1003
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:31,519
like this amazing grow

1004
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,599
like

1005
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,358
you at the very end even when the

1006
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,680
athleticism is happening the purple and

1007
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:40,880
the leaves are happening the plant still

1008
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:43,759
looks like it can keep going

1009
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,240
the that's because it's matured it

1010
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,640
hasn't it hasn't really aged cobalt and

1011
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:51,118
rhizosphere bacteria are responsible in

1012
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,519
growing root tips and synthesizing

1013
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,720
cytokines we pay a lot of money for

1014
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:59,280
insect frass mushroom compost and kelp

1015
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:01,039
why because of cytokines

1016
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,839
cytokinins are plant hormones that

1017
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:06,239
regulate plant growth and so much more

1018
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:08,719
rhizobia and other nitrogen fixation

1019
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:10,959
bacteria require

1020
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:13,759
cobalt for fixing atmospheric

1021
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,920
denitrification into ammonia

1022
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,000
providing plants with a essential

1023
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,000
macronutrient nitrogen

1024
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,079
so i'm not a consumer conspiracy

1025
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,159
theorist but this is starting to sound

1026
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,480
like a conspiracy now listen to what i

1027
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:30,159
just said a second ago cobalt is

1028
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,400
required it is the one of the required

1029
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:35,199
elements to to turn

1030
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,400
the gas in the atmosphere into usable

1031
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:38,319
nitrogen

1032
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,440
so but they don't say it's an essential

1033
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,320
mineral

1034
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,639
like

1035
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,800
but the chemists know this you know if

1036
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,879
you really think about that if you could

1037
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,119
add a trace mineral in so that you

1038
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,960
wouldn't have to use another something

1039
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,440
you have to purchase to keep more money

1040
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,039
in your pocket but they call this a

1041
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,559
beneficial mineral versus an essential

1042
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,000
mineral

1043
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:59,519
this is where i begin to think about

1044
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,280
things differently

1045
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:04,480
cobalt plays a vital role in the

1046
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,839
integration with iron nickel and zinc

1047
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,079
and maintaining cellular homeostasis

1048
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:13,759
similar to other micronutrients plants

1049
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:16,480
respond to cobalt concentrations in soil

1050
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,440
at low concentrations it promotes plant

1051
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,920
growth

1052
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,679
but it causes photos toxicity at higher

1053
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,480
concentrations so let's talk about

1054
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:27,279
nickel another beneficial nutrient

1055
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,639
nickel is used 10 times less than

1056
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,880
malignant

1057
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:33,440
nickel is a component for some plant

1058
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,640
enzymes most notably

1059
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,440
urease which metabolizes urea nitrogen

1060
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:42,239
into usable ammonia within the plant

1061
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,320
without nickel toxic levels of urea can

1062
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,399
accumulate within the tissue forming

1063
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,119
necrotic lesions in the leaves

1064
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,960
so

1065
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,760
again think about that for a second

1066
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,920
right

1067
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,480
there they sell

1068
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,440
farmers urea perfectly knowing that the

1069
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,559
plant can't take it up can't utilize it

1070
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,679
and then the plant says okay guys

1071
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:06,799
if you just give me a tiny bit of nickel

1072
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:09,279
and a little bit of biology i can turn

1073
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,079
your trash that you're giving me into

1074
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,079
something usable

1075
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:17,358
i find that to be incredibly interesting

1076
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,799
i i realized that at that point bacteria

1077
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:21,199
is capable of

1078
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,440
of evolving in its current environment

1079
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,919
even even though urea is a synthetic

1080
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,960
fertilizer it's still capable of

1081
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,920
processing it recent studies have shown

1082
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,320
that nickel degrades a potent cytotoxin

1083
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,960
compound naturally produced by cellular

1084
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,480
metabolism which is produced during

1085
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,280
stress and that would make sense right

1086
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,358
you give it a urea what happens plants

1087
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,000
stretch well

1088
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:48,319
the nickel helps detox that as the the

1089
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,960
plants going through rapid cellular

1090
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,760
metal metabolism so if you are using

1091
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,838
urea i would highly recommend to

1092
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,119
use some type of foliar spray or

1093
00:39:55,838 --> 00:39:58,559
implement it in nickel and if you're

1094
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,599
wondering nickels and drops of balance

1095
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:01,920
it is

1096
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,160
examining this role of nickel in the

1097
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,880
relationship to stress suggests

1098
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:09,358
that nickel may have a key participation

1099
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,318
in plant antioxidant metabolism

1100
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:14,400
so nickel basically helps detox a plant

1101
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:16,400
and the picture i found here really just

1102
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,240
shows it very well right if you are

1103
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,318
giving too much nitrogen what happens

1104
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:22,399
with the leaves it is dark green and

1105
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:24,719
that's all these free radicals flowing

1106
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,960
into the leaf well nick will helps detox

1107
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:29,279
that into a healthier green

1108
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,039
nickel is important for seed germination

1109
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,000
so chris you you do your own chin eggs

1110
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:33,199
right

1111
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,800
nickel would be

1112
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:35,919
so important for you if you do see

1113
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,000
germination

1114
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,720
nickel is also important for bacteria

1115
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,519
and fungi nickel behaves a largely like

1116
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:46,078
zinc in the soil plant system but it

1117
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:48,719
forms strong chelates with with soil

1118
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,920
organic matter thereby showing closeness

1119
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:52,399
to copper

1120
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,720
all because it has a divalent

1121
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,720
and a trivalent property so remember

1122
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:58,799
we're talking about a divalent can hold

1123
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:00,559
on to two other smaller minerals or two

1124
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,359
other minerals that have the opposite

1125
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:04,799
charge well nickel doesn't just have a

1126
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,199
divalent

1127
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,800
property it also has a trivalent

1128
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,279
property so it can hold on to three

1129
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,839
other minerals but it's used ten times

1130
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,000
less than malignant yet it can hold on

1131
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:18,639
to three other things

1132
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,318
i find that to be once again absolutely

1133
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,639
fascinating

1134
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,800
excess nickel also affects nutrient

1135
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:27,679
absorption by roots impairs plant

1136
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,079
metabolism inhibits photosynthesis and

1137
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:34,480
transportation and may also show signs

1138
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:36,000
of sucroses and or necrosis but that's

1139
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,920
not always the case

1140
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,199
flowers are often deformed under these

1141
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,639
conditions

1142
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:45,039
and for nickel deficiency seeds uh seeds

1143
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:47,920
that i don't have nickel

1144
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:50,318
normally won't pop they they're just

1145
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,519
inviable and if they do pop the more

1146
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:53,440
than likely you're not going to be able

1147
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:56,239
to bring in a yield and again this is

1148
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,720
just by a nickel deficiency

1149
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:00,799
that's not a beneficial element it they

1150
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:03,439
call it it's not an essential element

1151
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,280
it's a beneficial element actually i

1152
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,519
think it was

1153
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,359
20 years ago or something was enacted as

1154
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:11,199
an essential element

1155
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:13,279
so it's the newest one yeah there's 17

1156
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:15,759
essential elements nickel is the most

1157
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,920
recent one which around 20 years ago i

1158
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,200
believe it was added as an essential

1159
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,480
element so i appreciate that thank you i

1160
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:24,639
thank you so much for correcting me on

1161
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,240
that i love i love it when people point

1162
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,318
things out and i love learning so thanks

1163
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:30,559
again regrets for that so

1164
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:32,559
silicon it's a it's a beneficial element

1165
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,880
right not essential now you got me going

1166
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:37,679
non-chicken correct yeah yeah just

1167
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,519
beneficial non-essential cool okay so

1168
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,598
silicon and if i say

1169
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:44,239
uh silicone

1170
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,519
i don't i mean silicon i have like 20

1171
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:47,759
years of construction behind me so

1172
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:51,039
sometimes i say silicon

1173
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,960
or silicone i mean anyways so silicon is

1174
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:56,800
a beneficial non-mobile nutrient

1175
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:59,519
microorganisms like burke holia or

1176
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,480
batillus and other bacterias solidifies

1177
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:05,280
different types of silica silicates

1178
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,240
silicon benefits plants when under

1179
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,720
stress

1180
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:11,679
it improves drought tolerance and delays

1181
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:13,919
wilting in crops enhances the ability to

1182
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:16,559
resist micronutrients and other metal

1183
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,599
toxicities like aluminum copper iron

1184
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:21,519
manganese and zinc and etc so just kind

1185
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,119
of point this out right there's a

1186
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,440
mineral

1187
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,039
within all the other minerals

1188
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,720
because how do you how do you regulate

1189
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:30,719
the trace minerals that they're so small

1190
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:32,719
right well silicon if it's in an

1191
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:34,799
environment will will hold on to the

1192
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:37,039
excess trace minerals so they don't

1193
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,280
become toxic to your environment

1194
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:41,440
once again find that to be absolutely

1195
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,760
amazing how perfect the world we live in

1196
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:47,440
if we don't mess with it too much

1197
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,920
silicon enhances growth and yield of all

1198
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,159
annual vegetable crops promotes upright

1199
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,760
growth stronger and thicker stems and

1200
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:55,838
shorter internodes

1201
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,520
provides resistance to bacterial and

1202
00:43:55,838 --> 00:44:00,880
fungal diseases

1203
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:02,800
decreases some ana antibiotic stresses

1204
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,000
as temperature

1205
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,760
silica

1206
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
which is different than silicon and

1207
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,680
silicon is silica silica's processed

1208
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,159
silicon

1209
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,919
is often alkaline by nature because of

1210
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,519
the pro of what it does to make it

1211
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,440
soluble therefore naturally it's going

1212
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:18,800
to increase the ph and so what you're

1213
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,480
going to want to do if you're using a

1214
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,599
liquid silica you're going to want to

1215
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,159
add that first ph your your water and

1216
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,760
then then add in your trace minerals

1217
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:29,598
like drops of balance and then the rest

1218
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,599
if you're wondering if silicon is in

1219
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,000
drops balance it is and it's in an

1220
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,559
acidic form not an alkaline form

1221
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,960
silicon promotes light exposure and of

1222
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:40,960
leaves and makes an enormous difference

1223
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,358
in trichome production

1224
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,559
trichomes are mostly silicon

1225
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:49,039
trichomes play a role as a light wave

1226
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:51,199
guide for the far infrared silicon

1227
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:52,960
particles helps far infrared light

1228
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:54,639
efficiently propagate inside the

1229
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,480
trichomes and leaves

1230
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:59,279
these properties are useful for

1231
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,280
efficiently warming the plant since

1232
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,720
absorption of far infrared lights is

1233
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,760
converted to heat

1234
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:09,039
this is due to the photonic bandage and

1235
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,119
which the velocity of light slows

1236
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:13,519
in other words silicon gives structure

1237
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:16,079
to light as it enters and enhances the

1238
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:18,318
reflection and absorption of light

1239
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,318
therefore plants to form trichomes in

1240
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:23,039
order to efficiently

1241
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:25,599
capture far infrared light

1242
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:27,599
which would be useful for for the

1243
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,760
enhancement of photosynthesis

1244
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:33,760
and if i didn't explain that well enough

1245
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,839
just to kind of recap on this

1246
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,680
light is fast and it's coming through

1247
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:40,159
your your plant really fast if you have

1248
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:41,279
silicon it will actually slow the light

1249
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:44,000
down

1250
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,680
capture it better and efficiently guide

1251
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,480
it to where it needs to go

1252
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:50,480
that's what silicon does and so i for me

1253
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,960
i don't would i don't understand that

1254
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,039
how you could ever be efficient with all

1255
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,880
the lights that you're using with the in

1256
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:58,719
repaint that reoccurring build like

1257
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,039
wouldn't it be cooler if you captured

1258
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:02,719
more of that light in your plant that's

1259
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:04,719
it's that's what i think at least you

1260
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:07,598
could do that with silicon i think

1261
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:08,959
silicon is one of the most undervalued

1262
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,280
nutrients

1263
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,480
out there i mean you covered so many

1264
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,400
benefits

1265
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,639
one of the main ones is trichome

1266
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,960
production if you look at i believe it's

1267
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:22,239
an electron microscope and you look at a

1268
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:25,440
trichome on a plant that wasn't

1269
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:27,598
fed silica versus what was fed silica

1270
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,838
you see a massive difference in just the

1271
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,200
structure of the trichome alone a lot of

1272
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:33,440
people don't know that and if you are

1273
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:35,598
going to supplement silica a couple

1274
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,679
things to know you want silicic acid or

1275
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,519
orthosilicic acid those are the

1276
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:42,078
bioavailable forms

1277
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:43,599
silicon dioxide is not a bioavailable

1278
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,720
form so let's forget to add those few

1279
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,160
things in

1280
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:48,719
all right i love that you brought that

1281
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:51,358
up chris because if you want long-term

1282
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:53,279
bag appeal with a great nose

1283
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:54,960
you're going to use silicon right it's

1284
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,040
being like what we talked about more

1285
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,519
those trichomes are made mostly of

1286
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:01,199
silicon so if they had more of that

1287
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:02,960
structure when they're finished off do

1288
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,879
you think they'll be able to retain

1289
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,599
those terpenes and those oils a little

1290
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:10,720
better versus breaking off or or

1291
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:12,240
floating away this this so this is like

1292
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:13,598
we all know this right it's like you

1293
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:15,279
look at your buddies herb and you're

1294
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,000
like how old is that and you're like a

1295
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,800
year last year was a crop and like damn

1296
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,639
how did it looks amazing right that's

1297
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,720
because they're using the right

1298
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:27,118
essential minerals to so that the plant

1299
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:29,519
can do with the bacteria so that they

1300
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,039
can produce the enzymes needed to do its

1301
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:32,719
full potential and like i was saying

1302
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:35,838
right they they call these essential

1303
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:38,000
minerals versus beneficial but we're not

1304
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:39,838
because we eat our food quickly and

1305
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,079
because though things get thrown away

1306
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:43,920
quickly and a lot of herbs we a lot of

1307
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,960
people don't see the preservation of

1308
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:49,838
herbs long term right and if you if we

1309
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,720
if if you're taking care of of a crop

1310
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:54,318
from one year versus the of let's say

1311
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:56,000
you have two different crops and you see

1312
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:57,519
you use one with bacteria that has the

1313
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,920
right enzymes the versus the other one

1314
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:02,318
that doesn't the one that the one the

1315
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,800
the where you see the difference is a

1316
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:06,639
year later where you're still able to

1317
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,200
sell your crop versus the other one it's

1318
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:11,440
already started to degrade and that and

1319
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:13,199
you don't we don't acknowledge it

1320
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,240
because it's not now

1321
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:18,558
but if we but we are capable of seeing

1322
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:20,000
it long term we do see the benefit and

1323
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,519
these are because of different enzymatic

1324
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
production different enzymes being

1325
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:25,199
produced at different times

1326
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,119
selenium

1327
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:29,759
selenium is considered a beneficial

1328
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:32,800
element for higher plants enhancing

1329
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:35,280
antioxidant metabolism photosynthesis

1330
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,119
secondary metabolites and carbohydrates

1331
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,359
in plant leaves

1332
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,440
at low concentration selenium enhances

1333
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:43,759
photosynthesis in plants due to

1334
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,480
increasing protection of light

1335
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:49,280
harvesting proteins and photosynthesis

1336
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,039
pigments called antani complex right and

1337
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,920
we're talking about enzymes and proteins

1338
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:54,079
right

1339
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,400
you need all these things bacteria and

1340
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,960
selenium are closely interlinked as the

1341
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,440
element serves both essential nutrient

1342
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,720
requirements and energy generation

1343
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,960
functions

1344
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:08,000
however selenium at high levels can be

1345
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,039
toxic for bacterial homeostasis selenium

1346
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,599
and nickel

1347
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:12,960
help detox plant inflammation and that's

1348
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,800
what we're talking about before free

1349
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,519
radicals dark green is going to bring it

1350
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:20,000
back to being a healthy grain

1351
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:22,239
titanium titanium is a semi-mobile

1352
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,239
beneficial element titanium applied via

1353
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:26,399
roots or leaves at low concentrations

1354
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,558
have been documented to improve crop

1355
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,760
performance through stimulating the

1356
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:34,640
activity of certain enzymes enhancing

1357
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:37,280
chlorophyll content and photosynthesis

1358
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:39,838
promoting nutrient uptake strengthening

1359
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,680
stress tolerance and improving crop

1360
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:43,838
yield and quality

1361
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:46,159
it is considered a biostimulant for

1362
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:49,519
improving crop production titanium's

1363
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:52,239
role in plants lies in its interaction

1364
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:54,800
with other trace nutrient elements

1365
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:57,039
primarily iron iron and titanium have a

1366
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,079
synergistic and antigonistic

1367
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:03,119
relationship when plants experience

1368
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:06,160
iron deficiencies titanium helps induce

1369
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,318
the expression of genes related to iron

1370
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:11,920
thereby enhancing iron's uptake and

1371
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:14,400
utilization and improving plant growth

1372
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,639
so let me explain this a little better

1373
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,519
let's say we uh we have a tank of gas

1374
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:21,679
and we hold 10 gallons we use up nine we

1375
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:24,400
have one left and imagine you were

1376
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:27,440
capable of pushing a button to make your

1377
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:30,720
engine engine more sensitive so that one

1378
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,318
gallon actually acted like 10 gallons of

1379
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:34,480
gasoline

1380
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:37,199
that's what titanium does it makes

1381
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,280
everything more hypersensitive so if

1382
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:41,199
there's a deficiency or there's not

1383
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,440
enough in the environment it will make

1384
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:45,679
it enough

1385
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,760
i find that to be once again for soil

1386
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:49,759
that's incredibly depleted i find

1387
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,319
titanium should be a an essential

1388
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,000
mineral versus a beneficial titanium if

1389
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:56,159
you're wondering is also in drops of

1390
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,639
balance the big question

1391
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:59,759
how do i start applying this knowledge

1392
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,838
today

1393
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,839
we have to go from academics to

1394
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:05,199
application i just shared all this

1395
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:06,719
knowledge right

1396
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:08,719
we have to we have to go we have to

1397
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:10,480
remember that knowledge is not power it

1398
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:12,959
is the application of knowledge that's

1399
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,119
power so we go back to the five most

1400
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,559
limiting factors that support enzyme

1401
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,800
production

1402
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,119
one your carbon and your humic layer in

1403
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,119
your soil and so your carbon and your

1404
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,640
humic layer is pit moss like i was

1405
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:27,838
telling you it's these fibrous little

1406
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:29,519
paper that acts as as a net that keeps

1407
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:30,960
things in places because if you're using

1408
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:34,000
cocoa or

1409
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,159
or sphagnum peat moss all these things

1410
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,400
the way they're processed kind of hold

1411
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:41,039
differently and so when you put your

1412
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,960
when you put in the the your nutrients a

1413
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:44,800
lot of these nutrients was if using dry

1414
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,880
metals will actually fall to the bottom

1415
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,359
because they're not being captured very

1416
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,519
well in the media so once again pip moss

1417
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:53,759
is your carbon and it's your future home

1418
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:55,759
for your microbes and minerals and why

1419
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,480
is because the microbes and the minerals

1420
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,960
need a full 24 hours for those those

1421
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,440
minerals and those bacteria staying

1422
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:06,559
undisturbed in that environment for 24

1423
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:09,039
hours to do to create those enzymes

1424
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:10,640
two you need clean and consistent

1425
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:12,558
watering practices

1426
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:14,799
so clean is what drops balance drops

1427
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:17,040
balance cleans over 400 separate

1428
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,960
separate man-made chemicals

1429
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:21,119
in your consistent watering practices

1430
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,720
well because of the pit moss remember no

1431
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,440
more than five percent in your media to

1432
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:27,598
start it's paper so it acts as a wicking

1433
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,000
system throughout your entire media

1434
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:32,240
helping to rebuild your humic layer so

1435
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,639
once you get your compost compost going

1436
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:37,279
and and reinmenting your soil

1437
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:39,598
it it just helps start that process and

1438
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,839
keeps things together

1439
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,318
three ionic sulfate trace minerals

1440
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:48,000
that's drops balance 64 plus ionic

1441
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:50,558
sulfate trace minerals four your biology

1442
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,280
tear organics it has 80 separate

1443
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,599
bacteria colonies endo fungi we

1444
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,760
recommend and support recharge or

1445
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,079
extreme gardening they're mycos and then

1446
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,920
last but not least is your co2 which is

1447
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,039
organic shield obviously if you have a

1448
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,480
bug problem you need something that's

1449
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:06,239
going to kill the bugs immediately the

1450
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,000
organic shield does that but when it

1451
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:10,239
breaks down

1452
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,719
into into having no residual it has

1453
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:15,759
breaks down to water co2 and sugar which

1454
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:18,639
is your fifth most limiting factor

1455
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,960
okay so let's wrap this up in and

1456
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:23,598
understand why is this significant right

1457
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,800
well photosynthesis what do you actually

1458
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,039
need

1459
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,920
for photosynthesis to do their job to do

1460
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:32,880
its job you need co2

1461
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:37,119
water magnesium iron

1462
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:41,200
manganese nitrogen zinc titanium silicon

1463
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:42,960
nickel cobalt malignant sulfur and

1464
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:45,039
bacteria

1465
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,639
you have that your photosynthesis is

1466
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:48,400
going to do its job and it's going to do

1467
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:50,558
it to the best of its ability if you're

1468
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,000
missing one of these things

1469
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,760
i promise you you're not going to see

1470
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,519
the full potential of the plants and how

1471
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,400
you measure that is in the terpene

1472
00:53:55,519 --> 00:54:00,960
profiles at the end of your grow

1473
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,000
let's go to the next most the next one

1474
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,679
that you should really pay attention to

1475
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,440
the first one was capturing the light

1476
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:07,118
right the next one is your ipm your

1477
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,119
integrated pest management because bugs

1478
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,599
can really do damage and wouldn't it be

1479
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,920
nice if you you have the ability to add

1480
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,838
in the right things

1481
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,358
bugs wouldn't be attracted to to your

1482
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:19,920
plants because

1483
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:21,920
the the leading reason why they think

1484
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,639
bugs are actually attracted to plants is

1485
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:27,599
because of excess enzymes

1486
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:29,118
on those plants and why is that

1487
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,079
well it's because bugs actually don't

1488
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,680
have a

1489
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,519
the ability to

1490
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,039
produce enzymes they don't have their

1491
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:37,199
own digestive enzymes so they actually

1492
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:38,558
have to go rob them from another place

1493
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:40,159
to do their job and that would make

1494
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,920
sense right nature is trying to create a

1495
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:44,318
situation for

1496
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:47,119
to clean up its own mess

1497
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:49,440
so how do you fix this well you fix this

1498
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:52,240
by by giving the plant what it needs so

1499
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,760
it can complete its 24 hour cycle of

1500
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:55,118
their enzyme production so what do you

1501
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,200
actually need

1502
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,760
so your plants are less attractive well

1503
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:02,318
you need magnesium you need sulfur you

1504
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,000
need malignant you need boron you need

1505
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:07,039
sugar

1506
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,358
selenium and nickel and bacteria

1507
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:10,318
all staying in the same spot for 24

1508
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:12,639
hours

1509
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:14,639
and if you did that there's a very good

1510
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:15,440
chance you're probably never going to

1511
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:17,598
have

1512
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,760
a bug breakout you'll probably still

1513
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,359
have some bugs

1514
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,799
but for the most part they're they're

1515
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:25,358
not going to be attracted to your crop

1516
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:27,759
they'll be attracted to your buddies

1517
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:30,000
scientists try to replace bacteria and

1518
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,359
say they are creating the same amount of

1519
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,519
enzymes

1520
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:34,960
what do you think i'm confused no i'm

1521
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:37,519
just kidding

1522
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,440
a lot of good information there some of

1523
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:40,719
these essential elements some

1524
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,960
non-essential elements but are

1525
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:44,959
beneficial elements you definitely did a

1526
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,119
great job with this presentation and i'm

1527

1535
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,880
the perfect gardens youtube channel

1536
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,160
always helps and if you guys ever want a

1537
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,960
part three

1538
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:13,358
uh just let me know i could definitely i

1539
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,119
love this subject about gardening and i

1540
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:17,199
could definitely make a

1541
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,559
part three about something new and

1542
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:20,399
interesting if you're interested just

1543
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,319
leave a comment down below

1544
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,798
yeah i think between the part one and

1545
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:27,920
part two we covered all of the essential

1546
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:29,838
elements except for chlorine carbon

1547
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,680
hydrogen and oxygen so i might have to

1548
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:33,679
drag you back for a part three so we

1549
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:35,598
could we could finish up the essential

1550
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:37,039
elements i know there's a lot more

1551
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,640
non-essential elements that we could

1552
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:41,199
potentially cover in the future as well

1553
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:43,838
so if you want a part three comment down

1554
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:46,239
below right part three and uh maybe we

1555
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:48,000
get mark back for part three mark thank

1556
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:50,399
you so much for coming on to the podcast

1557
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,838
once again this has been awesome i've

1558
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,639
learned so much this is one that i'm

1559
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:55,920
gonna look back at and continue to learn

1560
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:57,519
more and more and more every time i

1561
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,400
watch it because it's a lot of

1562
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:00,318
information

1563
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,838
really tough to absorb it all in one run

1564
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:03,119
basically impossible to absorb all in

1565
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:05,679
one run unless you're one of those

1566
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:08,079
people who have a sponge for a brain

1567
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:09,519
it can't absorb it all in one run

1568
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:12,000
but uh this is something that is

1569
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:14,400
definitely going to be on the rerun i i

1570
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,760
agree with you man this this this is an

1571
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,318
incredibly

1572
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,359
uh confusing and complex topic and

1573
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:21,358
that's why

1574
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:23,598
i really tried to break it down to say

1575
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:25,598
hey listen guys the most limited liberty

1576
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,880
law minimum your most limiting factor in

1577
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,200
your garden for especially a

1578
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,599
biologically alive garden is enzyme

1579
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:33,199
production and instead of trying to get

1580
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:35,280
complex in the knowledge i tried to say

1581
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:38,000
hey listen these are the products out

1582
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,839
there that are going to solve 80 of your

1583
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,280
