1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,040
coming up on garden talk there is so

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,639
many different chemical constituents

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,080
that plants construct

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:12,239
to manipulate their environment in soil

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,519
whether it be the biological populations

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,800
whether it be ph

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,439
in the rhizosphere all of these things

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,640
are all part of it over watering can

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,559
look like so

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,080
many different things and what's

11
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,799
happening is

12
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,879
you're creating an environment and where

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,160
bacteria that isn't conducive to the

14
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,039
health of your plant

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,880
is able to colonize and grow a lot of

16
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,799
the bacillus species

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,359
they have the ability to encapsulate

18
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:42,000
their dna into an endospore

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,039
and those endospores they create like a

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,238
wax coating

21
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,640
they're really resilient there are so

22
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:48,799
many

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,000
products out there that are so

24
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,679
overpriced

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,840
or have such small colony forming units

26
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:59,840
that they're going to be uneffective

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,198
what's up everybody if you that don't

28

some of the things that we talk about in

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,560
this episode are ideal soil temperature

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,079
for microbe activity

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,680
we talk about large swings that can

45
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,000
happen in the micro population

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,960
the rate of microbe reproduction and a

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,719

111
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,840
how you got into gardening

112
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,759
sure my name is brandon rust i'm from

113
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,360
san diego but i currently reside in

114
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,719
oklahoma

115
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,680
i started cultivating medicinal plants

116
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:49,680
20 years ago i was a teenager 18 19

117
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,120
years old and i had uh

118
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,360
some og some older guys uh show me

119
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,200
how to cultivate uh back then we were

120
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,959
doing hydroponics

121
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,719
i've since moved to doing living organic

122
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,759
systems

123
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,519
and if you guys are interested in any of

124
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,959
the the work that i do

125
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:14,158
you can find me at rust.brandon

126
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,000
and you can find you know

127
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,279
links there to my company bokashi

128
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,120
earthworks which is a biological

129
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,039
fertilizer company i specialize in

130
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,280
microbial inoculants

131
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,840
for nutrient cycling soil health and

132
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:29,039
fertility and integrated pest management

133
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:32,560
and then i also own a 40 acre farm

134
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,400
uh out here in oklahoma with my partners

135
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,839
awesome and then i actually googled your

136
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,719
dame before we met up today

137
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,560
and i think the third link down if you

138
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,479
google his name brandon rust the third

139
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,399
link down goes to herbage

140
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,560
mag and there's actually a written

141
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,839
article about you kind of your story so

142
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,240
if anybody's watching this wants to

143
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,399
learn the next level down about his

144
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,680
journey here over the past 20 years

145
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,439
is definitely a good read it's only

146
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,560
about a page long so

147
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:01,918
but definitely worth the read for sure

148
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,959
cool so i think it's appropriate to just

149
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:04,799
start with

150
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,560
the soil food web you know that's

151
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,720
actually something that

152
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,120
hasn't been discussed yet on my garden

153
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,039
talk podcast off of any of the guests

154
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,038
so let's start with that maybe if you

155
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:15,839
could take you know roughly five minutes

156
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:17,918
or however long

157
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,079
it takes to kind of talk to us about

158
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,240
what the food web is and

159
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,439
somewhat a basic or beginner friendly

160
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,918
type way

161
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,759
sure i'm sure that most of your viewers

162
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:31,279
are familiar with

163
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,840
you know the food web something that we

164
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,879
got to see in elementary school you know

165
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,519
what eats what

166
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,918
what's higher up in the food chain soil

167
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:43,680
food web is that same exact thing

168
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:47,918
for the soil and the species

169
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,519
that interact the way that they you know

170
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:53,599
release mineral nutrients and it's

171
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,120
basically just the the diversity of

172
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,400
different

173
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,918
types of microorganisms micro and meso

174
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,159
fauna

175
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:07,079
um and then macro uh

176
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,880
macro uh flora and fauna as well as

177
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,240
arthropods

178
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:14,240
earthworms so you know it's a it's

179
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,400
it's complicated but really it's it's

180
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,560
not it's basically just

181
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,478
that there are certain things that do

182
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,439
certain things

183
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,839
in the soil and they feed off of each

184
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,399
other

185
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,679
they work you know synergistically and

186
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,038
symbiotically

187
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,160
with each other basically it is the

188
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:36,159
the web of life that perpetuates

189
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,600
life and that's all we're going to be

190
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,039
talking all about microbes today so

191
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,479
we're going to talk about the biology

192
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,318
uh we are going to definitely get into a

193
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:45,038
little bit of chemistry here

194
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,879
um which has warned everybody i'm a

195
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,240
beginner when it comes to chemistry so

196
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:49,918
some of the stuff actually might go over

197
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,199
my head which it might go over so my

198
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,560
audience had as well

199
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,319
but it's okay because we can always look

200
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,280
back we can always do additional

201
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,400
research

202
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,918
and so on and so forth so it goes over

203
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,239
my head

204
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,359
i consider myself a really intelligent

205
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,160
person i read

206
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,000
tons of white papers i read literature

207
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,840
all the time

208
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,199
the complexity of these systems

209
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,239
is to be able to really have a firm

210
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,520
understanding

211
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,680
you have to have a really good

212
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,399
imagination

213
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,000
yeah absolutely so chemistry and then

214
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,839
you get into like biochemistry

215
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,439
and then you get into you know we might

216
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,799
even touch on linux

217
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:32,240
yep you know so much it's endless almost

218
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,879
it really is and that's one of the

219
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,038
reasons that you know soil science

220
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,399
is so intriguing is because there will

221
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:40,079
never be a point

222
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,839
where i come and say oh i can't learn

223
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,918
anymore

224
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,239
it'll always be a journey so i'm just

225
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:49,439
taking people along with me as i go

226
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,800
and that's what makes it fun for sure so

227
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:55,680
a lot of my audience does use synthetic

228
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,079
fertilizers right synthetic nutrients

229
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,000
and

230
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,680
we often hear about salt buildup

231
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,038
resulting in problems now when we're

232
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,879
talking about salt

233
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,800
we're not talking about sodium chloride

234
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,319
right the table salt

235
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,038
uh so what exactly tell us what exactly

236
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,879
is salt from like a chemistry standpoint

237
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:16,639
well when we're looking at

238
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,000
typically when we are looking at these

239
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:24,079
systems in soil anyway we are looking at

240
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,240
chloride and sodium na

241
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:29,839
what happens is there are certain

242
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,360
chemicals that are biologically

243
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,319
available for the plants

244
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,399
to utilize for the specific functions

245
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,240
whatever they may be for

246
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,000
in these natural systems you have what's

247
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,680
called oxidation and redox

248
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,559
potentials and essentially certain

249
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,519
elements are biologically available and

250
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,838
we see this like

251
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:54,399
for in ph right but there's more to it

252
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,240
we see it in ph and that is going to be

253
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,600
certain things are available

254
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,120
there's a bigger picture to that

255
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,800
and typically when you're using

256
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,200
synthetics

257
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,159
they're taking a chemical that can be

258
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,120
absorbed

259
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,399
by a plant but it's also in a chemical

260
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,600
formulation

261
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,080
to where it's not going to

262
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,639
um where it's not going to be affected

263
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,680
by

264
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:23,759
the oxidation and redox potentials

265
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:26,799
of those systems so

266
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,799
inherently you have kind of

267
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,039
a dual you have two systems right these

268
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,359
organic systems which

269
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,278
you know we still use things like

270
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,919
mineral salts

271
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,039
but they're not synthetically created

272
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:43,120
right the ones

273
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:46,480
when you're you can get the same effect

274
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:51,200
with with either but what happens

275
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:56,159
is with synthetic

276
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,879
fertilizers you're human accumulating

277
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,278
a lot of chemical compounds that are

278
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,039
going to

279
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:04,958
interfere and have antagonistic

280
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,879
relationships with what you're trying to

281
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:10,799
absorb

282
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,759
right and also oftentimes these

283
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,958
chemicals are in

284
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:18,559
such high quantity that they are

285
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:21,838
are grossly over applied

286
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:26,958
when you grossly over apply a synthetic

287
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:30,240
fertilizer it can adversely affect

288
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:33,278
the biology of that soil

289
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,720
but it can also affect

290
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:39,759
the abiotic nature of that soil

291
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,440
which is anything that's not related

292
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,200
all the different stress factors that

293
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,800
could be that aren't related with

294
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,000
biology

295
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:51,679
so like the weathering when you have

296
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,839
those types of chemicals they can tie up

297
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,120
soil they can tie up nutrient they can

298
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,399
cause

299
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,200
anaerobic conditions when they uh they

300
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,480
dry out

301
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,720
really uh easier

302
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,320
they don't hold moisture as well so you

303
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,720
have different conditions

304
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,560
that eventually accumulate and it's not

305
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,120
to say that this can't happen also in

306
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:17,679
organic systems because it totally can

307
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:23,200
you can accumulate things

308
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:23,199
like chloride and sodium

309
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:29,200
in these inorganic systems as well

310
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,720
and they'll compile and again what it

311
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,680
does is causes antagonistic

312
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,360
relationships

313
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:37,679
it hinders microbiology from being able

314
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,200
to procreate and reproduce

315
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:43,838
and it also comes at a great cost

316
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,440
to environment in the production of

317
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,160
those chemicals

318
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,560
gotcha now i guess one of the ways that

319
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,319
i was kind of explaining and

320
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,879
to try to make it a little bit simpler

321
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,079
terms i guess you could say

322
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,519
is you know when you have these bulb

323
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:58,239
nutrients you're mixing it with water

324
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,560
it's

325
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,000
somewhat like binding to that h2o it's

326
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,879
going into the soil right

327
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,399
and then the plant is uptaking it or

328
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,000
it's staying there and the water is

329
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,958
evaporating and then you have what's

330
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
left over is an

331
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:14,958
ion i believe and then that ion isn't

332
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,320
available to be uptaken by the plant

333
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:20,719
so my question is are microbes able

334
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,680
to access that ion at that point and eat

335
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,720
that ion

336
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:28,000
or when you have a

337
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:32,399
when you have a large accumulation

338
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,600
of antagonistic

339
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,720
cations in your soil

340
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,759
it's going to make it so the plant can

341
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,879
absorb that

342
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:46,159
bacteria microorganisms

343
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:49,519
fungi yeast they all have

344
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:51,439
amazing abilities to

345
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,039
break down almost anything that is a

346
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,240
hydrocarbon compound

347
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:58,719
so if it is you know i guess

348
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,399
any or anything in organic chemistry

349
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,839
because i guess organic chemistry it

350
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,559
doesn't necessarily

351
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,920
have to be natural in nature they can be

352
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:07,838
synthetic but when we're talking about

353
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,319
organic chemistry we're talking about

354
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,600
anything that is a hydrocarbon

355
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,959
compound that being said

356
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,639
there is a microbe for

357
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:22,399
every compound because the amount of

358
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,079
microbes that we have

359
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:28,320
vary in such a huge specie of diversity

360
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:30,399
and when we're thinking about at least

361
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,680
when i'm thinking about microbes

362
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,639
i'm thinking of it kind of like

363
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,359
varieties of medicinal plants some will

364
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,759
have

365
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,759
a lot of different effects right

366
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,360
because of the metabolites that they're

367
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,199
producing or the

368
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,639
the chemical constituents that those

369
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,278
plants produce

370
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,639
microorganisms are very similar in that

371
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,198
they all produce

372
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,639
different chemical constituents some of

373
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:00,399
these these are their secondary

374
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:04,079
metabolites just like the plants produce

375
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:07,679
so what we'll see is there are some

376
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,559
bacteria like uh phosphorus solubilizing

377
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,319
bacteria

378
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:15,838
they release an enzyme that's able to

379
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,720
release phosphate the only plant

380
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:22,720
available source of phosphorus

381
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,759
from inorganic mineral compounds

382
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,879
from rocks from things like

383
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:32,240
calcium phosphate or calcium bentonite

384
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:34,399
or uh you know

385
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,839
we'll ask tonight there's so many

386
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,078
different

387
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,920
types of calcium and when we're looking

388
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,838
at calcium

389
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:44,000
as a chemical we're not just looking at

390
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,880
ca right it's always attached to

391
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,360
something like

392
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:53,039
c-a-s-i-o you know calcium silica

393
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,600
or calcium phosphate or you know calcium

394
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,599
silicate

395
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:04,000
a lot of these elements that we use

396
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,720
in organic farming are usually attached

397
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,720
to something else all of the mineral

398
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,680
sulfates

399
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,000
it is a mineral it is considered a salt

400
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:16,000
right

401
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
because it's soluble in water

402
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:24,000
so you can take almost across the board

403
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,800
there is something for an organic

404
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,198
situation

405
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:29,278
if you need to make up for a deficit

406
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,198
that is immediately available

407
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,958
and i know that's you know i've heard

408
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:35,120
people say oh you can't

409
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,039
get things immediately in organics and

410
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,799
that's absolutely not true

411
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:41,120
there's a difference between what you're

412
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:44,559
putting in right if you're using

413
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,278
a mineral salt and organic mineral salt

414
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:50,159
you can do the same thing you can hamper

415
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:53,679
a system the same way you could

416
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:56,958
by over application in a

417
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:58,399
you know chemical system as well um

418
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,479
but when you're using something like a

419
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,879
meal anything that has a meal

420
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,079
attached to it whether it's feather meal

421
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,039
bone meal

422
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,359
kelp meal those are all things that

423
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,599
biology is going to have to utilize to

424
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,879
break down to release

425
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,800
into the system anything that has a

426
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,439
sulfate on the end of it

427
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,159
potassium sulfate iron sulfate zinc

428
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,959
sulfate

429
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,958
these are all mined minerals that come

430
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,879
out of deposits whether it was like in a

431
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:30,719
volcanic eruption

432
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:33,360
a natural seabed mine that dried out

433
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,360
rock quarry they're mine mineral

434
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,480
sulfates but they're water soluble or

435
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,519
they have more

436
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,440
solubility in water now they don't all

437
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:45,440
have the same solubility

438
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:50,000
right magnesium sulfate aka

439
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:53,279
epsom salt has a way higher solubility

440
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,639
than let's say calcium uh

441
00:16:53,278 --> 00:17:00,240
calcium sulfate or gypsum we're talking

442
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,240
about a huge huge difference

443
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,120
so you know when we're talking about

444
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,239
uh salts we're talking about things that

445
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,239
are soluble in water

446
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,438
which you have to be careful of too

447
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,759
because we're talking usually talking

448
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,199
about

449
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:19,279
a cat ion and there's three

450
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,720
there's four but there's three cations

451
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,838
that we're looking at

452
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,400
specifically for you know when we're

453
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:26,480
farming

454
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,439
and that's calcium magnesium and

455
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,880
potassium

456
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,440
there's also sodium n a but that's

457
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,080
antagonistic to all three of those

458
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,440
so we want sodium to always be as low as

459
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,639
possible because it's a

460
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,038
it is a salt it's a cation and it's

461
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,400
antagonistic and it'll cause

462
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:49,359
block out or lock out even if you have

463
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,798
adequate amounts of everything you need

464
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,159
in your soil let's say your soil is

465
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,079
perfectly healthy and

466
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,400
balanced well i guess it wouldn't be

467
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,558
balanced if your soil if your

468
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,919
sodium was up but let's say everything

469
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:01,759
else was good but your sodium

470
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,960
is really high what's going to hap

471
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,038
what's going to affect

472
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,038
what is mostly going to be affected are

473
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:07,440
those what are going to be affected are

474
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:09,599
those

475
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,600
major cations the thing the plant relies

476
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:15,439
on for the majority

477
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:17,119
of its biomechanical processes

478
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,600
gotcha that's very interesting stuff

479
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:22,159
there for sure now in some

480
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:24,159
organic gardening books it's mentioned

481
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,600
that feeding synthetic nutrients

482
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,519
are going to kill off the microbes

483
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:30,399
however on online sources

484
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:32,240
like there's this gardening myth website

485
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,759
it says that that's completely false

486
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,679
feeding in synthetic nutrients you're

487
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,759
actually feeding the microbes

488
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,720
so is it true that feeding synthetic

489
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:39,759
nutrients are going to kill off the

490
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,880
microbes

491
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,759
if so how fast do the micro populations

492
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,320
die off

493
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,240
when feeding these synthetic nutrients

494
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,240
well

495
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,319
so i don't have any actual data that's

496
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,160
going to say this is exactly

497
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,079
what is happening and you know i'm a

498
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:00,240
data driven uh

499
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:02,240
cultivator that's how i how i do uh

500
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,240
all of my agronomy i look at what's in

501
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,079
the soil and stuff

502
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:12,160
when it comes to biology

503
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:14,639
biology is it's it's pretty resilient

504
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,720
a lot of these species have the ability

505
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,799
to endosporolate which

506
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,120
encapsulates their dna and they can

507
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,319
survive in extreme conditions whether

508
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,119
it's

509
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:27,678
high or low ph ranges high and low

510
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:31,759
temperature ranges

511
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:34,880
and all different types of

512
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:38,160
abiotic and biotic stress factors

513
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,720
that being said it does hinder biology

514
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,200
when you're using a bunch of again

515
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,400
you're talking about

516
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,440
an organism's inability to use what it

517
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,360
needs what people

518
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,519
don't understand is that bacteria

519
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:54,719
microorganisms

520
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:57,279
are very similar to plants

521
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,919
i mean plants wouldn't exist if it

522
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,759
wasn't for

523
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,559
the relationships that they co-evolved

524
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:05,440
with with the different microorganisms

525
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,480
and the the microorganisms also require

526
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,000
a diet

527
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,319
right it's not just nitrogen and calcium

528
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
right they need iron they need manganese

529
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:17,439
they need a lot of the same

530
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,440
elements that plants need and again

531
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,038
if you go and throw a bunch of stuff

532
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,679
into a system that's not

533
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:25,440
balanced it's not just a plant that's

534
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,200
going to be adversely affected

535
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,759
it's going to be the biology of those

536
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:35,120
systems how can they

537
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:38,319
sequester any type of nutrient

538
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:41,599
if it's just downright not available

539
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:44,000
because there's this antagonistic

540
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,959
relationship going on does that make

541
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,960
sense

542
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:53,120
gotcha yep so not only that but

543
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:56,960
from my perspective and from you know

544
00:20:53,119 --> 00:21:01,038
what i've seen there are

545
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:04,480
certain species of microbes that can

546
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:08,960
tolerate those high salinity high saline

547
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:12,240
types of conditions but because

548
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,519
microorganisms are so fragile which is

549
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,919
kind of like

550
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,839
you know some species will be able to

551
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,480
survive those types of conditions what

552
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,639
are they

553
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,640
well you have to do your research we

554
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,640
know that certain species of bacillus

555
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,880
bacteria

556
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,960
are can still function really well in

557
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,880
high salinity conditions

558
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,960
we know that there are certain strains

559
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,919
of trichoderma

560
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,079
that do this there are there's like

561
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,200
microbes for [ __ ] everything

562
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:45,839
but when we're talking about specific

563
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:49,120
microbes that are that we're utilizing

564
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:53,038
in agriculture for

565
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:55,119
specific reason whether it's to

566
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,519
whether it's for their production of

567
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:01,199
selective target antibodies

568
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:04,319
or whether it's because we want them

569
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,120
to we're looking for an enzyme

570
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,599
production

571
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,719
that they produce we'll eliminate that

572
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:12,079
because we need to

573
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,759
we need to have conditions where we can

574
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:19,918
promote the types of microorganisms

575
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,919
that are going to boat that best

576
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,679
benefit that specie of plant

577
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:26,798
in the environment that it's in gotcha

578
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,880
that makes sense

579
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,798
and kind of piggybacking off of that

580
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,520
talking about getting into like large

581
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,639
swings in micro population that's never

582
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,480
a good thing right

583
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,880
you know generally they say that if

584
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,640
you're flushing your plant for example

585
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,440
you could be flushing out a lot of those

586
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,880
microbes if you're over fertilizing you

587
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,159
could be killing you know you could have

588
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,760
that large swing

589
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:52,080
in the population large ph fluctuations

590
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,519
is another thing that i've heard could

591
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,199
potentially

592
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:56,960
hinder you could have a large swing in

593
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,360
the micro population as well

594
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,079
are there anything else or yeah talk

595
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,199
about that stuff

596
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:06,480
a little bit so temperature

597
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,440
ph hydrology those are going to be your

598
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,480
three

599
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,519
main components when it comes to

600
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,440
which type of microorganisms are are

601
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:19,038
abundant in soil but also

602
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:22,159
plant species and

603
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:25,759
which type what kind of

604
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:28,240
of photosynthesis are they releasing

605
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:31,359
into the soil what type of eggs are they

606
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,120
because when we're talking about

607
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:36,959
plant exudates there are

608
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,798
there are there's the science that's

609
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,400
going to come out on this is going to be

610
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:44,079
[ __ ] insane dude there is so many

611
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,440
different chemical constituents that

612
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,879
plants construct

613
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,038
to manipulate their environment in soil

614
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,320
whether it be the biological populations

615
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:55,679
whether it be ph

616
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:59,119
in the rhizosphere all of these things

617
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,960
are all part of it if you go too low on

618
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:04,798
ph some species will completely die

619
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:08,960
off if you go too high if you're if you

620
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:10,879
over water and it goes anaerobic

621
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,960
and you don't have the proper biology to

622
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,120
start with

623
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,120
you could say goodbye you know there's

624
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,558
when we're talking about explosive

625
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:22,959
populations

626
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:24,558
you know let's say that your plant's not

627
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,120
let's say your plant's struggling a

628
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:27,759
little bit

629
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,759
right and you're like oh i can't figure

630
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:32,000
out what it is

631
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,879
i see this all time just from over

632
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,278
watering

633
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,400
over watering can look like so many

634
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:39,119
different things

635
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,200
and what's happening is you're creating

636
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,199
an environment and where

637
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,480
bacteria that isn't conducive to the

638
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,759
health of your plant

639
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,240
is able to colonize and grow so let's

640
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:49,919
say

641
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,919
that this is kind of like the beginning

642
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,080
right you have this thing happening

643
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,240
you didn't catch it and then you go like

644
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:57,038
you think it's a nitrogen deficiency so

645
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,200
you go

646
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,079
hit these things with a bunch of amino

647
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,480
acids right

648
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,678
like soy hydrolysate what you're going

649
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,440
to end up doing

650
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,600
is you're going to compile the problem

651
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,679
that you have because you just added a

652
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:13,839
complex carbohydrate

653
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,960
to a living soil system where the

654
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:18,879
predominant

655
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,440
microbe is something that's going to

656
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,278
kill your plant and you just gave them

657
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,038
something that they love

658
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:30,079
so it's those types of

659
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:33,278
i guess scenarios

660
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:34,000
that that biology can make a huge

661
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,200
difference

662
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,919
let's say you you have a root uh a

663
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,480
flat full of of clones that you're

664
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,720
rooting right and

665
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,200
you over water them and there they

666
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,159
become waterlogged right and all those

667
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,640
roots become

668
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,600
anaerobic man how long is it going to

669
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,919
take for

670
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,038
you to recover with that and then let's

671
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,600
say you go ahead

672
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:58,240
and plant those things and you're like

673
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,158
oh

674
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,960
again they need this or that and you try

675
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:07,200
to add something to the system

676
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:10,000
and it just it throws it further

677
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,440
to the left and not where it needs to be

678
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,480
you know what i mean

679
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,519
yep absolutely let's move on to

680
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,759
ph up and ph down so i get so many

681
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,599
comments in my comment section

682
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:22,960
with a lot of people really scared to

683
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,719
adjust the ph

684
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,200
you know um you know ph down for example

685
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,400
a common thing that's used for that is

686
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,159
phosphoric acid

687
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,080
ph up for example a common thing that's

688
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,278
used is potassium hydroxide

689
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:39,278
potassium carbonate

690
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:40,640
the common thing that said is if we're

691
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:41,440
using these things we're killing off the

692
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,520
microbes

693
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,600
in the medium or you know are we

694
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,319
eradicating the microbes in the medium

695
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,599
from

696
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:52,158
a few drops or a few milliliters of

697
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,959
you know potassium hydroxide potassium

698
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,760
carbonate

699
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,480
phosphoric acid you know if so what what

700
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,278
if so

701
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,440
do we know what the impact is on that

702
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:01,440
well

703
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,519
the again because one of those three

704
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,038
things i said earlier was ph large ph

705
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:12,798
fluctuations

706
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,319
are going to definitely affect the

707
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:17,359
biology in the soil

708
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:20,480
or what species can you know

709
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:23,678
exist but if you're like

710
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,200
you know if your soil is at like 6.3

711
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,120
and you're like oh i want to get it up

712
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,919
to 6.8

713
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,278
and you use you know first of all you're

714
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,480
not going to be able to do that

715
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:39,440
by ph your water right so

716
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:43,038
ph for water is usually

717
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,880
done for hydroponics typically

718
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,879
with organic growers they are already

719
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,360
starting off with a good source of water

720
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,880
that's not high in sodium or

721
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:53,599
bicarbonates

722
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,278
and if you're where you shouldn't i mean

723
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,398
if you're running hydro

724
00:27:55,278 --> 00:28:00,319
there's some cases where

725
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,798
biology might be important like maybe if

726
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,158
you're doing a cocoa system

727
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:07,519
where those are going to be a little

728
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:10,559
more conducive to biology

729
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:13,200
but you're not looking for

730
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,119
you're not looking for like biodiversity

731
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,000
in these types of hydro systems right

732
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,079
because if

733
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,200
if that was the case then why are you

734
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,960
even using

735
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:26,960
synthetics in the first place microbiol

736
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:30,558
uh microbes don't work as well

737
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,919
in synthetic systems as they do in

738
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,398
organic living systems so that being

739
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,159
said

740
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:40,398
if you're you know running like

741
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,000
cocoa or hydroponic system where you're

742
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:43,759
having to adjust ph

743
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,319
and you're worried about biology you're

744
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,599
probably looking you need to be looking

745
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:50,798
at

746
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:54,079
specific types of microorganisms that

747
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:55,440
can help that's that particular system

748
00:28:54,079 --> 00:29:00,480
out that aren't going to be

749
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:04,798
affected by those types of swings

750
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:07,679
as far as ph in soil

751
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,319
typically if you're using a good clean

752
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,038
source of

753
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:12,480
water that's low in bicarbonate and

754
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:15,599
sodium and chlorine

755
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,519
chloride sorry chloride

756
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:20,079
you shouldn't have to really worry too

757
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,480
much about your ph

758
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,599
as long as the soil ph is where it needs

759
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,720
to be

760
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:30,000
because the soil will buffer

761
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:33,519
the ph of the water as

762
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,038
long as the water is clean

763
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,119
if you have a bunch of bicarbonate in

764
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:39,278
there and you keep adding that in

765
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,558
adding that in adding that in it's going

766
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,960
to slowly raise that ph

767
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,398
up not only that but it's going to

768
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,600
antagonize

769
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:48,398
your catio cation balance and the

770
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:51,439
ability

771
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:55,359
for calcium magnesium

772
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:58,960
and potassium as well as even your

773
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:00,558
other cations from your micronutrients

774
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,399
which is going to be copper zinc

775
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:09,278
iron manganese the only

776
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:10,798
one that's not a cation i think is boron

777
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,480
and you know some of the other ones that

778
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:13,119
i didn't mention but out of those ones

779
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,480
out of the

780
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,959
the five major ones major micronutrients

781
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,079
that are

782
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,759
that are responsible for a lot of the

783
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:25,599
enzymatic processes folding of proteins

784
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:28,319
and rna

785
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,599
in the biomechanics i think the concern

786
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:31,119
for some of the folks that

787
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:32,879
are growing in soil is that they're

788
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:36,398
starting with a water

789
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,480
source that's like a 7.5 or an 8.0 ph

790
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,158
and they're worried that that would have

791
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,159
an impact and so

792
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,240
adding in that few drops you know two

793
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,360
three drops of phosphoric acid to get

794
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,759
that

795
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:48,879
you know ph down you know they worry

796
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,119
about about that

797
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,080
so that's why i bring up that question

798
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,678
okay um

799
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:55,359
and then just kind of touching on

800
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,519
organic ph adjusters

801
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:58,959
versus synthetic so we talked about like

802
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,919
phosphoric acid for

803
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,360
ph down and then potassium hydroxide and

804
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,799
potassium carbonate for

805
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:08,158
ph up some people

806
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,839
okay since you're mentioning those

807
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,559
particular chemicals right

808
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:14,158
phosphoric acid and uh potassium

809
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:17,440
hydroxide

810
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,000
okay so a lot of people who probably are

811
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,720
using

812
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,960
organic or who think they're growing

813
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,798
organically

814
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:29,600
there is a lot a lot of these

815
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:30,558
so those aren't organic chemicals but

816
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:32,959
they are

817
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,720
used consistently across the board a

818
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,120
number of products anything from like

819
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,278
nectar of the gods

820
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:40,798
those types of products where they're a

821
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:42,640
liquid nutrient

822
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,000
what typically they'll do they'll take

823
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,880
something like bone meal

824
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,440
and they'll they'll dissolve it in the

825
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,600
phosphoric acid

826
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,880
and so they're using an inorganic

827
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:57,278
process

828
00:31:52,880 --> 00:32:01,360
for to to release organic

829
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:04,558
substances that'll stay in a solution

830
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:06,079
same with uh potassium products you know

831
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:08,398
there are potassium products that are

832
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:10,798
labeled as organics but they've been

833
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:12,319
so that's one one of the things though

834
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:15,679
those types of things

835
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:17,759
in small amounts don't don't

836
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,440
hinder biology it's those it's those

837
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:22,879
huge swings

838
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:26,080
and then also if

839
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,840
if your home grower and your ph is high

840
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:30,480
go and test your water and see why it's

841
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:33,278
high because typically that means

842
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,919
you you have bicarb bicarbonate and

843
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:37,038
sodium

844
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,919
in your water okay so and if that's the

845
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,879
case you sh

846
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,000
you should be using a filter or using

847
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,360
distilled water

848
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,960
or you know you should be what happens

849
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:49,359
in the systems is

850
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,240
things can go fine for a really long

851
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:53,278
time

852
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,839
but you compile problems slowly

853
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:57,679
it's why i tell people you shouldn't be

854
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:58,720
feet you know i know a lot of organic

855
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,720
growers um

856
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,679
i was one of them that used kelp meal

857
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,919
constantly and ocean inputs

858
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,880
and it's like after you compile all of

859
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,519
these things over

860
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,080
run after run run after run dude your

861
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,038
sodium

862
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:14,480
and your chloride are [ __ ]

863
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:17,119
skyrocketed

864
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,480
it comes from the ocean let's think

865
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,599
about this for a second

866
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,079
you know like the ocean is full of

867
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,839
[ __ ]

868
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:25,839
salt so

869
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,679
not only that but you have to remember

870
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:30,480
too heavy metals can compile the same

871
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,679
way

872
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,360
so even if something has a small amount

873
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,240
of heavy metals but you use it

874
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:38,558
consistently

875
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,240
consistently and consistently it'll

876
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,839
build up over time

877
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,079
so when some growers are saying you

878
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:47,119
should be using baking soda for a ph

879
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,720
up versus you know potassium hydroxide

880
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:51,678
or potassium carbonate

881
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,159
or using lemon juice or vinegar for ph

882
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,120
down

883
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,360
instead of phosphoric acid you know

884
00:33:55,119 --> 00:34:00,558
would you agree with that would you

885
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:04,479
i dude it's not it's

886
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:06,720
the amount that you're applying for that

887
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,679
like okay so let's say i got a 50 gallon

888
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,878
reservoir right

889
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:14,000
and it i need to take it down by

890
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:17,039
0.8 the amount of whatever i

891
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,199
am adding in there is

892
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,440
just not going to be enough to really

893
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:24,638
like mess that up it's it's when you

894
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,838
have these wide fluctuations

895
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,159
you know when you have way over

896
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:31,039
watering and then way too much dry back

897
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,559
and what you know

898
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:37,440
it's consistency is kind of key

899
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:39,199
that's why the the you know the blue mat

900
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,398
systems work so well if you have

901
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,598
something that's

902
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:44,960
consistent all the time you know what to

903
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,720
expect

904
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,240
i love blue mats i actually just started

905
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,638
using them and uh

906
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,678
they're awesome so good um so one thing

907
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,119
i learned in

908
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,960
i think you touched upon it is that

909
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,358
different microbes are going to function

910
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,960
best to kind of different ph values you

911
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:02,078
know is this true

912
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,639
and then kind of what is that ideal ph

913
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,599
range you know for soil and i guess for

914
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,159
hydro that

915
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,599
people should kind of stick with so

916
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,879
here's the thing right

917
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:15,920
the the soil ph range

918
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,519
that okay it's such a weird it's such a

919
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,358
weird thing to address

920
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:21,358
because there's an optical there's an

921
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:24,159
optimal range

922
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:25,920
for you know uh soilless media and then

923
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:31,118
there's an optimal range

924
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:33,599
for uh for you know medicinal plants

925
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,240
but the ranges for ph for different

926
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,680
types of

927
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:40,879
bacteria different microorganisms is

928
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:44,000
all over the place depending on species

929
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,838
right it's like typically

930
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,039
all plants on earth will

931
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:54,000
are between five five and like

932
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:55,358
eight at the highest usually i mean

933
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,599
depending on

934
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:59,119
you know the type of soil that they're

935
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,160
in but blueberries are

936
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,559
something that is acidic

937
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:05,279
they like acidic soils and there's other

938
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:09,119
plants that like

939
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:13,359
little more calcareous soils so

940
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:16,640
or higher ph soils um i mean

941
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:19,598
that's you can say that about plants you

942
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:21,759
can't say that about microorganisms

943
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,119
because there are microorganisms that

944
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,960
prefer

945
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,880
to have an incredibly low ph

946
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,960
range well there's some that have will

947
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,599
only function in a in a high ph range

948
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,679
there are

949
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,200
some microorganisms that will not

950
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:36,239
function at all in the presence of

951
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:38,000
oxygen

952
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:40,239
there's some that are foculative they

953
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,239
can function in high or low and there's

954
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,559
some that only function in high oxygen

955
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:46,879
environments

956
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:50,480
microorganisms are so abundant

957
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:54,240
and they have so many different ranges

958
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:58,240
but what i'm looking at for the types of

959
00:36:54,239 --> 00:37:01,358
microbes that i use it depends on

960
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:01,358
what i'm trying to do with it

961
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,598
this product right here from my company

962
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,119
bokashi earthworks

963
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:12,240
which is a consortium of

964
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,119
several different bacillus species uh

965
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,879
non-purple surf sulfur bacteria right up

966
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,480
pseudomonas pollustrius

967
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,480
and also a photo and also yeast which is

968
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,679
saccharomyces cerevisiae

969
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,920
also known as brewers yeast very that

970
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,919
yeast is very common it's found in soils

971
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,519
it's found on fruit

972
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:37,358
if for this particular product if the ph

973
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:40,719
doesn't go below 4.5

974
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:44,078
it won't stabilize you know so

975
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:47,199
for this specific consortium

976
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:51,440
although they can operate

977
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:55,199
in a wide ph range from like 3.5

978
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,679
all the way to like 8.5

979
00:37:55,199 --> 00:38:00,399
if i want them to do a certain thing and

980
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:02,879
stay have viable spore

981
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,559
it has to be at a certain ph right so

982
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,079
where they're suspended in solution

983
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:06,639
they're all alive and they're waiting

984
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,280
for

985
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:10,078
the opportune environment to where they

986
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,960
start

987
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,000
procreating microorganisms very strange

988
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,880
like this

989
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:22,320
small things can can change

990
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,160
what's going on we also know that there

991
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,320
are certain microorganisms that we can't

992
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:28,239
even

993
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,359
you know we can't culture in laboratory

994
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:34,959
settings they only exist

995
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:38,000
in in nature and they can't be grown

996
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,920
and cultured because

997
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,119
their nutrient requirements think about

998
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,680
it like this

999
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,240
if you had a medicinal plant that had

1000
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:49,838
this

1001
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:52,719
really crazy wild nutritional need

1002
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:54,239
and it was not typical to what you

1003
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:57,039
usually want

1004
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:58,799
and it's just all over the place and you

1005
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:01,039
would have to figure out exactly what

1006
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,280
this is and it was only this one

1007
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:05,199
special mix that you would never find

1008
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,920
anywhere else for any other plant in the

1009
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:07,598
world

1010
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,760
is the only thing that would make this

1011
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,800
thing grow it's how it is for some of

1012
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,119
these biology

1013
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,000
for some of these microorganisms in

1014
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,358
these biological

1015
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,920
systems some of them will only exist

1016
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:22,639
well a certain specie of plant is

1017
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,159
present and it's giving

1018
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:26,159
and that plant is releasing a

1019
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:27,519
photosynthetic and exudate into the soil

1020
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,759
that's going to sustain

1021
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:31,358
the nutritional needs of that specific

1022
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,839
microorganism

1023
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:34,799
gotcha good information there for sure

1024
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:37,838
so let's talk about

1025
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,079
um kind of the soil temperature in

1026
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:41,039
in a sense so one thing i've learned is

1027
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,039
that

1028
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:46,239
the lower the soil temperature in the

1029
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:48,239
medium the slower microbes move

1030
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:50,479
that being said what is the ideal soil

1031
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:54,078
temperature for microbial activity

1032
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:57,358
you'd be surprised 84 to 98 degrees

1033
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,480
wow for most species you know what's

1034
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:02,000
really interesting

1035
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,719
when you increase your

1036
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,480
vpd and you're running high temps high

1037
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:11,519
humidity

1038
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:13,199
in soil systems you get way better

1039
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:15,199
nutrient cycling capacity your

1040
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,118
phosphorus is gonna is gonna cycle

1041
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:19,199
better

1042
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,720
so will some other things this is what

1043
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:23,759
i've seen from

1044
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,000
data that i've collected right and it's

1045
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,119
like

1046
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,960
this this is why when you

1047
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:33,838
think at least when i think of

1048
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,920
how to culture a microorganism you know

1049
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:39,838
you have certain environmental factors

1050
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:42,800
microbial incubators are typically used

1051
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:44,880
to culture different types of spore and

1052
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,720
those ranges are usually between 84 and

1053
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,160
98 degrees depending on the species and

1054
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:50,000
the bacteria or

1055
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,598
fungi whatever it is that you're

1056
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,039
culturing

1057
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,559
now they there are different species

1058
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:58,239
that do better at

1059
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:01,519
higher lower temperatures like we talked

1060
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:03,759
about earlier higher lower humidity

1061
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:05,119
but what i've seen in soil is that when

1062
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,040
you have higher temperature higher

1063
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,640
humidity

1064
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:16,079
this the everything works better

1065
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:18,239
as far as nutrient cycling capacity

1066
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,160
when it when you're seeing how things

1067
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:23,439
fall into solution

1068
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,399
especially for phosphorus um so yeah

1069
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,400
soil temperature

1070
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,800
we got cut off for a second but um so

1071
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,480
you know i'm looking at things from you

1072
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,280
know how do you

1073
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,559
how do you grow microbes and usually

1074
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,400
you're looking at higher humidities

1075
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:40,400
higher temperatures

1076
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,000
and when you and the same thing applies

1077
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,559
in these systems when you have the

1078
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,800
higher

1079
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:47,039
humidity and higher temperature you're

1080
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,800
able to retain more moisture

1081
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,119
as long as you have a really like for

1082
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,039
these modified soil mixes that most of

1083
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,318
us organic growers are using they're

1084
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:57,119
highly porous

1085
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:59,759
so that maximizes the gas exchange

1086
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:02,240
capacity of that soil

1087
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,960
which means there's a lot of oxygen

1088
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:05,759
there's

1089
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,440
it's able to retain the moisture while

1090
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,240
still having a lot of oxygen and have

1091
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,960
those higher temps it allows for

1092
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:13,439
these populations of microbes to really

1093
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,000
you know

1094
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,440
really cycle it just increases their

1095
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,480
activity

1096
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,838
um you can kind of see this too

1097
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,760
if you go and say you mixed up some

1098
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:28,880
fresh compost and some

1099
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,640
amendments maybe some like alfalfa stuff

1100
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,000
like that and when you put it into your

1101
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:35,199
tote

1102
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,679
you know to cook you get the mycelium

1103
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:40,318
you get all the bacterial and fungal

1104
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,838
growth all the mycelium mats

1105
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:43,599
you know when you're and it's because

1106
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:46,078
you have those those nice

1107
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,838
warm conditions when everything starts

1108
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,920
to

1109
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:51,599
cycle right when there's a lot of food

1110
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,358
for them to sequester and there's a lot

1111
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,119
of things to be broken down there's

1112
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:57,759
plenty of carbon

1113
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,480
plenty of nutrient that those

1114
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,960
environments usually warm up

1115
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,880
and it's because of all the activity

1116
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,960
they can get too hot

1117
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,920
obviously we've seen that with

1118
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,599
thermophilic

1119
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,159
compost where it heat you know gets too

1120
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:18,000
hot i've actually seen compost uh

1121
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:20,000
light on fire before um

1122
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,599
but yeah those those temperature ranges

1123
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,440
seem to do better with the higher

1124
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,838
humidity and higher temperature ranges

1125
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,119
obviously when we're growing a medicinal

1126
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:30,799
plant we

1127
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:34,640
don't usually want to exceed a leaf

1128
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:39,359
a temperature of 84 degrees

1129
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:42,078
unless you're able to you know really

1130
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:43,679
maximize that environmental condition

1131
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,480
where your nutrients

1132
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:47,838
are all on you know they're sufficient

1133
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,519
and balanced and then you also have

1134
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:52,639
supplemental co2

1135
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:54,880
your vpd is in range um

1136
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:55,838
if if it's not if you go higher than

1137
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,680
those temperatures

1138
00:43:55,838 --> 00:44:03,119
it has a hard time with some of the uh

1139
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:05,679
the enzyme mechanics of of

1140
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,358
photosynthesis or not photosynthesis but

1141
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:11,279
with the creation of a

1142
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:14,400
chlorophyll and you really have to

1143
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:17,599
have everything dialed in if you want to

1144
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,880
you know maximize that but

1145
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:24,318
ideal range man if you can run your vpd

1146
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,640
a little bit higher without going over

1147
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:28,400
and kind of keep your humidity up but

1148
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:29,279
consistent because one of the things

1149
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,838
that

1150
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,800
you know will cause bacteria to grow bud

1151
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:37,358
mold particularly is if you have

1152
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,960
huge fluctuations again it's that those

1153
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:41,440
fluctuations from where

1154
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,400
you're consistent vape vpd and it either

1155
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,200
drops

1156
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,680
or it goes too high consistency is kind

1157
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:48,239
of

1158
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:50,078
key is what i've seen as long as you

1159
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:53,598
have consistency across

1160
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:56,640
the board things seem to function

1161
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,720
pretty well gotcha yeah because

1162
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:00,799
you know soil temp isn't something

1163
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:03,679
really that a lot of people talk about

1164
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,079
you know since the soil temp has such an

1165
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:06,239
impact

1166
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,000
on microbial activity should we be

1167
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:10,399
monitoring it more closely like

1168
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,119
would you consider the soil temp just as

1169
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,599
important

1170
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,599
or even more important than the canopy

1171
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,200
or leaf surface temperature

1172
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,480
it's a really good question and it's not

1173
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:20,719
something that i've really done a lot of

1174
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,960
science on i haven't really delved

1175
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:24,480
into what's happening at different

1176
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,800
temperatures

1177
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,719
you know i haven't even really taken

1178
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,640
soil temperatures to be honest so it's

1179
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:33,358
something that

1180
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:35,199
it peaks my interest definitely and it's

1181
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:37,358
another data point that could be taken

1182
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:39,118
into consideration what we're looking at

1183
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:40,799
things like the soil test saturated

1184
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,079
paste test the leaf tissue and the sap

1185
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,480
testing

1186
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,000
you know how is soil temperature

1187
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,159
affecting things

1188
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,358
um i'm usually not looking at soil

1189
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:54,480
temperature i'm usually looking at

1190
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:56,559
rh and temperature and

1191
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,240
you know those are the things that i'm

1192
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:59,759
mostly looking at surface temp on the

1193
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:02,799
leaf if we're

1194
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,560
using leds led is a little bit more

1195
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,920
complicated

1196
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:10,480
in my opinion gotcha okay

1197
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,358
so switching up a little bit so general

1198
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,679
question here

1199
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:14,400
when the soil dries out microbes go

1200
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:16,559
dormant right

1201
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,760
it's kind of like a sleep state for them

1202
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:19,759
do some actually die

1203
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,079
at that point if the soil dries out or

1204
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,520
no or like when you've rehydrated kind

1205
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,720
of they wake back up from that dormant

1206
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:26,480
state

1207
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:28,318
yeah so there are different

1208
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,480
microorganisms that are going to be

1209
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,440
ubiquitous to the environment they're

1210
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,599
all around us

1211
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,519
those types of microorganisms will

1212
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,318
reestablish themselves

1213
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,519
however if there was like a specific

1214
00:46:37,318 --> 00:46:43,440
microorganism in that

1215
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:46,239
system it could potentially be

1216
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,318
uh eliminated unless it has the the the

1217
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:49,759
ability to endospore late like we talked

1218
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:51,519
about earlier so

1219
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,839
some varieties a lot of the bacillus

1220
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:57,119
species they have the ability to

1221
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:59,759
encapsulate their dna into an endospore

1222
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,800
and those endospores they create like a

1223
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,359
wax coating

1224
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:06,160
they're really resilient different type

1225
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:08,078
of biotic and abiotic stress factors

1226
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:10,318
and that's what makes them such a

1227
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:14,960
prevalent species

1228
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:17,519
in soil and so when they do dry out

1229
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,039
um if you have large microbial

1230
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:22,159
populations what will happen

1231
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:24,239
is you have a lot of

1232
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:25,920
tiny tiny little microorganisms that

1233
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:26,879
create these wax coatings and that's

1234
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,200
what causes

1235
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,200
soil to go hydrophobic so if you've ever

1236
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:34,239
seen a really really dry soil you pick

1237
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:37,439
it up throw it on water it floats

1238
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:38,000
it has to completely rehydrate until

1239
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,039
that soil

1240
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,318
will actually sink and it's because and

1241
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:42,960
so it's the same thing same thing could

1242
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:45,838
happen

1243
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,519
that's really what you are going to be

1244
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:49,199
more concerned about because you can

1245
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:51,599
always re-inoculate

1246
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,919
or you know those populations are all

1247
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,960
going to naturally come back

1248
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,079
once you rehydrate that material the

1249
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,039
problem is

1250
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:03,280
it can be really difficult to rehydrate

1251
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:05,440
soil that's gone hydrophobic

1252
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,119
and oftentimes it takes something like a

1253
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,760
surfactant

1254
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,480
so you can get that penetration into dry

1255
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,280
spots

1256
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,559
so that's that is really the main

1257
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,800
concern with

1258
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,599
with you know letting your soil dry out

1259
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,680
but yeah

1260
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,800
it'll come back you know there are

1261
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:23,519
microbes

1262
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,318
in that soil they will continue to be

1263
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:26,079
there

1264
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:27,920
some of them will die out here's an

1265
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,960
example right anything that's going to

1266
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,280
be uh

1267
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,199
like an anaerobic species which is most

1268
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,680
your most your pathogens like your

1269
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:39,519
fungal root pathogens

1270
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:43,440
are going to be optim they're going to

1271
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:43,440
have an optimal operation

1272
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:50,558
in in low to no oxygen conditions

1273
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,359
so if you let your soil dry out and

1274
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,920
there's no more

1275
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:55,920
oxygen in that soil you're going to be

1276
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:59,119
eliminating a lot of that

1277
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,680
that species do you recommend

1278
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,200
folks use a wetting agent every time

1279
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:06,480
they water

1280
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:07,439
no no no no it's not necessary no it's

1281
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,519
not necessary i

1282
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,440
i mean i don't ever use a surfactant in

1283
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:14,800
less

1284
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:17,679
and less it's like uh

1285
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,880
ipm foiler or if your soil's gone

1286
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:20,558
hydrophobic

1287
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,400
okay interesting yeah i've heard

1288
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,920
recommendations to just use it every

1289
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,358
time because it doesn't really cause

1290
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,920
harm it would help

1291
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:29,039
the soil in the long run but so i was

1292
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,559
just curious on that one

1293
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:32,639
well well here's the problem if you were

1294
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:35,440
going to use this i i i don't know if

1295
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:36,719
this you know this is just my thoughts

1296
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,400
on it really

1297
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:40,879
if you're going to use a surfactant like

1298
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:44,079
yucca or something or

1299
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:47,680
every time that you're watering

1300
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:51,200
i would uh assume that at some point

1301
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:52,879
unless you're really letting a i water

1302
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:54,960
every day you know so for me

1303
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,160
if i were to use a surfactant every day

1304
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,519
it would be a kind of

1305
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,078
cost-effective it wouldn't be

1306
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:03,119
cost-effective it'd be waste of money

1307
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,960
but also you know

1308
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,039
what that does is it basically makes

1309
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,159
water wetter

1310
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:11,039
and when we're in a system a living soil

1311
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:13,598
system

1312
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:15,599
where we want to have the maximum amount

1313
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:18,160
of gas exchange

1314
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,599
i don't want to create any anaerobic

1315
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:22,799
conditions in my soil

1316
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:25,280
so over watering or

1317
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,280
you know i would think that if you did

1318
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,119
that constantly over and over every

1319
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:33,200
watering that you could

1320
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:34,880
could potentially create problems

1321
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:37,279
but it's never something i personally

1322
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,240
experienced because

1323
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,400
the only time i use a surfactant is for

1324
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:46,078
coverage for ipm foilers

1325
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:49,760
or again for hydrophobic soils

1326
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:52,480
got it that makes sense um okay

1327
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,200
inoculating the soil so how often should

1328
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,039
growers be

1329
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:56,799
inoculating the soil i mean there's some

1330
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:57,920
growers out there that

1331
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,599
two three times a week they're

1332
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,639
inoculating they're using mammoth p

1333
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,160
they're using

1334
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:04,318
um you know great white then they're

1335
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:05,838
adding some recharge and

1336
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:07,440
you know can you really go overboard

1337
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:08,078
with these is there a general

1338
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,800
recommendation

1339
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,839
for how often you should be using them

1340
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,720
you can definitely go

1341
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:15,039
overboard on your bank because a lot of

1342
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:16,879
those

1343
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:18,480
things a lot of those things are

1344
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,519
expensive man

1345
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:24,639
you know what i mean and great point

1346
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:25,838
look i'm gonna tell i'm gonna i'll tell

1347
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:29,039
you what guys

1348
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:33,679
everybody that's listening there

1349
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:37,358
i i collect data

1350
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:40,639
all the time and

1351
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:43,199
i do a massive amount of research

1352
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,679
there are so many products out there

1353
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:46,879
that are

1354
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:49,358
so overpriced or have such small

1355
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,880
colony forming units that they're going

1356
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:52,960
to be uneffective

1357
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,358
and then you need to be asking yourself

1358
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,199
what's the purpose of this inoculation

1359
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:59,598
if you don't have a clear and concise

1360
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:03,480
understanding of what the purpose of

1361
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:06,318
or what metabolites those specific

1362
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:08,079
microorganisms do then you shouldn't buy

1363
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:10,400
them because

1364
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:11,839
there's so much misinformation dude and

1365
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,800
i see it all the time even by

1366
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:16,159
professionals

1367
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:18,160
and i have a certain style and i'm not

1368
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:19,358
saying that my style is the only way

1369
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:22,719
because there's more than one way to

1370
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:26,078
skin a cat but when it comes to

1371
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:29,919
empirical data that is replicated over

1372
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:32,960
and over and over again

1373
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,680
i'm looking at specific microbes for

1374
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:38,000
specific jobs

1375
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:39,838
i don't use mycorrhizal fungi i don't

1376
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,639
use mycorrhizal fungi for a reason and

1377
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:44,239
that's one of

1378
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:48,480
the huge ones right i will be able to

1379
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:51,919
tell all your audience and my audience

1380
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:55,599
after my next harvest whether or not

1381
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:59,358
there is even an association with

1382
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,880
uh in arbuscular or an endomycorrhizal

1383
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:03,279
fungi

1384
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:06,400
because there's tests for that now so i

1385
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:09,440
can see if there's an endomycorrhizal

1386
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:13,358
that has penetrated into the root itself

1387
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:17,519
what i've seen over and over is that

1388
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:18,880
the cost to inoculate with a lot of

1389
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:21,280
these things

1390
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,960
i don't get any return on it it doesn't

1391
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,480
do anything

1392
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,440
it doesn't do anything if you have a

1393
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:31,199
healthy balanced

1394
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:34,639
soil in fact i've read research

1395
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:38,558
which has shown in different plants

1396
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:42,879
that the symbiotic relationships between

1397
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:46,000
mycorrhizal fungi can become parasitic

1398
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:49,039
when the plant no longer

1399
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,679
requires what the benefit

1400
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:53,920
is that that so let's for instance let's

1401
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:55,759
say your mycorrhizal fungi is releasing

1402
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,880
phosphatase or a

1403
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,000
phosphorus solubilizing enzyme into the

1404
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,039
soil

1405
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,358
and that's its job so this plant

1406
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:09,279
releases a photosynthetic

1407
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:10,400
that is geared for that microorganism to

1408
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,480
keep it around

1409
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,800
in an exchange it'll release the

1410
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:18,240
phosphate that the plant needs

1411
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:21,680
now let's say that that's all good

1412
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:24,799
in some you know agronomic field

1413
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:27,679
setting where you're growing a crop

1414
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:30,000
in field conditions but let's take that

1415
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:31,358
same scenario and we put that in a

1416
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,400
system

1417
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:34,880
where all your nutrition is adequate and

1418
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,760
you have

1419
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,798
adequate phosphate what ends up

1420
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,680
happening

1421
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:43,039
is the plant no longer requires that

1422
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:45,199
symbio that once

1423
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:46,480
symbiotic relationship to cycle that

1424
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:48,159
phosphate into

1425
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,318
that phosphorus in the phosphate the

1426
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:52,960
biologically available form

1427
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:54,318
and so the plant stops releasing that

1428
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,798
photosynthate

1429
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:57,519
now this thing we're talking about we're

1430
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:01,039
talking about

1431
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:03,759
um an organism that has or could have

1432
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:04,719
possibly infiltrated every single aspect

1433
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,520
of this plant's

1434
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:08,159
root system and then that plant stops

1435
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:10,559
releasing

1436
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:12,960
what it needs it has control of its

1437
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,640
whole root system what is it going to do

1438
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,199
it's going to take what it wants because

1439
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:21,199
it can

1440
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:24,960
microorganisms can do amazing things

1441
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:28,078
and matthew gates sink angel

1442
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:32,159
on ig who's a great ipm

1443
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:35,119
specialist we talked about

1444
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:37,759
you know how easily these types of

1445
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:39,760
relationships can switch

1446
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,440
and something that might be mutualistic

1447
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,920
can become parasitic

1448
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,280
very quickly it's something to take into

1449
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,880
consideration

1450
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:51,760
you know we don't have science and

1451
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:54,000
all the data for you know what i

1452
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:58,000
particularly cultivate

1453
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,400
however moving forward as i'm able to

1454
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,880
collect more data and more

1455
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,559
types of tests are become available

1456
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,760
we'll be able to see how

1457
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:10,079
how these work right

1458
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,240
i prefer trichodermis trichoderma

1459
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:14,880
bacillus subtilis combination

1460
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:16,318
and that's because the trichoderma will

1461
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:20,079
will colonize

1462
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:23,519
the root without causing an

1463
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:26,480
without a uh

1464
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:28,559
it's not a it doesn't go into the the

1465
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:31,358
cell itself

1466
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,559
bacillus subtilis will and the

1467
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:36,159
trichoderma will

1468
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:37,040
will facilitate that and they have this

1469
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:39,838
mutualistic

1470
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:41,039
partnership together where they're able

1471
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:43,838
to

1472
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:47,039
eliminate almost all fungal pathogens

1473
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:50,480
and it's because of trichoderma's

1474
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:52,400
high affinity for iron the metabolite

1475
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,440
that it produces

1476
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,280
is the highest iron affinity chelating

1477
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,480
compound in nature and that's the city

1478
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:03,280
of force

1479
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:06,719
what i've seen in organics is that iron

1480
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,920
is very very hard to fall into solution

1481
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:11,598
in a biologically

1482
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:14,639
available form fairies iron fe2 plus

1483
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:17,920
it oxidizes so easily in a ph

1484
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,400
range from 5.5 to 7 that as soon as you

1485
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,079
add

1486
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,798
something like iron sulfate which should

1487
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:26,400
be an immediately available

1488
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:30,318
form it oxidizes into fe3 plus

1489
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:35,200
so having a high iron affinity microbe

1490
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:38,318
that can reduce or i guess oxidize

1491
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:40,159
fe 3 plus intefarious iron and make that

1492
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:42,719
biologically available

1493
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:44,239
you're going to have a greater impact on

1494
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:47,679
that plant's photosynthetic

1495
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:51,199
capabilities so where

1496
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:54,000
when to inoculate and what what to

1497
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:55,358
inoculate is i think more important you

1498
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,039
want to be able to add the right

1499
00:57:55,358 --> 00:57:58,078
microorganism that is going to do the

1500
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:01,599
right thing

1501
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:05,519
i personally i inoculate this

1502
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:08,160
product weekly but i'm also creating a

1503
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:10,798
new product because what i've seen

1504
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:12,159
is that by using that specific product

1505
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:15,599
weekly

1506
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:18,719
that that purple non-sulfur bacteria

1507
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:22,798
it's a photosynthetic bacteria

1508
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:26,318
and it's releasing nitrogen

1509
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:27,519
into the soil so if i have adequate

1510
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:29,759
nitrogen

1511
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:30,559
i want to stop using that at a certain

1512
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,160
point

1513
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,798
so what i'm doing is i'm constructioning

1514
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:38,558
a different consortium

1515
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:42,079
that's more geared for phosphorus

1516
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:44,880
and micronutrient release as opposed to

1517
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:46,160
phosphorus and then getting the added

1518
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,400
benefit of the

1519
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:49,679
photosynthetic bacteria that are adding

1520
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,798
the

1521
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:53,279
nitrogen in really really good stuff

1522
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:55,440
there

1523
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,200
for sure one last thing i want to get

1524
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,039
into before i let you go i know you're

1525
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:00,879
extremely busy person

1526
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:02,880
talk about the rate of reproduction for

1527
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,599
these microorganisms so

1528
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,280
compost teas often used to extract

1529
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,119
microbes from compost

1530
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:12,400
and then there's the brewing process

1531
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:14,720
where there's microbes are reproducing

1532
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,680
what do you know about the rate of micro

1533
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:16,879
reproduction

1534
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:19,118
you know you can either talk about like

1535
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,079
the compost teas versus just adding

1536
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,240
compost

1537
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,280
into the soil and letting them reproduce

1538
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,118
there

1539
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,519
and you have any tips for faster

1540
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:28,798
reproduction besides what you mentioned

1541
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:30,798
earlier

1542
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:32,159
uh it's gonna vary it's really gonna

1543
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:34,719
vary um

1544
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:37,440
you know something that might be really

1545
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:40,719
persistent in soil might not do so well

1546
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:42,880
in water um you know so there's so many

1547
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:44,639
different factors when it comes to

1548
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,318
when it comes to culturing microbes and

1549
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:48,719
it's you know really

1550
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:50,558
only the strongest microbes are going to

1551
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:54,159
be able to

1552
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:56,240
to survive so if you're using a complex

1553
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:58,639
carbohydrate like molasses

1554
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:00,078
you go and do some compost tea i

1555
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:01,598
wouldn't go you know you you have a

1556
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,798
certain temperature range right that we

1557
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,920
talked about

1558
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:09,119
those are ideal for the production

1559
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:11,200
you also want to make sure you know it's

1560
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:12,880
so tricky man it's such a hard question

1561
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:14,960
because like

1562
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,280
like i like my microbes i wouldn't

1563
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,679
oxygenate them to reproduce them i would

1564
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:23,440
solid state ferment them

1565
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:24,879
right there it's it depends on what

1566
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,039
you're trying to go for

1567
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:30,000
and and if you're just doing compost

1568
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:32,159
teas for just a general biology

1569
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,280
i mean you're just guessing anyway so i

1570
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:36,159
mean

1571
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:38,319
brew it don't brew it longer than 36

1572
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:42,000
hours

1573
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:43,920
that's my advice 24 to 36 hours is

1574
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,760
optimal if you're going to do compost or

1575
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:48,720
amendment brews

1576
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:51,119
i personally do not use compost teas i

1577
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:51,838
will use compost teas for bioremediation

1578
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:55,119
for

1579
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:56,400
land you know for agronomic settings but

1580
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,798
that's because

1581
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,440
those things are already so deficient i

1582
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:01,838
can add

1583
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,280
so much into it in any amount and it's

1584
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:05,838
still like

1585
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,720
i could still add more in most cases you

1586
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:09,599
know because we're

1587
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:11,279
building the soil health and fertility

1588
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,000
they work great i think there's a huge

1589
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,359
disconnect

1590
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:18,798
between soil science for

1591
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:20,719
agronomic crops for like earth for like

1592
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:23,119
farming on land

1593
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:23,759
and then using modified growing mixes

1594
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:25,200
because me

1595
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,960
personally i don't use things like

1596
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:29,679
earthworms in my

1597
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,480
or crop covers at scale it doesn't make

1598
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:32,639
sense

1599
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,559
what happens when you add earthworms to

1600
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:36,719
a system that you're monocropping

1601
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:39,040
it turns all that organic matter into

1602
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:40,558
castings which creates compaction in

1603
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:43,519
your soil so you have this

1604
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,720
really really really light soil from

1605
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:48,400
that has great

1606
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:51,598
gas exchange to this really like heavy

1607
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,798
poop warm poop you know

1608
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:54,640
which means you're gonna have to add a

1609
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:56,480
massive amount of aeration you're gonna

1610
01:01:54,639 --> 01:01:57,519
have to add a massive amount of calcium

1611
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,960
amendments

1612
01:01:57,519 --> 01:02:04,000
to break that open and break that apart

1613
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:06,480
so i was totally disconnected

1614
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,079
now that i'm collecting data and i'm

1615
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,880
monocropping

1616
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:13,039
for just my medicinal herbs i i take a

1617
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:15,119
different approach

1618
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:17,280
you know i'm not trying to do all this

1619
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,519
crazy stuff i'm literally just

1620
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,880
maintaining sufficiency and balance in a

1621
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:23,199
system

1622
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,119
when it comes to my when it comes to our

1623
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:28,399
outdoor

1624
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:31,280
and tilling the land and bioremediation

1625
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,400
and using microbes and compost teas and

1626
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,599
composting

1627
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,440
and crop covers all that yeah and it's

1628
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:40,079
the reason is because what we're

1629
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:43,679
starting with is something that

1630
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:44,079
is not very good soil structure is not

1631
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:46,879
good

1632
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:48,160
aeration is not good organic matter is

1633
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:51,680
really low

1634
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:54,239
nutrient density is really low probably

1635
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:56,239
have problems with sodium

1636
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:57,679
you know so these are the things that

1637
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:59,439
we're looking at

1638
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:02,399
and and why it's so important to have

1639
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:05,200
like your soil food web science for

1640
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,200
agronomic crops for like food crops for

1641
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:08,879
like moving towards the future

1642
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:10,558
when i'm talking about something that

1643
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,720
i've already created

1644
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,559
i've mixed the proper aeration i've

1645
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:16,879
mixed the proper nutrient into it

1646
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:18,880
i don't want to do anything else to it

1647
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,280
it's almost like i've taken

1648
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,160
like you know something that would have

1649
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:25,599
maybe taken

1650
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:27,440
50 years of bioremediation to get to

1651
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:29,680
this point that i have in a bed

1652
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,358
or a pot i don't want to change it now i

1653
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:33,759
just want to maintain sufficiency

1654
01:03:31,358 --> 01:03:36,078
imbalance i don't

1655
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,000
you know i will put in the selective

1656
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:39,119
target microorganisms that are going to

1657
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,159
have

1658
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:43,760
pgr responses

1659
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:46,159
or that are going to you know be there

1660
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:49,119
to out compete any types of pathogens

1661
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:51,118
or to cycle nutrients but i'm looking at

1662
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:53,440
target specifics

1663
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,960
in these modified systems now when we go

1664
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,240
out of that realm and we're looking at

1665
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,599
soil systems we're looking at

1666
01:03:56,239 --> 01:04:00,159
biodiversity

1667
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:01,920
we're looking at organic matter crop

1668
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:04,480
cover

1669
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,039
gotcha whole different world whole bunch

1670
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,719
of

1671
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:08,319
good stuff there for sure you can get

1672
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:11,439
really deep on that level

1673
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:13,440
so awesome well um yeah wrapping things

1674
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,039
up how can listeners find you and what

1675
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:18,400
do you have upcoming in the future

1676
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:20,480
yeah so we are

1677
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:23,119
ramping up outdoor production on the

1678
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,079
farm i'm working on some new microbial

1679
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:27,200
products

1680
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:29,440
i'm trying to kind of get

1681
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:30,960
i'm trying to get an uh building for

1682
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,318
bokash i've been doing out of my garage

1683
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,559
forever and i just

1684
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:35,440
i can't do it here anymore there's a lot

1685
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:38,880
going on i am

1686
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:41,760
always in motion i am always doing

1687
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:44,000
something you can find me at

1688
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,680
rust.brandon on ig

1689
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,039
you can find a link to black label

1690
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:52,798
organics my farm bokashi earthworks

1691
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:55,599
my corporation and

1692
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:57,038
i also do private consulting too so yeah

1693
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:58,798
for soil samples right so if somebody

1694
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:59,200
would get a soil sample they can contact

1695
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:01,038
you

1696
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:02,318
and you would kind of consult them on

1697
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:05,440
that avenue

1698
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:09,038
yeah so i work with like very few people

1699
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:11,838
actually um and the reason is because of

1700
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:13,680
my time and also because i'm usually

1701
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:16,880
working with owner operator

1702
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:19,118
farms and

1703
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,358
we're looking we're you know we have a

1704
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,960
specific goal in mind i don't typically

1705
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:23,358
just do like oh hey somebody wants a

1706
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,480

1707
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:29,440

1708
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:31,599
you know i'll help people out man like i

1709
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:33,280
i was talking to a guy on instagram

1710
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:35,599
and he's like dude can you look at the

1711
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:37,920
soil for me he's like i just bought this

1712
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,880
fresh soil company in oklahoma and i was

1713
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,480
like

1714
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:44,480
dude like this is this is terrible

1715
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,760
like this is like they literally took a

1716
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,440
bunch of pete

1717
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,960
and then put some pearlite in it and

1718
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,720
then sold it to you like there's no

1719
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:53,760
nutrition in this

1720
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:56,959
it's it's completely empty so i you know

1721
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:59,599
i dm'd the company and said hey i'm

1722
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,960
you know i'm a private consultant and i

1723
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:01,519
don't know what's going on here either

1724
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,519
maybe you

1725
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:04,960
gave this guy a bad batch of soil or

1726
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:06,559
maybe you guys don't understand target

1727
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:09,039
levels but

1728
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:09,920
he can't grow this he can't grow in this

1729
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,240
and this is a

1730
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:14,318
a small family farm this guy's relying

1731
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:16,318
on this soil

1732
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:18,318
you know for his livelihood and it's

1733
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:20,400
like dude

1734
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:22,000
it's frustrating dude i hate seeing that

1735
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:24,480

1736
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,838
