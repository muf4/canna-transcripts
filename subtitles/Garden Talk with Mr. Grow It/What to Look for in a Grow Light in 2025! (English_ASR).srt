1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,278
we have a lot of folks who are shopping

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,080
for grow lights right here in

3
00:00:04,278 --> 00:00:10,359
2025 what should Growers look for when

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,280
purchasing a grow light well that's the

5
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:16,320
the question is uh is right off the bat

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:18,198
is uh what it's kind of like it's the

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,399
the map you know where are you trying to

8
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:21,840
go is where you're going to try to get

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,879
you know so like let's say you're in a

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,800
tent and uh you're inside your bedroom I

11
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,678
mean right off the bat we've kind of

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,960
nixed HPS out of the the picture you

13
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,359
know not going to be able to grow with

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,679
high-intensity Lighting in a in a small

15
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,200
tent atmosphere it's is you have to air

16
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,039
cool that's one of the things that's

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,840
really uh got me educated on this like

18
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,239
even 10 years ago is you know growing in

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,879
a pre- environment we stacking lights

20
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,519
together in a small room they all had to

21
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,640
be vented hoods so we'd run air through

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,160
the hoods so we'd remove all that heat

23
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,799
and the byproduct of that is you were

24
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,878
cooling the bulb and so color

25
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,599
temperature like you you'd have like an

26
00:00:57,878 --> 00:01:03,320
more orange uh uh number

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,280
uh for the HPS and that's that number is

28
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,200
it's an actual temperature color is

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,439
temperature and so when you're lowering

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,159
the temperature of the bulb to its

31
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,319
actual spec operating thing you're

32
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,880
losing a lot of spectrum and so I

33
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,039
started learning like why is it my

34
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,399
friends that like have like gavitas

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,159
strapped to their ceiling and their

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,880
giant basement are getting what you know

37
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,560
the same gen we'd all share genetics

38
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,078
back then it was it was tougher you know

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,879
there wasn't all the SE a lot of the the

40
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:30,199
the genetic Banks were over in Europe

41
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,640
and stuff and you'd be ordering bur off

42
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,840
the back of magazines like it was sea

43
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,640
monkeys or something you know it wasn't

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,079
wasn't a lot of trust as far as like the

45
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,879
system so it was really relying on the

46
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:41,519
community so we all share genetics we

47
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,519
find things that we we liked we got the

48
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,319
Forum cut of the of the cookies like

49
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,798
back back back in the day when it first

50
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,879
came out and I'm noticing these guys are

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,680
getting way better results than I am and

52
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,920
the only thing that was different is I

53
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,159
was venting them and then turns out as I

54
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,840
started educating myself sure enough I

55
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,759
was losing a lot of spectrum you're

56
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,000
losing a lot of power that's supposed to

57
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,840
be hitting those things so if you're

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,439
choosing I would say uh there's a lot of

59
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,360
controversy controversy right now about

60
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:13,878
HPS versus LED and one of the things

61
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,400
that's very very interesting is genetic

62
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:18,959
expression phenotypic expression I work

63
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,599
with The Jug guys The Jug dealers over

64
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,640
at New Millennium nutrients and uh jiren

65
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,280
always likes to say phenotype is

66
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,479
genotype times environment so you and I

67
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,239
have the same cut we got the same

68
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,919
genetic profile but you put it outside

69
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,480
and I put it in a tent and they're going

70
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,919
to express differently and so I always

71
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:41,639
wondered where did all the things that I

72
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,919
loved in the 2000s where did they go I

73
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:45,639
still I still get the the name some oh

74
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,639
here's the strain you want and they give

75
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:49,919
it to me and it's got the name and it

76
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,799
looks kind of like it but it didn't

77
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,759
taste the same didn't smell the same

78
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,159
didn't didn't quite look the same what

79
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,759
happened was it was it genetic drift you

80
00:02:56,158 --> 00:02:59,639
know was it all the Clones are being

81
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,759
abused or people lying is it not the

82
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:04,000
thing that I did and then as I started

83
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,039
meeting more people more trustworthy

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,598
guys that are ogs in the game I started

85
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:11,039
getting the real stuff I'd get the real

86
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:13,639
cuts from the real people they still

87
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,280
didn't Express why is that and so I

88
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,439
started digging in another hole in

89
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,199
knowledge and I realized oh it's because

90
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:22,680
they're not grown under vented hoods

91
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:26,399
with GH nutrients packed together in a

92
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,840
tiny room VPD out of control like even

93
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,640
bad growing conditions if there's a a a

94
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,560
phenotypic expression that you enjoy the

95
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,079
only way you're going to get it is

96
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,280
through an quote unquote an inferior

97
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,599
growing process because what plants were

98
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,479
selected under is what they will Thrive

99
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:48,318
under especially if you're not running

100
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,840
things like if you get a genetic and you

101
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,438
just take clone from clone from clone it

102
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,000
will acclimate to your environment but

103
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:58,318
it will never it it's code is locked but

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,680
when you uh take something and you breed

105
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,598
it like if you back something and you

106
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,640
self it and you self it against itself

107
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:06,318
and you the genetic remains it shuffles

108
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,318
the deck and I always remember that

109
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,359
family that I grew up with they were I

110
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,759
was friends with the the old the middle

111
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,040
the youngest brother well the oldest

112
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:17,039
brother he was like a genetic copy of

113
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,159
the mom the middle brother was like a

114
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,840
genetic copy of the dad and the youngest

115
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,720
brother was like a direct split and I

116
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,119
started understanding like oh okay there

117
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,919
it when I was dealing with plants I

118
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,918
started getting okay recessive genes I

119
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:31,079
see what's happening it's like some of

120
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:32,918
the grandparents come in some of the mom

121
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:35,839
comes in different eye color different

122
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:38,599
skin tone different hair color it's like

123
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,239
okay I get it and then you take the twin

124
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,240
brothers and you raise them in different

125
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,000
places and they're going to act

126
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,199
completely different twins raised in the

127
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,839
same room finished each other's

128
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,879
sentences yet twins raised across the

129
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:51,519
country can have surprisingly different

130
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:54,759
lives it all started coming together and

131
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:56,680
this comes back to lighting where one of

132
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:59,160
the biggest things that you can do to

133
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,000
change your environment is the lighting

134
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,840
so if you chose an HPS versus LED one of

135
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,399
the things that really makes LED

136
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:10,879
Superior Superior to HPS is that you

137
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,120
don't need the cooling for a a watt is a

138
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,360
watt so if I have a th000 watt LED and I

139
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,519
have a th000 watt HPS technically

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,319
speaking more light there the same exact

141
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:23,719
heat but the LEDs produce more light for

142
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:26,600
that heat so your output is there so

143
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,160
it's not that LEDs are cooler or you

144
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,199
know there's more efficient so a watts

145
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,319
of watt a watt of heat equals x amount

146
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,960
of BTUs and you're going to get what you

147
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,879
get turns out that when you measure

148
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,959
things like Leaf surface temperature

149
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,240
right when you go in there with a little

150
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,719
a little thermometer gun and you point

151
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,120
at at the leaf the you need to run your

152
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,120
room slightly hotter with LED because

153
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,079
there isn't that infrared there's almost

154
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,478
no infrared that when you see those red

155
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,478
diodes in an LED that's them trying to

156
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:57,599
stick some red in there because they

157
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:59,839
don't come with it whereas HPS uh High

158
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,479
Press sodium just kicks out the IR

159
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,279
that's why you could feel the heat

160
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:06,120
coming off it that's why if you go to a

161
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,439
restaurant you you'll see the IR heaters

162
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,160
you'll you'll have something that isn't

163
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,680
glowing it's not red it's not hot you

164
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,280
know to to like visually hot there's no

165
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,680
color coming of it yet you're getting

166
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:18,519
blasted with this this heat that's

167
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,478
coming off of it and that's the just a

168
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:24,399
pure IR lamp that's hitting it you think

169
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:25,879
that uh that wouldn't have a you know

170
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,519
we'll just I'll raise the temperature a

171
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:29,199
little bit but what is kind of

172
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,079
interesting is that's the leaf surface

173
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,560
temperature

174
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,639
it actually affects like the the the

175
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,720
biotic structure of what's going on like

176
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,639
heat stresses and things even though the

177
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,120
there's micro boundary layers that your

178
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,199
plant creates that's why we like a lot

179
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,360
of air flow and get them going and it

180
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,478
breaks those micro boundary layers

181
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,360
across because it it it's just got this

182
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:52,199
micro layer of insulation we'll call it

183
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,000
and so you want to knock that all off

184
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,800
and so just raising the temperature of

185
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,918
your room doesn't necessarily get the

186
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,639
plant leaf surface temperature all that

187
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:03,639
much higher whereas if you're bombarded

188
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,960
with that IR it gets it way higher I was

189
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,478
like oh so even the things that we kind

190
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:10,719
of consider not valuable in growing oh

191
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:13,000
it is affecting the metabolism of the

192
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,360
plant this is why I'm not getting that

193
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,839
that diesel expression I want that 2003

194
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:23,280
diesel you know like uh lifestyle Rob

195
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:24,878
and I when we were hanging out in Vegas

196
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,719
you know we're just the right amount of

197
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,720
Boomer Millennial that uh we remember

198
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,879
that 2003 diesel baby where to go it

199
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,319
still exists you just have to grow it

200
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:39,039
wrong according to 2025 standards got it

201
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,759
yeah I feel like these days particularly

202
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,680
in the Homegrown Market that I feel like

203
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:46,000
a majority of people are going with LED

204
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,360
versus the hid you know hiid that

205
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,720
whether bhps or MH or even CMH falls

206
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,919
into the hid category high intensity

207
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,800
discharge but yeah as far as what to

208
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:57,079
look for when purchasing a grow light I

209
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,879
think first thing right off about is

210
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:01,478
coverage area what area are you trying

211
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,319
to cover if you're looking for a 2T X 4T

212
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:04,758
coverage area well you can filter it

213
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,680
down by there and then you can kind of

214
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,280
get into the granular details of what's

215
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,680
the power output what does the light

216
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,758
spectrum look like and then you can even

217
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,720
look at like the diodes drivers people

218
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,280
get really really deep into what's the

219
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,800
btu the heat output so there is a lot of

220
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:20,598
different things that people can look at

221
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,639
