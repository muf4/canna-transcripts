1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,679
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,919
know me my name is chris

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,839
aka mr growit and i'm back with another

4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:12,798
video got an announcement video for you

5
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:14,638
today

6
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,640
all good things come to an end and today

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,358
i want to announce the end of par tests

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,719
on this channel

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,560
it's definitely been a long journey but

10
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,239
i think it is for the best

11
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,320
in this video i'll explain why i got

12
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,559
into part test to begin with

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,079
why i'm stopping them and also i'm going

14
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,118
to refer you to some other channels that

15
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,038
do part tests

16
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,039
so first off why did i get into part

17
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,719
test to begin with well for me i know

18
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,320
when i'm looking for grow light

19
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,160
one of the things i like to look at is

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,079
par output so how much

21
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,919
par that grow light is emitting and you

22
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,119
can look on grow light listings a lot of

23
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,679
them do include a part

24
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,558
chart which it shows uh kind of the

25
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,479
footprint

26
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,878
overview and then it shows different

27
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,238
ppfd numbers across that footprint

28
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,960
some of the problems that i found with

29
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:57,198
that is that some companies only list

30
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,640
one light distance so when you move that

31
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,000
light to other light distances you're

32
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,960
kind of guessing to what the power

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,719
output is

34
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,239
also i found that some companies inflate

35
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,439
their numbers so

36
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,680
what they're actually showing on that

37
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,759
part chart is inflated it's higher

38
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,960
than what actually the par meter that

39
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,040
i'm using is showing

40
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,798
and i've also found that some grow light

41
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,560
companies only list the middle

42
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,560
dead center number so you don't really

43
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,680
know what that light spread is across

44
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,759
the footprint so

45
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,600
i decided to start doing par test videos

46
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,359
where i mean most of you have seen them

47
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,239
i basically take a par meter

48
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,840
and run it across the grow space and

49
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,879
show you what the different ppfd

50
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,880
measurements are

51
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,078
across that grow space and that provides

52
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,078
value because

53
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,679
those who have that grow light get a

54
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,438
better idea of what the grow

55
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,280
light distance should be at the

56
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,039
different stages of growth for example

57
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,960
so it's honestly been pretty fun doing

58
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,479
that you know i got to get my hands on a

59
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,599
bunch of different grow lights

60
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,000
got to talk with a bunch of different

61
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,879
companies and build relationships there

62
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,640
and over the past year i've done 41 par

63
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,560
tests on this channel alone

64
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,519
actually did one part test on my main

65
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,118
youtube channel so 42 total part tests

66
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,718
which is

67
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,078
kind of crazy looking back at it so

68
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:05,039
that's the reason why i got into them in

69
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,478
the first place

70
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,159
i know that there are people out there

71
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,758
that want to see this information and

72
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,280
this information wasn't out there

73
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,679
so why stop i decided to stop because

74
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,719
it really it's very time consuming to do

75
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,879
these part tests

76
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,439
you know from talking with the brands

77
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:25,359
having them send it over to me

78
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,959
unboxing it filming it editing

79
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,200
and most of the time i actually didn't

80
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,039
get paid anything for it they would

81
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,719
let me keep the grow light and i would

82
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,560
have to you know the only way really to

83
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,479
earn money was to resell the grow light

84
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,318
there was a few times where i did get a

85
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,359
small amount of money for doing the part

86
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,039
tests but

87
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,519
it was very very rare i think i maybe

88
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,199
got paid maybe two or three times out of

89
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,879
those 42 videos

90
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,238
anyways the money isn't something that i

91
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,399
really cared about

92
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,000
what i care about more is my time i

93
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,560
found that doing these part tests

94
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,560
really took up a lot of time and i

95
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,400
didn't put out nearly as many videos on

96
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,719
growing plants as i wanted to

97
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,000
i was prioritizing part tests filming

98
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,919
editing those

99
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,919
and then it would come time to film my

100
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,479
plants and edit videos for my main

101
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,719
channel

102
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,238
and i didn't have that time so now since

103
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,840
i'm not doing them anymore

104
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,000
i will be able to spend more time

105
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,759
filming and editing videos on plants

106
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,318
now there are several people who do part

107
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,919
tests on youtube so

108
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,318
since i don't do them anymore i'm going

109
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,639
to refer you to three people who do do

110
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:24,079
them

111
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,000
the second channel that i want to refer

112
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,959
you to is migrow

113
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,519
shane over at migrow he owns micro

114
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,439
lighting

115
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,799
and he does part tests on his channel

116
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,199
not just for his lights

117
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,439
but he does do them for uh several

118
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,158
lights his entire channel is grow light

119
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,400
information

120
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,840
so he's definitely very knowledgeable he

121
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,760
goes in depth about

122
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,000
the part tests and he gives you an

123
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,399
honest opinion on the part test so

124
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,360
some of you may say oh he's he owns a

125
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,080
lighting company

126
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,159
he's biased towards his own lights watch

127
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,840
his videos and you'll see that that's

128
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,919
really not the case last channel i want

129
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,479
to refer you to that does par test

130
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,919
is dr mj coco he just started doing part

131
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,959
test this year i think he probably has

132
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,438
like let's see two

133
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,000
four seven different part tests on his

134
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:07,199
channel

135
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,840
he talks about all the features in the

136
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,679
video shows you the part test results

137
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,920
and then he also has a grow like

138
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,799
calculator which he can calculate you

139
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,839
enter in the

140
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,400
power draw the cost of light the ppf of

141
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,758
the light

142
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,439
then it's going to output what the

143
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,120
photon efficiency is

144
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,879
what the cost efficiency is and then

145
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,478
what the harvest potential is

146
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,000
so lots of good information that he is

147
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,039
showing to his audience and really

148
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,120
this is going to give you more

149
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,919
information in order to make a smarter

150
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,959
buying decision

151
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,120
there are so many grow lights on the

152
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,439
market today it is so easy to get caught

153
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,918
up

154
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,120
and not know what's good versus bad

155
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,399
there are some companies out there that

156
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,319
are selling lights that are three

157
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,599
four five years old that are nowhere

158
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,040
near as efficient

159
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,560
as the grow lights that came out this

160
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,560
year and last year so if you want to

161
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,399
stay up to date on led grill lights

162
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,079
subscribe to these three guys i will

163
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,279
leave a link to their channels down in

164
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,478
the description section below

165
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,079
so what's going to be on this channel

166
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,359
then well i'm going to continue with the

167
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,959
topic videos

168
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,960
i'm going to do more one-on-one

169
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,239
