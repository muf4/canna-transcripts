1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,809
what's up everybody feed that don't only

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,549
my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,849
you'll watch a my extra channel here I

4
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:11,010
have the plant max jungle g6 LED grow

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:13,259
light this LED grow light was sent to me

6
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:15,419
in order to do this unboxing and part

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,310
test video so in this video I'll do just

8
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:19,379
that I'll unboxing and I'll show you

9
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:22,469
what comes inside the box and then I use

10
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:24,509
my Apple gmq 500 power meter in order to

11
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:28,018
do the part test this meter measures

12
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,630
from 389 nanometers to 692 nanometers

13
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:32,070
plus or minus 5 nanometers and the

14
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:33,539
measurements are in ppfd

15
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,700
so if there's any light being emitted

16
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:37,890
outside of that range it will not show

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,530
on this meter okay first thing out the

18
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,840
box is the grow light it is folded in

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,480
half and nicely packaged to prevent

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,719
damage then there are two boxes inside

21
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:51,509
one is labeled accessories and the

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,689
second one is labeled LED driver inside

23
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:57,210
the box that's labeled LED driver is

24
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:59,579
surprise surprise a driver inside the

25
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,570
box that's labeled accessories is a user

26
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,390
manual controller connector cable an AC

27
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:10,379
power cord and in this bag there are two

28
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:13,079
sling hangers a 120 volt 240 volt power

29
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:15,269
adapter and some screws to mount the

30
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:16,530
driver to the back of the fixture if

31
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:19,109
this is your first time tuning into my

32
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,670
part test videos I do these just to give

33
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:22,769
you a general idea of what the power

34
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,450
output is this test isn't going to be a

35
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:26,099
hundred percent accurate I'm taking

36
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,469
measurements in a grow tent and a

37
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:30,359
reflective walls in the grow tent could

38
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:32,578
increase the part numbers so keep that

39
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:35,250
in mind the coverage area for this LED

40
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:37,500
grow light is 4 feet by 4 feet and I'm

41
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,959
taking measurements in a 4 foot by 4

42
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,819
foot grow tent I'm not gonna go over all

43
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:43,379
of the grow lights features but it will

44
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:45,089
provide a link in the description

45
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:47,188
section below so you can click to learn

46
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,140
more this LED grow light does have a

47
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:51,629
dimmer on it for the part test

48
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,399
I'll have the grow light on 100% when

49
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:56,548
the grow light is on and turned up to

50
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:00,090
100% it pulls 659 Watts from the wall

51
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:02,540
with five point four six amps alright

52
00:02:00,090 --> 00:03:44,770
let's get into the measurements

53
00:02:02,540 --> 00:03:44,770
