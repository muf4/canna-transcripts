1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,600
know me my name is chris aka mr growit

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,679
and you're watching max's channel

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:08,240
vivosun sent me over their brand new led

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,119
grill light

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,638
this is the vs 1000 led grill light and

7
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:13,199
in this video i'm going to unbox the

8
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:15,039
unit

9
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,960
i'm going to test the power output and

10
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,320
i'm also going to do a heat test on it

11
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,000
i'm not going to go over all of the

12
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,439
specs that this grow light has

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,198
but i will leave a link to this grow

14
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,480
light in the description section below

15
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,800
so you can click on that link if you

16
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,880
want to learn more okay first thing out

17
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,278
the box is a power cord

18
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,159
actually got this grow light before it

19
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,000
was released

20
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,919
and some of the things that they include

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,479
in the box uh they didn't include in

22
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,480
mine

23
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,679
what also comes in the box is led growth

24
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,479
room glasses

25
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,679
rope ratchet hangers and lastly is the

26
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,439
fixture

27
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,840
for the par test i'm going to use the

28
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,640
apogee mq-500 par meter

29
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,559
this meter measures from 389 nanometers

30
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,640
to 692 nanometers

31
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,599
and the measurements are in ppfd i do

32
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,359
these part tests

33
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,719
just to give you a general idea of what

34
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,960
the power output is

35
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,640
it's not going to be 100 accurate i take

36
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,920
measurements in grow tents which have

37
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,599
reflective walls

38
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,760
that could increase the numbers so just

39
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,199
keep that in mind many growers use this

40
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,799
information to get an understanding of

41
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,478
what their light distance should be

42
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,479
from the plants and also some growers

43
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,840
find this beneficial to match up the

44
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:16,640
numbers from what they're reporting on

45
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,640
their listing

46
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,960
the amazon listing shows a max coverage

47
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,200
area of four feet by four feet

48
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,039
in a core coverage area of three feet by

49
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,960
three feet but this grow light is really

50
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,680
more suited for a two foot by two foot

51
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,438
grow space

52
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,439
in my opinion so i'm gonna try to keep

53
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,000
my par meter in a two foot by two foot

54
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:33,279
space

55
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,438
i'm going to take measurements at three

56
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,400
different distances 12 inches away

57
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:40,078
16 inches away and 20 inches away i plug

58
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,118
the led grill light into my kilowatt

59
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,679
meter and it shows

60
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:48,719
0.8 amps pulling 94.8 watts

61
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,720
all right let's get into the

62
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840
measurements

63
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:39,319
