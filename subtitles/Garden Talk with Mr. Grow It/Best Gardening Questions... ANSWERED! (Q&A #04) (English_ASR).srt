1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,080
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,240
know me my name is chris

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,519
aka mr growit and you're watching my

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,559
talk channel got a

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,719
guest in today's episode we've got max

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,879
he likes to sit in on my lap every once

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,479
in a while i needed to record this video

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,640
and he just plopped right down

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,640
so you gonna be a part of it bud but i

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,519
am back at it again with another q a

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,278
video

12
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,198
this is the second week in a row that i

13
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,480
am releasing a q a video

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,920
if you like these types of videos make

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,039
sure you hit that thumbs up button

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,719
that's going to be an indicator of

17
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:35,119
whether or not i should record more of

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,399
these

19
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,238
and if you have any questions that you

20
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,120
want me to answer within one of these q

21
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,558
a videos

22
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,079
make sure you list them down in the

23
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,280
comment section below can't guarantee

24
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,520
that i'll read your question off

25
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,679
in an episode but i'll certainly go down

26
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,840
there and cherry pick the best ones that

27
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,359
uh i think will be valuable for more

28
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,960
than just one person

29
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,878
okay let's just get right into the

30
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,878
questions do you empty the runoff or do

31
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,000
you let the plants sit in the runoff so

32
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,238
it depends on if i'm growing

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
with organic inputs or if i'm growing

34
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,399
synthetically with bottled nutrients

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,319
if i'm growing with organic nutrients um

36
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,680
what i'll do is i'll water

37
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,759
and then if there is a little bit of

38
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,000
runoff i'll let it soak up now if i feel

39
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,359
like i've accidentally over watered then

40
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,159
you know maybe i'll get rid of it but i

41
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,200
try to avoid doing that at all costs

42
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,520
the reason why is because there's

43
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,799
beneficial bacteria fungi

44
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:25,280
organic matter in that runoff so

45
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,360
disposing of it is arguably waste now

46
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,879
i'm growing with synthetic nutrients

47
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,799
any runoff that i have i like to do

48
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,359
about 10 to 20 percent runoff

49
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,960
now i've let it sit in there in the past

50
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,359
and let it soaked up

51
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,959
unfortunately a salt build up can occur

52
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,799
and it can ultimately lead to

53
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,118
nutrient lockout plant control

54
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,360
deficiencies saw water in

55
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,438
until it's about 10 to 20 runoff then

56
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,680
you use a shop vac to dispose of it

57
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,639
explain your shirt please so i made sure

58
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,200
to wear the shirt

59
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,640
gram per watt with a big x on it so for

60
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,960
those of you who don't know what gram

61
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,399
per watt is it's basically a measurement

62
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,798
that some growers use

63
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,840
in order to determine for the watts that

64
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,600
they're consuming

65
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,359
what is the yield they're getting so if

66
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,039
you're using 100 watt grow light and

67
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,598
you're getting 100 gram

68
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,200
dry yield that's one gram per watt if

69
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,199
you're going with a 300 watt grow light

70
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,799
and you're getting 300 grams of yield

71
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,719
that's one gram per watt

72
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,080
if you're going with a 300 watt grow

73
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,199
light and you're getting

74
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,000
600 grams of yield that's 2 grams per

75
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,679
watt i've actually

76
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,360
seen this measurement being used by

77
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,640
lighting companies in order to try to

78
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,400
sell their lights

79
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,159
that's the main reason why i am against

80
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,920
this it's well known that light isn't

81
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,199
the only thing that determines yield

82
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,479
there are so many different factors that

83
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,399
go into it right

84
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,238
environment's going to go into it

85
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,800
nutrition genetics

86
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,159
is going to go into it lighting so there

87
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,760
are several different things that is

88
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,919
going to determine yield

89
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,280
for a lighting company to say that if

90
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,878
you purchase this light you're going to

91
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,800
get 2 grams per watt

92
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,318
in my opinion is misleading i mean you

93
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,080
can get a high yielding strain

94
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,518
have a half decent light and get a

95
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,959
higher gram per watt

96
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,879
and saying that it's the light that's

97
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,959
doing it again is just

98
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,560
misleading your consumers in a sense but

99
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,400
it's not just that also the the

100
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,400
calculation is

101
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,080
can be somewhat confusing right what

102
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,599
wattage do you actually use

103
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,120
if you're using 100 watts in the

104
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:12,399
vegetation stage seedling stage

105
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,000
vegetation stage

106
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,239
and you're slowly increasing that

107
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,080
wattage into flowering

108
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,519
well what wattage do you use do you use

109
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,239
the veg wattage you use the flower

110
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,599
wattage

111
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,439
if the argument that you're using the

112
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,719
flower wattage well then you're not

113
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,400
using that same wattage

114
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,479
throughout the entire grow so should you

115
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,239
actually be using that flower wattage

116
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,158
or should you be keeping track of the

117
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,759
weeks that you're using 100 watts the

118
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:34,719
weeks that you're using 200 watts 300

119
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,479
watts etc

120
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,080
and then averaging that out because if

121
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,238
you're using a lower wattage and veg and

122
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,599
then using higher wattage and flower

123
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,360
and then you're just using that higher

124
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,719
wattage as a calculation it could be

125
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,400
shooting yourself in the foot now don't

126
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,400
get me wrong i do believe that this can

127
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,680
be used as a personal benchmark

128
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,280
so you can measure kind of your own

129
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,959
performance if you're using the same

130
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,158
growth setup or if you're just changing

131
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,680
one thing at a time and you want to

132
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,759
measure your own performance

133
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,599
sure you can do that but there's so many

134
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,199
variables that go into yield

135
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:02,479
you know like i had mentioned before so

136
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,798
yeah if i see lighting companies that

137
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,318
are advertising a gram per watt

138
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,080
claiming that their light is going to

139
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,598
give them a certain gram per watt

140
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,439
i personally usually avoid companies

141
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,280
that do that any recommendations on

142
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,519
organic fruits for top dressing

143
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,798
during veg and flower there are so many

144
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,759
different organic amendments that you

145
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,758
can use

146
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,799
i personally use earth dust by the green

147
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,120
sunshine company

148
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,959
but there are several others out there

149
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,680
you've got dr earth you've got down to

150
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,799
earth

151
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,680
mr bees trees there are several organic

152
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,079
blends that can be used throughout the

153
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,360
grow

154
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,959
and most of these organic blends they'll

155
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,400
come with a feeding chart or some sort

156
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,239
of feeding instructions

157
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,918
which tell you how to use them question

158
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,600
of the day i want to grow a bunch of

159
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:44,000
how would i do it well that's a loaded

160
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,800
question if i was trying to maximize

161
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,360
yield

162
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,120
growing indoors i would grow in the

163
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,560
largest room possible i would make sure

164
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,120
i have sufficient lighting

165
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,639
that covers the entire area that i'm

166
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,879
growing in i'd make sure that the plants

167
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,199
are getting the optimal amount of par

168
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,319
optimum one of co2 and i would chase

169
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,680
after vpd

170
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,519
of course make sure that the plant is

171
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,439
healthy throughout the entire grill

172
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,719
proper nutrition is certainly key and

173
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,879
then when growing the plant

174
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,000
i would do training in order to try to

175
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,560
maximize that space

176
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,160
as much as possible so trellis net is

177
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,879
one of the ones that i would probably

178
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,400
use

179
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,399
you know i would top the plants do low

180
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,638
stress training and just make sure

181
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,519
every square inch of that footprint is

182
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,199
completely full

183
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,159
in order to maximize yield and then the

184
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,038
last thing would be i would grow a

185
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,039
cultivars

186
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,759
that are advertised as high yielders

187
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,038
love the shirt what happened to nvcmg

188
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,639
i haven't seen anything from him in

189
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,399
months as so in the previous video that

190
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,000
he commented on i was wearing envy

191
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,439
closet med growers shirt and for those

192
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,199
of you who follow him on youtube know

193
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,560
that he hasn't really posted much lately

194
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,400
he actually used to live in las vegas

195
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,000
and we've hung out on a few occasions

196
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,560
but yeah unfortunately he actually moved

197
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,478
away so he's in colorado now i believe

198
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,079
his content on youtube was extremely

199
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,758
valuable to me

200
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,839
personally i've just learned so much

201
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,160
from him over the years

202
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,198
and his brain is like a sponge he learns

203
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,240
so much he knows

204
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,439
so much and uh yeah definitely miss him

205
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
and i definitely hope he comes back to

206
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,079
youtube soon

207
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,519
what ppm of feed you use for the

208
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,959
different stages of growth

209
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,680
this is something i've actually listed

210
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,038
in my book under the ppm section in the

211
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,199
book for those of you don't know i have

212
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,918
a book specifically for beginners

213
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,080
growing indoors and soil or coca-cola

214
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,758
there is a section on ppm

215
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,519
which has a chart i'll put it on the

216
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,720
screen right now so you can see what i'm

217
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,038
looking at

218
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,720
but after sprout vegetation or seedling

219
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,839
stages for the first week

220
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,039
100 to 250 ppm is what i target

221
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:35,359
vegetation weeks 2 to 3. 300 to 400 ppm

222
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:38,560
is what i target veg weeks form beyond

223
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,759
450 to 700 ppm now depending if it's

224
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,079
larger plants

225
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,879
it can go higher than that flowers weeks

226
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,639
one through four

227
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:48,639
750 to 950 flowers weeks five plus

228
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,079
1000 to sixteen hundred something is

229
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,439
going to be able to take more than that

230
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,279
and some phenos are gonna be

231
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,199
sensitive to that and not take as much

232
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,079
as that this is just kind of a general

233
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,840
range

234
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,839
uh that i go by certainly you can

235
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,679
deviate from this and by the way this is

236
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,359
taking measurements on a 500 scale

237
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,598
tds tester and then you can see two

238
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,280
weeks before harvest less than 100 this

239
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,719
is if you believe in flushing there's a

240
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,399
lot of controversy

241
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,240
behind flushing a lot of new studies

242
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,318
have come out on it

243
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,280
general range you know you don't have to

244
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,120
flush but

245
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,559
if you're gonna flush you know aim for

246
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,399
around 100 ppm

247
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,038
it's just general guidance at that point

248
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,519
you should see some fade on the leaves

249
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,240
and uh yeah get those fall colors bring

250
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,639
those out

251
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,079
can you use recharge and liquid cool

252
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,079
bloom at the same time

253
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,240
yeah absolutely so liquid cool boom is

254
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,159
an additive so you'll use your your base

255
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,199
nutrients and then this is an additive

256
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,280
on top of it

257
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,639
recharges a microbial inoculant so it

258
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,839
has beneficial

259
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,680
microbes and also it actually has kelp

260
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,439
and molasses in there as well

261
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,598
but yeah you can absolutely use both of

262
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,120
them how many times can you reuse soil

263
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,360
oh if you're growing organically you can

264
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,720
reuse soil infinite number of times if

265
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,240
you're not aware of how to do that

266
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,400
there are plenty of resources on the

267
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,680
internet on reusing soil

268
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,239
now if you're using synthetic bottled

269
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,240
nutrients generally it's

270
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,918
recommended to not reuse your soil the

271
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,918
reason why is because salt can build up

272
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,079
unfortunately that can lead to lockout

273
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,878
issues you have an imbalance

274
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,478
of nutrients that can happen and uh yeah

275
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,800
you can definitely get poor results

276
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,318
so i know a lot of my friends that use

277
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,319
bottled nutrients they'll just throw

278
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,000
away their soil and

279
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,680
you know when i was using bottled

280
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,959
nutrients i was throwing on my soil

281
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,840
pretty wasteful

282
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,239
but um but yeah that's another positive

283
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,719
of

284
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,439
going organic is you can reuse your soil

285
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,120
absolutely

286
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,639
what are the best tips to get really

287
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,479
rock hard buds

288
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,399
is it as much in the cure as it is

289
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,399
growing is it just genetics

290
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,839
a combination of all maybe yeah so i

291
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,559
definitely think it is a combination of

292
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,360
all so

293
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,719
i'm starting with genetics right maybe

294
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,680
look at people who are growing those

295
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,278
genetics online

296
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,799
taking pictures of it does it look like

297
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,720
a dense blood structure there are

298
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:53,519
definitely genetics out there that don't

299
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,600
dense up

300
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,879
that are kind of naturally i don't want

301
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,040
to say airy but

302
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,639
definitely not a super dense nut bud

303
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,199
structure and then there are also plants

304
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,879
that foxtail it's just in their genetics

305
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,480
so definitely start with genetics and

306
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,399
then environment is going to be a huge

307
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,000
factor in his as well so

308
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,440
you know under the proper humidity

309
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,958
levels you know for example if you're

310
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,640
chasing after vpd if you're trying to

311
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,679
aim to achieve

312
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,639
vpd through all levels of growth

313
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:20,838
you're going to get a better bud

314
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,000
structure than if you were living in dry

315
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,760
conditions

316
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,039
i live in the desert region it's very

317
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,080
dry conditions

318
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,439
i've grown plants in very dry conditions

319
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,278
you know 25

320
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,000
rh 30 rh i definitely think that has

321
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:35,759
impacted

322
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,679
the blood structure so making sure your

323
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,679
environment is dialed in

324
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,039
proper nutrition that's another thing so

325
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,599
it's definitely a combination

326
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,879
of things in order to get that uh that

327
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,399
rock hard bud structure

328
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,320
can i ask you a question i'm a first

329
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,320
time grower and have three sprouts of

330
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,320
ultra auto power seedlings

331
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,080
they came out fast by day two they had

332
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,680
popped and stretched a bit but by day

333
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,759
five they seemed to have stalled

334
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,120
i just tested my soil ph and it's high

335
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,600
at 7.5

336
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,440
will that slow them down and if so how

337
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,240
can i fix it so first off the first week

338
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,000
that that plant

339
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,959
sprouts from the medium that seedling

340
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,519
stage growth is going to appear very

341
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,719
slow

342
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,560
so it might just be that plant

343
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,320
establishing its root structure you may

344
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,479
not see rapid growth start to happen

345
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,399
until weeks you know two three and

346
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,959
beyond when it has more leaves it's able

347
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,720
to intake

348
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:25,199
more energy now you mentioned your soil

349
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,120
ph is high at 7.5

350
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,800
that could potentially be locking some

351
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,720
nutrients out so the next time around

352
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,240
you may just want to water in

353
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,120
at a lower ph maybe at like 6.2 to 6.5

354
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,720
ph

355
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,919
and it should naturally kind of drop

356
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,839
down but that's definitely a good

357
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,278
question i'm glad you asked it because

358
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,040
there have been multiple people have hit

359
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,480
me up in the past and they're very

360
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:45,278
concerned about that first week because

361
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,278
they don't see

362
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,720
much difference in growth but just give

363
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,278
it time be patient

364
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,079
it'll grow can you explain plant stretch

365
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:53,679
in detail

366
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,439
yeah sure i'm not sure if you're talking

367
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:56,799
about plant stretch while the plant is

368
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,760
deceiving or if you're talking about

369
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,039
plant stretch

370
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,120
during the first several weeks of

371
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,559
flowering i'll talk about both so when a

372
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,519
plant first pops its head from the

373
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,919
medium

374
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,600
you could see it stretch the most common

375
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,278
reason why that happens is because the

376
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,399
light is too far away it's it's

377
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,078
stretching up

378
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,000
reaching for that light now it could

379
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:17,199
very well also be the spectrum of

380
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,200
light so if it's high in red spectrum

381
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,600
it doesn't have a lot of blue in it you

382
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,200
will see longer inner node spacing so

383
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,120
that might be a contributing factor

384
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,720
now talking about plant stretch when we

385
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,000
get into the flowering stage

386
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,160
you know once you change that light

387
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,919
cycle over to 12 12

388
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,838
for example the flowering light cycle

389
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,360
the plant will continue to grow upwards

390
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,200
and that's what grows often referred to

391
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,360
as the stretching phase so

392
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,360
depending on the cultivar you're growing

393
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,839
some plants could stretch

394
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,200
three weeks some could stretch two weeks

395
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,279
some phenos are going to stretch more

396
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,920
than others right so some cultivars

397
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,759
you might see a plant stretch barely

398
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,199
other phenols you might see stretch to

399
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:54,559
double its height it was

400
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,240
when you flipped it to flower some

401
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,958
females could be even more than that so

402
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,000
for example

403
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:03,119
i just grew out square one genetics

404
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,039
it was tahoe g cross banana buttercups

405
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,200
and that stretched to three times the

406
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,719
amount after flipping the flour so

407
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,639
genetics is going to be the main thing

408
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,360
that determines how much that plant

409
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,360
stretches

410
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,800
assuming that your environment's dialed

411
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,240
in nutrition's dialed in

412
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,000
so on and so forth that's all the

413
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,360
questions that i have for today if you

414
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,200
have a question that you want me to

415
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,639
