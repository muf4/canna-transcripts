1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,560
i always dry out my soil

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,399
and i'll take it out of the bags i'll

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,080
throw it into like a big like uh

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,519
like tub wear tote you know like one of

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,960
the really big totes

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,719
i'll dump it in there and then i just

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,480
slide it under the exhausting

8
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,559
on the side of my tent so that it's just

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,240
constantly drying out

10
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:22,239
that soil most of the time i only feed

11
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,320
from the start of veg to the end of

12
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,439
flower a lot of times i only feed two or

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,439
three times

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,278
the whole grow i can't remember the last

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,118
time i fed in veg

16
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,119
you top it down too much you gave it too

17
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,640
much food it's too late already you

18
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,199
might as well just start over

19
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,759
you know with a non-stunted plant that

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,000
you haven't

21
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,679
run over with a truck calm down about

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,039
all the small stuff

23
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,878
as long as you stay out of the plant's

24
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:48,079
way it's going to be fine you're going

25
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,079

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,079

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,478
put this onto

32
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,519
platforms that host podcasts so apple

33
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,478
podcast

34
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,478
spotify has podcasts google podcasts i'm

35
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,400
going to put this garden talk series

36
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,560
onto those platforms apparently if

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,320
you're just trying to listen on youtube

38
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,079
on mobile you can't actually just exit

39
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,519
out of the app or else the audio

40
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,118
completely cuts off so

41
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,679
having this garden talk series onto

42
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,438
other platforms will allow people to

43
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,280
tune in and be able to do other things

44
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,399

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,840
it's uh as far as like you know

89
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,479
in youtube there can be a lot of toxic

90
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,920
communities i have not really found that

91
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,079
with this one of course you know you get

92
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,318
the occasional trolls or whatever

93
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,239
but for the most part this community is

94
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,079
it's just fantastic

95
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,840

96

love it absolutely

100

and that's one of the reasons why i

101
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,878
started this show or

102
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,239
podcast is really to you know interview

103
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:15,679
growers from all over the world

104
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,959
and kind of understand how they do

105
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,560
things you know there are so many

106
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,719
different ways to grow this plant

107
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,840
and um you know your style is going to

108
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,719
be different from my style it's going to

109
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,239
be different from

110
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,000
you know the other person's style other

111
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,120
people's styles so um

112
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,120
you know being able to talk with you

113
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,120
today discuss

114
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,519
your growing practices you know other

115
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,280
people's we other people will be able to

116
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,519
listen to this and potentially gain some

117
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,158
ideas on what they can do to implement

118
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,680
into their gardens um so yeah it should

119
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,439
be pretty beneficial for

120
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,239
for a lot of people out there yeah i i

121
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:49,280
would say i have a a pretty different

122
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,000
style than most my main focus whenever

123
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,000
i'm growing

124
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,840
is and especially whenever i'm trying to

125
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,360
tell everybody else how to do it is

126
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,840
is strictly simplicity i try and

127
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,560
and get it down just to the just to the

128
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,080
bare knuckle part of it

129
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,759
because what i was figuring out whenever

130
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,159
i first started the channel is everybody

131
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,359
was

132
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:11,438
so stressed out in the emails

133
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,120
i was getting from them and i'm just

134
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,680
like look you gotta relax

135
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,519
i was like this is a slow process you

136
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,160
can't be in there

137
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,519
all hyped up and angry and stressed out

138
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,759
about this i said you're taking the

139
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,959
completely wrong approach

140
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,680
and that's when i was like all right if

141
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,680
i can just oversimplify this

142
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,199
it you know it'll help a ton of people

143
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,040
out which is one of the main you know

144
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,639
those main reason i wanted to start the

145
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,199
channel was just trying to

146
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,319
you know to share this plant in my

147
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,478
knowledge with it

148
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,240
as much as i could with everybody else

149
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,319
that makes sense makes sense

150
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,840
okay so uh maybe for the viewers who

151
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,879
don't know who you are can you just

152
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,959
you know tell us a little bit about

153
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,959
yourself and how you got into growing

154
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,879
all right yeah uh everybody run a

155
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,918
channel called welcome to the grow tent

156
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,839
and uh once again we do a simplistic

157
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:01,198
approach on growing

158
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:04,560
uh i have really really bad adhd

159
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,600
and anxiety type issues so

160
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,319
i never really liked buying

161
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,960
stuff that i didn't know where it came

162
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,079
from

163
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,478
what was done to it before i got it

164
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,478
uh one of my things with the adhd though

165
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:19,599
is i will run off on tangents so if i

166
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:21,439
start to do that you're gonna have to

167
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,800
you have to bring me back you have to

168
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,120
reel me back in

169
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,478
because uh it's like fireworks going off

170
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,319
in my head almost 24

171
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,159
7. so you'll hear me in the videos i

172
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,879
tell myself to calm down

173
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,759
focus because i just it's like a runaway

174
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,680
train that's

175
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,879
picking 15 different tracks at the same

176
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,918
time

177
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:43,519
so my main thing was with my anxiety is

178
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,198
i genuinely don't really like talking

179
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,918
about it but with my anxiety is

180
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,960
i never really liked just buying stuff

181
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,120
from people

182
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,519
you don't have any idea what they put in

183
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,840
it what they did to it

184
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,959
uh you know i'm not a big person that

185
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,959
that likes taking

186
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,799
medications either like you know dr

187
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:04,079
president prescribed like

188
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,038
xanax or whatever and it just would mess

189
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,079
me up for like

190
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:10,240
11 or 12 hours at a time

191
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,199
and i i felt like my head was up in the

192
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,280
clouds and

193
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,400
somebody else was doing stuff down here

194
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,119
on the ground

195
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,679
and i didn't like it this on the other

196
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,399
hand

197
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,160
i i can grow it i know what's been in it

198
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,719
the whole time because

199
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,560
i'm the one that did it i just liked

200
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,240
that approach to it

201
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,680
and you know i really like all you know

202
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,879
the different strains and everything if

203
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,959
this one's a little bit

204
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,360
you know too head rushy or to something

205
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,279
i can switch to a different strain

206
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,720
and find you know kind of like that

207
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,959
perfect balance

208
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,400
for me that was my that's my favorite

209
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,120
part about that's why i got into growing

210
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,679
it

211
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,879
the control and then because you could

212
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,319
buy something from somebody it doesn't

213
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,120
mean that's what it is

214
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,240
they can tell you whatever you want but

215
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,519
that doesn't mean that's what you're

216
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,680
getting

217
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,198
now i have the control i can do it all

218
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,918
myself

219
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,280
i'm a big control freak basically what

220
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,000
it boiled down to

221
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,198
that makes sense makes sense cool um so

222
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,038
yeah everybody

223
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,439
you know everybody has their own goals

224
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,759
when it comes to growing right

225
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,120
some people go for yield some people go

226
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,919
for efficiency you had mentioned

227
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,759
simplicity

228
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:16,959
was a big thing on your end some people

229
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,720
in beginners and they just want to get

230
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,519
to their first grow and and have healthy

231
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,120
plants

232
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,159
you know besides the simplicity thing

233
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,800
which you already mentioned do you have

234
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,039
any other

235
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,000
goals in mind you do chase after a high

236
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:27,680
yield or

237
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,680
i i really don't because it's not like

238
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,000
i'm selling or anything i'm growing for

239
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,038
me

240
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,279
the yield i've found just comes

241
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,959
with with the more you stay out of the

242
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,279
plant's way

243
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,318
the less i like to say the less you do

244
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,719
the more you get

245
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,080
and the the less you get out of its way

246
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,680
the less you heard it

247
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:50,719
the yield just comes the yield will come

248
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,160
uh i grow more than i could ever hope to

249
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,080
smoke

250
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,840
you know it it says i'm not selling it

251
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,519
and it's just for me

252
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,519
you know every time i pull down the five

253
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,918
by five it's two pounds

254
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,120
and i run perpetual growth so it's

255
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,359
constantly

256
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,560
until i got my trimming machine it was a

257
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,120
nightmare of trimming

258
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,680
all day all night just constant trim

259
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,038
jail

260
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,598
all the freaking time so but it's

261
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,719
it i don't ever chase the yield i find

262
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,199
that

263
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,240
usually by chasing something you get the

264
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,879
opposite

265
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,400
so i like to just you know natural

266
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,599
simplistic ways

267
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,719
that stuff will all come and i i really

268
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,839
don't like how the new people

269
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,440
they're so hard on themselves whenever

270
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,038
they're starting out

271
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,360
you know that another big thing i get

272
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,278
with my emails is they're

273
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,719
like i'm it you know week three of this

274
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,120
or week two of that

275
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,120
my plants don't look anything like you

276
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,879
know what i'm seeing on the internet

277
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,200
here or this guy here

278
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,360
i'm like these guys have been doing this

279
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,839
forever they have so much more

280
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,560
practice than you they know what they're

281
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,640
looking for

282
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,879
they know what their plant needs it's a

283
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,720
repetitive process

284
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,799
don't get so down on yourself you know

285
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,200
people they mess up the first time then

286
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:09,039
they quit and sell all their stuff

287
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:12,240
be patient calm down relax

288
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,799
it'll be all right right yeah i'm in the

289
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,839
same

290
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,439
same boat as you i just grow for myself

291
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,959
i don't sell the dispensaries i'm not a

292
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,440
caregiver or anything like that

293
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,958
um i actually i live in a state where

294
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,160
i'm allowed to gift

295
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,639
in the bill that actually says you're

296
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,000
allowed to gift it and so i actually had

297
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,080
a friend in town yesterday

298
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,360
and he came into town and i had a nice

299
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,519
jar for him

300
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,399
and he was his eyes lit up and he was

301
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,720
super pumped

302
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,839
super pumped so i love to be able to do

303
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,399
that and um

304
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,839
yeah i just gift more and more that

305
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,320
would be awesome i've had a bunch of

306
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,640
people

307
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,480
because just from you know they'll pick

308
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,838
up cues here and there and they figure

309
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,159
out where i'm at

310
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,839
and uh they've had a bunch of people

311
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,079
trying to to get me to do the

312
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,120
the caregiving you know asked me to be

313
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,720
the caregiver

314
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,120
and i was like man if i had if i had

315
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,800
more time i was like but everything's so

316
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
packed and everything in here already i

317
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:03,199
guess

318
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,120
i guess i could start to do it and just

319
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,720
not even grow them plants just give them

320
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,159
you know i got so much excess it's not

321
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,600
even funny so i mean i guess i could but

322
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,799
i just i never have taken on that

323
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,200
responsibility of being a caregiver

324
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,479
for somebody else yet i probably should

325
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,480
but i just haven't because we don't have

326
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,039
that gift thing here i can't just

327
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,920
give people gift people stuff that would

328
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,639
be awesome though

329
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,439
yeah yeah for sure so let's let's uh

330
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,480
let's talk about your

331
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,839
uh uh your current growth setup okay

332
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,839
so can you tell me a little bit about

333
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,560
your setup like you know what size grow

334
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,240
space

335
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,838
lighting some of the equipment you have

336

so on and so forth yeah this is going to

337
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,800

338
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,560
i have a a dedicated room

339
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,479

340
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,159
built just for growing

341
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,759
so everything runs off its own has its

342
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,799
own breaker each tent has its own

343

and then i have a 555

361
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,559
gorilla tint that actually some of my

362
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,839
awesome patreon members

363
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,838
sent to me because they were tired to

364
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,880
hear me complain about my old tent

365
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:42,000
which was a 5x5 it was a 555 and it had

366
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:45,039
one entrance just the front

367
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,519
well i like to scrog plants so only

368
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:47,679
being

369
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,039
i would have to lay down on the ground

370
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,799
and slide

371
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,719
under the the canopy to work on the

372
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,838
plants in the back it was a huge pain in

373
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,759
the butt

374
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,120
well i guess my patreons got so tired of

375
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,600
hearing me complain about this one

376
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,519
entrance

377
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,159
you know five by five is a decent sized

378
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,200
tent that's 25 square feet

379
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:07,600
oh yeah of of canopy

380
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,360
well my tents fill out i fill them out

381
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,079
side to side front to back

382
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,399
the whole thing there's no open space in

383
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:16,399
my tents whenever i'm in flower

384
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,600
so there was no other option except

385
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,559
laying on the ground

386
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,680
like a freaking snake and charming my

387
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,479
way back through the

388
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,000
through the buckets to get to the back

389
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,519
and i just got so sick of it and they're

390
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,879
awesome they sent me a gorilla tent

391
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,799
which now opens the whole

392
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,120
you know the whole thing opens like 180

393
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:35,519
degrees it's like a dream working in

394
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,519
there now

395
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,000
but uh yeah that's pretty much the

396
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,879
extent the two by fours will be coming

397
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,320
down

398
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:46,000
and uh uh light rail uh the company

399
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,040
light rail they just sent me uh their

400
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,120
tents

401
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,838
with their light rail system so i'll be

402
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,240
uh doing those in the future grow series

403
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:58,480
uh as far as lights go i used to be

404
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,000
a huge hugely against led lights

405
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,680
and it really wasn't about the light it

406
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
was mainly about some of the

407
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,599
information that was out there on them

408
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,320
you know people just put them too close

409
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,320
and they're

410
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,760
miniaturizing miniaturizing their plants

411
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,200
and stuff like that but i have been

412
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,519
growing with them lately

413
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,959
they work fantastic they work great i'm

414
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,000
i'm actually pretty in love with them

415
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:20,078
now

416
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,078
um i have a 16 bulb t5

417
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:22,958
from bad boy or quantum whatever it used

418
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:24,559
to be called they're both out of

419
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,719
business now whatever it is

420
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:29,359
and i actually have that in my 5x5

421
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,160
because a 16 bulb t5 is freaking

422
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,560
gigantic

423
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,199
you know it's like a little over four by

424
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,479
four

425
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,920
in area just by itself but i have that

426
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,759
in there

427
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,078
is that for veg only or do you flower

428
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:44,000
like that too flower with it wow

429
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:45,679
i was flowering with it just for content

430
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,320
to show people that

431
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,599
it doesn't matter you know what light

432
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,000
you got you can do

433
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,360
whatever you want with it yeah and i've

434
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,559
got a really good video it's

435
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,959
uh two pounds of plant finished dried

436
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,039
plant

437
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,319
from t5 from fluorescent lights is what

438
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,078
it's called

439
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,000
and i just kind of wanted to show people

440
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:07,039
that you know whatever you had

441
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,600
you could finish runs with

442
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,519
and uh that was that was kind of the the

443
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,399
reason that i bought that giant

444
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,839
that giant t5 light and for new people i

445
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,879
like to tell them to get

446
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,600
t5s they are the most forgiving light

447
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,159
that you could that you could be under

448
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,240
and uh

449
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,439
will it cost you some end yield of

450
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,278
course of course

451
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,480
t5 spreads it out but at the same time

452
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,399
if

453
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,920
if you're burning your plants up it

454
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,480
doesn't matter how nice of a light you

455
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,078
have

456
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,440
if you're killing your stuff by blasting

457
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:38,559
it with too much light too soon it

458
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,800
doesn't matter what you have

459
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,799
you're killing your plant the equipment

460
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,639
it doesn't matter anymore

461
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,919
so you know i just kind of but i grow

462
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,198
with t5s

463
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,679
leds i don't care i'll grow with

464
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,319
anything i don't i'm not i don't i'm not

465
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,399
picky

466
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,680
whatever i have if that's what that they

467
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,480
want me to grow with i'll put that in

468
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,519
the tent

469
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,959
i can i can figure it out i like how you

470
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,000
mentioned that you do it for content

471
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,078
because

472
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,278
that you know a lot of a lot of viewers

473
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,000
don't really realize

474
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,759
that some of us content creators will do

475
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,639
certain things specifically for

476
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,240
content you know so you yeah exactly

477
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,278
like with like co2

478
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,159
i don't hardly ever run co2 but uh like

479
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,838
tnb they had contacted me in the past

480
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,600
just because i already can grow the

481
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,320
plants will produce so much already when

482
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,199
i add co2 to it it just ups my yield

483
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,720
and i have i don't need it you know i

484
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,159
just don't need the extra but

485
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,560
you know if somebody's gonna send me

486
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,120
stuff and and pay me i'll put it in the

487
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,479
tent

488
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:40,159
but i don't i don't need the co2 because

489
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,759
i already get enough yep but you know

490
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,399
contents content i like trying to try

491
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,000
and be as honest as possible

492
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,078
whenever i'm on that whenever i'm

493
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,120
whenever i'm on stream i figure there's

494
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,000
enough

495
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,198
uh you know lying on on videos already

496
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,480
not just in this

497
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,799
in any that's it's anywhere so i try to

498
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,320
be

499
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,159
upfront and honest with people i don't

500
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,240
like to tell people my plants

501
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,600
are a young age when they're actually

502
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,039
way older

503
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,879
i don't like to do any of that i'd like

504
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,000
you know if they they're three weeks

505
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,399
they're three weeks if they're nine

506
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,639
weeks

507
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,000
they're nine weeks you know i just try

508
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,919
and be honest and up front with

509
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,679
everybody and have a good time

510
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,439
yeah makes sense now what about some

511
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,758
some other equipment so maybe um you

512
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,040
know

513
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,959
how many oscillating fans are you

514
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,679
running inline fans you have to run a

515
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:27,119
dehumidifier a humidifier

516
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:29,039
uh with the uh let's see on the big

517
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,560
tent obviously it's gonna have way more

518
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:31,679
fans than the littler tents on the big

519
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,638
tent i have uh

520
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,679
two six inch fans that sit at the top

521
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,759
just kind of keep some

522
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,198
air circulation up there and i have an

523
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,919
ac infiniti

524
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:43,599
uh the six series cloud line whatever

525
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,000
the one with the controller is

526
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,839
nice i think that's the s series maybe

527
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,278
well there's the t6 i believe is the one

528
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,199
with the controller okay then it's the

529
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:51,600
t-series s-series is the manual one i

530
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,159
guess

531
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,920
so it's the t-series with the controller

532
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,278
and i got that up there

533
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:58,639
i tell you what i didn't even put the

534
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,320
pre-filter on it because the filter

535
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,680
looks so freaking cool you know they're

536
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,199
black and chrome i

537
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,240
couldn't bring myself to put i was like

538
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:05,519
this is going to shorten the life but i

539
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,558
was like this thing looks so cool i

540
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,439
can't cover it

541
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,399
right it's all black and chrome looking

542
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,038
on my pants

543
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,798
it's beautiful but i got two fans you

544
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,480
know two like six inch hurricane fans

545
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,240
sitting up top just attached

546
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,759
just pushing the air you know

547
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,240
circulating some air i don't like dead

548
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:24,240
space air i have a tower fan

549
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,359
i think a tower fan is probably my

550
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,759
favorite fan

551
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,639
for groves i put them right down there

552
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,519
in the canopy

553
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,880
it has a blade of air that as the plant

554
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,079
gets taller you know that air

555
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,320
circulation

556
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,000
it stays just it has that straight

557
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:41,119
column of air

558
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,720
that constantly goes through the canopy

559
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,119
i think a tower fan is probably my

560
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,960
favorite of all the fans and then i have

561
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,798
like a 12 inch fan that just stays

562
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,640
underneath the canopy

563
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:53,279
and just rotates around down by the pots

564
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,919
i don't want stale stagnant air

565
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:58,839
and water anywhere together so i just

566
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:02,640
want constant air circulation

567
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:04,079
um as far as relative humidity this is

568
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,799
where a lot of people on youtube yell at

569
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,720
me i just don't

570
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,160
i don't ever you know in the summertime

571
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,960
it's way different than in the winter

572
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,279
time

573
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,600
and i don't like adding uh humidifiers

574
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,720
or dehumidifiers or anything

575
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,918
unless i'm drying if i'm drying and

576
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,880
curing it's really the only time i pay

577
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,880
attention to

578
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,880
relative humidity i get a lot of flack

579
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,320
on that in my comment section

580
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,000
there's a couple videos where i'm taking

581
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,599
hammers and just blasting apart

582
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,038
high grow meters i'm like you just don't

583
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,918
don't even worry about it unless you've

584
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:31,599
got problems

585
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,520
you're fine you know so i get a lot of

586
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,918
flack on that but once again

587
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,519

589
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:42,079
so stressed out

590
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,678
about oh well my room's only 60

591
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,519
relative humidity and they were trying

592
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,320
to get to 40 percent

593
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,440
stop stressing out about it relax is it

594
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,038
the end of the world do you have mold

595
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,279
problems you got any kind of problem no

596
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,960
all right don't worry about it

597
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,720
you got problems you have problems

598
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,279
showing up okay now we can worry about

599
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,880
it

600
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:03,279
you know i just i try and de-stress

601
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,520
every situation that i can and simplify

602
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,279
it as much as i can

603
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,519
can that stuff help you in the future

604
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:13,200
yeah but when you're starting out

605
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:15,918
you know relax calm down

606
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,720
keep it simple simple man i try to do

607
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,640
the kiss mess

608
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:23,759
kiss method with everything nice

609
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,038
now you do grow in soil coco coir

610
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,160
hydroponics

611
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,119
i am strictly soil uh what i like to

612
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,200
tell everybody

613
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,439
whenever because i do focus on like

614
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,080
brand brand new people is who my channel

615
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,798
is mainly focused at

616
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,519
it's it's less steps that you have to do

617
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,240
because

618
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:45,200
i transplant all the time so every time

619
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,919
i tell people every time you transplant

620
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,038
you're feeding the plants again so if if

621
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,440
i can get you

622
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:55,759
to transplant your plants appropriately

623
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,080
most of the time i only feed from the

624
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,679
start of veg to the end of flower

625
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,759
a lot of times i only feed two or three

626
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,280
times the whole grow

627
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,599
i can't remember the last time i fed in

628
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:08,720
veg they it

629
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,918
ro water and cal mag is basically what

630
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,319
they get

631
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,840
all of veg and then whenever i

632
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,038
transplant them into flour into their

633
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,918
final pots

634
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:20,160
i'll go from like so i started in veg

635
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,280
and happy frog and then whenever i go to

636
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,480
[Music]

637
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:26,319
flower i'll put them in to ocean forest

638
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,599
and i just let that run out usually it

639
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,158
lasts till about week

640
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,759
three of flower before i start to see my

641
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,919
runoff dropping down

642
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,839
and then i'll start feeding them well if

643
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,280
i've made it to week three of flour and

644
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,798
i cut off nutrients at week six of flour

645
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,639
and then i'd let them just coast out on

646
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:43,279
what's in the what's in the leftover in

647
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,080
the pot

648
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,480
and you know let them fade out naturally

649
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,960
it's

650
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,519
one less thing that new growers have to

651
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,360
concern themselves with

652
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,879
is the nutrients because the amount of

653
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:58,079
questions i get

654
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,159
on nutrient schedules oh my goodness

655
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,519
i'm like listen i can help you avoid all

656
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,080
of it

657
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,879
i'm gonna let just just transplant

658
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,038
constantly

659
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,880
into you know as soon as you outgrow

660
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,720
your pot put it into a new one

661
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,640
that's break you've just fed it again

662
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,440
you don't have to concern you don't have

663
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,600
to get so

664
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,880
worked up you know i did a video where

665
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,719
i'm taking all the nutrients i'm just

666
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,520
throwing them off the table into a trash

667
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,079
can i'm like hey

668
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,639
just you can if i can tell you a way to

669
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,199
eliminate

670
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,080
30 of your headache why wouldn't you

671
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,480
take it

672
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,158
because it's gonna come out great now

673
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,839
can you add stuff in there

674
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,600
as long as you're not burning your stuff

675
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,038
up with too many nutrients

676
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,959
yeah can it will help of course but

677
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:39,119
whenever you're brand new

678
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,480
the less steps you got to do is the less

679
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,479
often you know it's the less chance you

680
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,360
have to mess one of them up

681
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,240
that's it you know simplicity once again

682
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,279
that makes sense

683
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,400
yeah so uh happy frog in the beginning

684
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:51,678
and then you'll eventually work your way

685
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,880
into ocean forest

686
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,240
uh one thing that was interesting about

687
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,120
that is that you said you get all the

688
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,880
way up into week

689
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,319
three of flour so my question for you

690
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,840
now is

691
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:04,158
what size grow pots are you using like

692
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:05,439
um i do transplant multiple times you

693
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,799
start in like a solo cup then go to like

694
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,240
a one gallon then to

695
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:09,839
like a five gallon or seven gallon or

696
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,319
what what are you using for yeah

697
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,558
i actually start in root riot plugs okay

698
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:17,439
whenever they're in the germination dome

699
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:19,279
uh and then i'll move into solo cups

700
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,279
after like three weeks in the queue i'll

701
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,759
move them into solo cups

702
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,440
and then i i hate the solo cup stage i

703
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,759
over water them i can never get the

704
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,440
feeling right it seems like

705
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,558
i'm constantly messing up in the solo

706
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,480
cup stage so i want to keep them in the

707
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,158
solo cup stage for like a week or two

708
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,839
and then i'll just transplant them right

709
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,039
into a one gallon pot once i'm in the

710
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,279
one gallon

711
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:40,960
i feel at home i'm good i know my

712
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,319
weights i can pick them up i know when

713
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,840
to water

714
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,119
i know how long they i know what they

715
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:46,798
play i know what they need when it's

716
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,399
once they hit one gallon i'm smooth

717
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:51,599
sailing once i get them out of the

718
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:55,280
out of the dome out of the solo cups and

719
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:56,798
into the one gallons and a weight just

720
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:59,200
drops off the back of my shoulders once

721
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:01,519
i'm out of those terrible solo cups

722
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,679
but i'll go from the one gallon and then

723
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,119
depending on where i'm going to flower

724
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,400
them out because some sponsors

725
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,439
like uh you know want me to flower veg

726
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,919
and flower

727
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,679
in their tent so i can't always come out

728
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,880
of the two by four sometimes i have to

729
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,640
stay in

730
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:21,520
the two by four four veg and for flour

731
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,960
so that's going to determine what size

732
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:24,319
pots i'm going to be in

733
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,400
and it's also going to depend on the

734
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,480
number of plants i'm running

735
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,600
if i'm running if i'm in a two by four

736
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,679
and i'm running

737
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,038
you know three to five plants i'm only

738
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,679
going to put them in

739
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:38,000
in three gallon pots if i'm running you

740
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,400
know two plants or one plant i will

741
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,679
transition from a one to a three to a

742
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,679
five

743
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,278
and i don't ever go over five gallons

744
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,559
even if i'm in the even if i'm in the

745
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:48,798
big one

746
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,399
five gallons is a is a ton of soil could

747
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:52,720
i step it up maybe

748
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,679
to a seven i just don't want to deal

749
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,839
with it

750
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,200
i don't want to deal with that much soil

751
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,720
you know the bigger pots

752
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,798
bigger water you know it's more water

753
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,839
it's just it's just more and more more

754
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:06,079
i dislike more i want less less less

755
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:08,158
whenever i'm doing something

756
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,519
that makes sense so i assume that uh

757
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,600
well i shouldn't assume but

758
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,119
um are you in plastic containers all the

759
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:14,959
way through or you is your final

760
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,278
container like a fabric pot or whatever

761
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,360
you know

762
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,880
it actually depends on what i have if i

763
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:21,119
have fabric pots

764
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,559
i put them in fabric pots i'm not once

765
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,239
again i'm not

766
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:25,678
i don't really doesn't bother me either

767
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,599
way i'll do

768
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,120
i'll do plastic one gallons plastic

769
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,000
three fab i prefer

770
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:34,558
fabric but if i don't happen to have any

771
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,720
which happens to me quite often actually

772
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,399
the plastic pots you know rinse out and

773
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,960
you can use them again

774
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,798
with the fabric pots i found a really

775
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,919
simple way to to get them out of there

776
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:45,599
is i just

777
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,520
razor knife around the edge of the thing

778
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,959
and just peel it off like a banana

779
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,720
because the roots grow into it so much

780
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,319
it can make it a pain in the butt

781
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,400
but the bigger plants like with like if

782
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:55,678
you're in a three gallon or something

783
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,200
the last thing you want to do is be

784
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,679
trying to peel that thing off you know

785
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,720
pull that

786
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,880
get that thing out of there with the

787
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,640
roots all grown into it we're going from

788
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,679
a three to a five

789
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,080
uh so for my final i usually try and be

790
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,600
in a fabric but if i don't have one

791
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,519
i don't really it doesn't bother me

792
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:14,639
either way so

793
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:17,519
i do prefer the fabric though

794
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,038
because like whenever you pull one out

795
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,000
of a fabric pot

796
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:23,200
you don't have the coiling of the roots

797
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,319
around there because they grow they hit

798
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,840
the edge of the pot

799
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,079
and then they air prune themselves and

800
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:29,519
then they grow out differently

801
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,199
when you're in the plastic and you pull

802
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,679
them out it looks so much

803
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,558
cooler because you pull it out you got

804
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,600
just the

805
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:38,879
roots everywhere it looks fantastic you

806
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:41,119
pull them out of the

807
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,000
fabric and it's just like a big bundle

808
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,439
of dirt

809
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,519
mess yep yep but it does it looks way

810
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,798
cooler coming out of the plastic but i

811
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:49,519
don't i mean i don't really care either

812
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,599
way i'll

813
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,960
i'll do it in both yeah i'm the same way

814
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,359
i use both plastic

815
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,278
and uh fabric pots whatever whatever i

816
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:58,879
kind of have on hand or feel like using

817
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:00,319
for that grow and yeah like i mentioned

818
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,679
before it's for content right if i'm

819
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:02,960
doing the same thing over and over and

820
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,798
over again and all my videos well then

821
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,519
people are getting bored of my content

822
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,960
and click off so trying new things using

823
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,639
new methods

824
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,558
just to show the audience that it can be

825
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,400
done so many different ways so yeah

826
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,798
i mean like i usually i'm always like

827
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,840
scrog the plants out that kind of stuff

828
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:21,679
uh i did a video series where it was uh

829
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,798
i called it the punji pit of death

830
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:27,038
series it was all the bamboo stakes

831
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,639
i didn't use the scrog and i just i

832
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,240
tried to control them and hold them all

833
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,159
up with the stakes i hated it

834
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,440
but you know i i like scrogging my

835
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,320
plants out i like that

836
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,679
once again the level of control i get

837
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:40,879
from it

838
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,400
is uh i find it way more to my liking

839
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,840
than with the punji pits it's just

840
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,600
they're a lot harder to control without

841
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:46,959
the scrog there to keep everybody tied

842
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:48,879
down

843
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,640
because i like uniformity i like the

844
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,840
control of it i like everybody

845
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,360
even and flat across my grill

846
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:56,480
it definitely helps maintain an even

847
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,079
canopy when you're bending those

848
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,679
branches down you just have that flat

849
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:01,199
net to kind of tuck things up here and

850
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,640
stuff for sure i love it

851
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,240
i think a lot of people the downside

852
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,278
they say is like okay now what do you do

853
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,880
you have to like crawl

854
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:08,480
under in order to kind of water the

855
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,320
plants behind so it does have like a

856
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,558
downside on that avenue right it does i

857
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,439
actually uh whenever i had the tent with

858
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,960
only the

859
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,759
with only the one entrance uh i had a

860
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,679
system of

861
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,200
metal poles that i would hook onto my

862
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,640
water jug and i would just slide the

863
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,720
poles through the

864
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,640
through the canopy to the back ones and

865
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,960
water it those days are over

866
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,038
the uh my you know my gorilla tint opens

867
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,319
completely up so i can get to the plant

868
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:35,359
i mean it literally the

869
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:37,119
it peels to 180 degrees and just the

870
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,678
back wall is the only one that stays up

871
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,158
it's the

872
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,840
most fantastic thing not like a little

873
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,919
door that opens the whole tent just

874
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:48,480
peels off the whole sides

875
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:50,720
it's fantastic it's worth every penny

876
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,079
uh so you mentioned watering what type

877
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,798
of water do you use use

878
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:56,079
reverse osmosis tap water well water

879
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,359
distilled

880
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:03,359
my tap water here before my water

881
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:05,839
softener is 430 ppm yeah mine is 485

882
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:06,959
yeah yeah after the water softener it's

883
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,558
almost a thousand

884
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,399
so mine i i was using just gallons of

885
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,519
distilled water

886
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,558
and uh and i was there's just so many

887
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,398
trips

888
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:20,079
to the grocery store getting gallons of

889
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:23,038
water i just broke down and bought an

890
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,480
ro machine once again best money i've

891
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:25,839
ever i don't like to spend

892
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,278
crazy amounts of money on everything

893
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:28,398
because i like to try and keep it simple

894
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,200
of course

895
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:33,038
but there's some things when you're

896
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,600
growing like that tent

897
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:37,278
uh that are worth every single penny

898
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:40,719
there are some things that you just need

899
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:42,079
like buying a proper ph and ppm pin

900
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,519
just do it you don't want to be

901
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:44,158
constantly messing with stuff wondering

902
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:46,720
if it's right

903
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,440
or not there's certain areas just spend

904
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,240
the money

905
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,480
it's worth it yeah i agree i have one of

906
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,000
those ro systems underneath my kitchen

907
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,519
and uh you know not only use it for

908
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,640
drinking water clean drinking water

909
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:58,319
you know i don't have to buy a bottled

910
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,360
waters anymore so i saved money there i

911
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,439
did the savings

912
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,759
the calculation just calculating what i

913
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,798
would consume in bottled water versus

914
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:09,599
my ro system i spent about 250 dollars

915
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:11,119
per year on this system right there all

916
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:12,480
right yeah exactly right ro system i

917
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:13,278
think was like 175 or something like

918
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,319
that so

919
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:16,880
that's why one year it's an expensive

920
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:19,918
piece

921
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,080
and whenever i'm talking to new growers

922
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,278
uh it's an expensive because they when

923
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:24,879
they think of spending money they want

924
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,839
to spend it on their life

925
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,640
and i'm like i'm telling you this ro

926
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:30,798
machine

927
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,880
they're worth every penny i don't care

928
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:36,000
you know whichever one you want to get

929
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,880
they're fantastic i like once again the

930
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,398
control

931
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,480
it brings me i know exactly what that

932
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:45,439
plant is getting so let's say you've had

933
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,558
300 ppm or 250 ppm from your tap water

934
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,240
what is it

935
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,158
i mean it's probably calcium magnesium

936
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,558
but you don't know there's a lot of

937
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,679
fluoride or whatever else in there too

938
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:57,359
i just like knowing exactly what i'm

939
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,360
giving my plant

940
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,798
i think they're happier because of it

941
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:03,199
yep yeah i agree

942
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:05,278
i can build my nutrient profile not

943
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,000
whoever

944
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:08,398
so what do you use for nutrients uh you

945
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,880
know

946
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:11,519
basically whatever's on on sale but it's

947
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,880
mainly just

948
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,639
general hydroponics three-part okay

949
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,159
that's what i started with i know it

950
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,360
really well but

951
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,960
once again if you know if a

952
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,558
of a place came on board said we want

953
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,480
you to use our nutrients

954
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:28,158
you know i figured out it's not a big

955
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,599
deal a nutrient profile is a nutrient

956
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,520
profile give me a week with it i'll have

957
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:32,639
it i'll have it squared away

958
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,278
now you following the general

959
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,120
hydroponics nutrient schedule that they

960
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:38,720
put out on their website or do you uh do

961
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,599
a half dose or what do you do for that

962
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,759
depends if i'm growing autoflowers

963
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:44,879
i don't give them full doses of anything

964
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,519
ever

965
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,799
i'm 50 to 20 i'm 25 when they're when

966
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,119
they're little and i'm 50

967
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:51,839
when they're older and i don't feed them

968
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,599
every week

969
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:54,879
because once again i'm in soil i don't i

970
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:58,398
don't need to

971
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:01,840
uh with the with my photo periods i do

972
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:04,319
grow them rather big healthy plants

973
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:05,599
i'll follow it if i'm feeding that week

974
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,319
i'll just follow whatever the

975
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,678
whatever their chart says and then uh if

976
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:11,599
i need to add

977
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,320
you know add to something else or mix it

978
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:16,798
up a little bit i will but generally

979
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:17,678
once again i keep it simple got it did

980
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,038
you monitor

981
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,600
like the ph and the ppm or ec values at

982
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:24,879
all or

983
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:26,879
i i'm super strict on my ppms i don't

984
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,799
ever like feeding more than

985
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,960
if my bigger plants more than like 600

986
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:32,558
650 at a time

987
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,159
i found that whenever i go over that

988
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:36,158
i'll start to get my you know the tips

989
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,399
my leaves will start to turn that brown

990
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,919
and start to get a little nutrient burn

991
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,678
uh but then again it's you know

992
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,278
feeding is just it's not something i do

993
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,440
a lot of you know i have

994
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:47,038
bottles of nutrients that i've had for a

995
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,399
year or two they'll start to crystallize

996
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,398
on the bottom before i

997
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:51,518
get through the if i buy the big bottles

998
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:53,518
they'll start to crystallize on the

999
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,200
bottom before i even get through it

1000
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,200
just because i you know growing in soil

1001
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,558
you just it's a step that

1002
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,000
you don't have to pay that much

1003
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:01,278
attention to because you're not feeding

1004
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,798
a ton

1005
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:06,558
um the main things i really like is i

1006
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,798
i constantly give microbes my

1007
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:12,000
mycorrhizae

1008
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,319
i will go through uh a bunch of this

1009
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,599
stuff

1010
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:15,678
you're doing a soil drench with the

1011
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,519
mycorrhizae are you uh just drinking

1012
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,519
sprinkling on the roots uh well i do

1013
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,720
both both i do both like whenever i

1014
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,960
transplant

1015
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,640
i'll sprinkle it on there i'll maybe

1016
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,120
throw some granular version

1017
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,759
in the in the pot whenever i transplant

1018
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,079
or

1019
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,919
and then any time i'm watering i feed

1020
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:32,720
the i give them mycorrhizae every two

1021
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,440
weeks

1022
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,240
from the from the start till week six of

1023
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,840
flour

1024
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,319
every two weeks they get more drenched

1025
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:44,720
mycorrhizae and then i just throw some

1026
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:46,398
like floral blend or some kind of like

1027
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,399
you know plant food you know or some

1028
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,398
kind of food for them to eat

1029
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:51,918
maybe uh the occasional blackstrap

1030
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:53,119
molasses you know something to keep them

1031
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,278
happy

1032
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,639
and you know just keep it simple what do

1033
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:58,000
you use for um

1034
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,759
do you use a particular brand of

1035
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,440
mycorrhizae or just whatever you have on

1036
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:01,759
hand or what uh you know it's great

1037
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,558
white

1038
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:06,158
great mainly that's pretty much what

1039
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,158
every all the growth stores around here

1040
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,720
have i'm pretty lucky i have like seven

1041
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,360
grow stores within a 40-minute drive of

1042
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,558
me

1043
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:17,278
it's been pretty fantastic since the uh

1044
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:18,720
since our state went legal the amount of

1045
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:20,960
gross stores it used to be

1046
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,640
i had to just order it and now they're

1047
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,240
they're freaking everywhere

1048
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,519
and they're you know the grow stores are

1049
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,159
a little bit more expensive but i

1050
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,720
happily

1051
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,559
go to them i gotta you know i like

1052
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,600
supporting the business

1053
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:35,918
and in local brick and mortar shops so

1054
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:36,879
i happily go into all of them and buy

1055
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,480
different stuff

1056
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,080
at different ones but it's mainly great

1057
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,399
white you know

1058
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,558
a little black strap and some in some

1059
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:46,479
general hydroponics three part

1060
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:48,158
uh what i use the most of it's probably

1061
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,919
a cal mag bottle

1062
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,679
or the and then towards the end of

1063
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,080
flower mag sulfur i burned through that

1064
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,440
stuff

1065
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:56,720
so fast you know it it goes through 100

1066
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,519
times the rate i use

1067
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,200
the regular npk stuff now for the

1068
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,200
blackstrap molasses

1069
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,319
um what do you use what do you do for

1070
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,640
like a dosage per

1071
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,639
gallon of water for example i you know i

1072
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,159
just get it i just pour some in

1073
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,280
okay i can measure it i just get a

1074
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:16,320
couple glug glugs and call it a day

1075
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,760
i'm not you know big on you know being

1076
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,559
super strict with that kind of stuff

1077
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,159
because yep

1078
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:22,078
it's not who cares if you give it a

1079
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,320
little bit too much you know so the the

1080
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,560
microbes to get a little bit extra fat

1081
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,679
yeah and then just kind of go back to

1082
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:31,039
the the ppm

1083
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:33,358
um you mentioned 600 ppm is that

1084
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,559
going in and do you measure the runoff

1085
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:37,119
ppm as well or

1086
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,960
yeah i measure both because i like to

1087
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,079
see where my plants are at

1088
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,199
if you know if you've got if your plants

1089
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,919
are getting starting to get too low

1090
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,118
usually

1091
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,719
any time when i'm in flower because i

1092
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,000
don't really pay attention to it when

1093
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,519
i'm in veg because they're constantly

1094
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,039
getting transplanted

1095
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:55,519
anytime i'm in flower and i see my

1096
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:58,320
runoff start to dip below like 800

1097
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:59,280
i know it's time to feed if they're up

1098
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,480
anywhere

1099
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,280
over 1200 1300 i just let it go until i

1100
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,358
say my

1101
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,040
my runoff start to drop then i feed them

1102
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,759
which isn't very often

1103
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:11,358
so because i transplant a lot got it so

1104
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,920
you do a runoff test you don't do like a

1105
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:13,838
slurry

1106
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,119
test at all no man i literally just

1107
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:18,559
stick my ppm pin down into the whatever

1108
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,240
my runoff water is

1109
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:21,679
and see where i'm at it's worked good

1110
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:23,838
for me so far

1111
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:24,879
i don't uh i don't i don't get too

1112
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:26,880
complicated with it

1113
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,240
which ppm pen do you use just a cheap

1114
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,400
one off amazon or what

1115
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:32,319
uh you know i have one on my website i

1116
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,358
don't actually know the brand it's all

1117
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,559
you can find it at uh

1118
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:39,679
welcome to thegrowtant.com oh okay cool

1119
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:41,759
and then uh ph do you monitor the ph

1120
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,960
going in or run off or this is another

1121
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,960
thing i get yelled at

1122
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,440
about uh i'm not very strict with my ppm

1123
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,400
i'm in soil i have i you know i did a

1124
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,159
couple of ph

1125
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:57,358
you know um as long as it's above

1126
00:35:54,159 --> 00:36:00,399
5.0 and below 7.0

1127
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:03,519
i give it to the plants what i found was

1128
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,720
it didn't matter i edited it all at 6.9

1129
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,519
for like a month

1130
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,319
and my runoff would still come out at

1131
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:11,519
like

1132
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:14,240
5.8 6.1

1133
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,599
whatever i'm just not that strict with

1134
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,078
it it's one of the things i get yelled

1135
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,119
about

1136
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,400
in the comments so often they're like oh

1137
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,480
you got to be between

1138
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,960
6.1 and 6.3 that's the golden spot

1139
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,079
am i great man if i'm not saying don't

1140
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,880
if you want to be

1141
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,280
that strict with it what do i care i'm

1142
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,519
just

1143
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,160
showing you what how i do it if i'm

1144
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:39,679
above if i'm at 5.1 i feed it

1145
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:41,279
if i'm at 6.9 i feed it

1146
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:42,960
you know i pour it in there it's just

1147
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,000
not something i

1148
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,240
you know i stress too much over

1149
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,599
i don't want to be adding i'm like up

1150
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,639
i'm adding up to

1151
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,000
put some ph up in it i went over 6.3 now

1152
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:55,838
i got to put some ph down

1153
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,280
in it and i'll put some alkaline in the

1154
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,880
i don't wanna you know

1155
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,640
i'll leave all that rollercoaster stuff

1156
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,079
alone i got tired of dumping out buckets

1157
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:04,879
of water

1158
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,800
i just uh you know i don't concern

1159
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,280
myself too much with it if i'm into my

1160
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,320
range

1161
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,640
that i like then i give it to it if not

1162
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,559
then

1163
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:13,679
you know then i'll add some stuff in

1164
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:15,440
there

1165
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:16,719
yeah particularly for growing in in fox

1166
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,039
farm soil uh

1167
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:20,639
you know one thing i noticed is that a

1168
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:22,639
lot of these bags are coming in

1169
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:24,000
low they're coming in at like five point

1170
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:25,199
something ph

1171
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,199
yeah yeah you know how many people work

1172
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,838
i've had them in like mid force wow

1173
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:32,480
yeah um and so me personally i usually

1174
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:34,960
just feed in at like 6.5 6.8

1175
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,159
ph and then it'll slowly drift up over

1176
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,280
time and of course things like the

1177
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:40,078
microbes will adjust

1178
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,079
the ph and the medium as well over time

1179
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:46,400
but that's interesting that you

1180
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:48,160
will feed in uh in within you know 5.0

1181
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,358
to 6.0 ph

1182
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:53,598
because um you know typically that's

1183
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:55,279
said to be a little bit too low when

1184
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,760
growing in soil but

1185
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,880
um you know that you're having success

1186
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,400
with that and i've actually heard about

1187
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,599
other people doing that as well with

1188
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,280
with a lot of success

1189
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,960
yeah you know i've i've done it both

1190
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,839
ways and i've

1191
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,800
i've done it where i went in at 6.1 to

1192
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:11,599
6.4

1193
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,880
you know constantly super was super

1194
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:17,119
strict with it

1195
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,240
i never noticed an end yield difference

1196
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,920
and i was like well let's try it the

1197
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:22,879
other way and then i did grows where i

1198
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,320
only came in at like 5.1 to 5.3

1199
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,920
you know i was super strict with it down

1200
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,838
low and i just

1201
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,920
i didn't notice a difference the only

1202
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:32,159
thing i noticed was

1203
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,960
that what the soil would do with the

1204
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:35,440
runoff

1205
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,599
would change just a little bit you know

1206
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,119
they kind of make their own environment

1207
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,280
and they make it the way they want it

1208
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,838
and they're happy as long as you don't

1209
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,960
you know

1210
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:46,799
fry them with like a with like a 4.0 or

1211
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,920
something that gets everybody angry with

1212
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,440
you

1213
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,480
because i did try that i was like well

1214
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,280
how low can i go there is a limit

1215
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,400
stay out of the force yeah yeah they

1216
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,680
were not happy

1217
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,200
right um okay so let's uh how about

1218
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:02,078
temperature what temperature you usually

1219
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:04,879
aim for

1220
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,359
if i'm comfortable in there i'm fine

1221
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,720
with it

1222
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:10,880
if you know 70s 80s you know

1223
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:13,039
whatever you know once again it's not a

1224
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,640
thing i'm terribly strict with

1225
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:16,320
i've done that video where i'm smashing

1226
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:17,838
the high grow meter up i'm like if it's

1227
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,880
too hot for me in here i don't want to

1228
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:21,039
be in here

1229
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,000
so i stay out of it just keep them

1230
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:23,279
comfortable

1231
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,960
that's what i like to say if they're

1232
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,079
coming if i can be comfortable in there

1233
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,199
they're comfortable

1234
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,200
and we're fine because uh once again the

1235
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:34,319
emails that i get with people with the

1236
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:36,000
the ph are you know phs in there but the

1237
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,280
relative humidity and the temp and

1238
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,719
they're freaking out they're putting

1239
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,480
heaters in there and then running air

1240
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:42,319
conditioners in the daytime and heaters

1241
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,000
at night i'm like

1242
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,400
unless you live in some kind of crazy

1243
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,960
climate don't worry about it

1244
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,200
you know stop stressing so much about it

1245
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,320
i'll get you there to the end yield

1246
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:56,639
just relax calm down

1247
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,800
we can get through this i promise i live

1248
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:00,719
in a desert climate so like summertime

1249
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,519
for example i have to actually implement

1250
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:03,199
a um

1251
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:05,039
air conditioner it's so expensive and

1252
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,358
actually try to take off like

1253
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:08,318
um july and august potentially just try

1254
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:09,838
to like not grow

1255
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:12,239
just because it's just so much easier so

1256
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:15,519
much less money you know spending on

1257
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:17,838
electricity consumption yeah um but uh

1258
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:18,960
but yeah i do regulate i aim for about

1259
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:20,639
82

1260
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,639
leaf surface temperatures kind of what i

1261
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:24,318
read to be ideal

1262
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:26,159
now of course the plant is going to grow

1263
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:27,279
in a different range than that some can

1264
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,318
actually take a little bit

1265
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,720
more than that yeah some can take

1266
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:34,079
less than that just fine i do have a

1267
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,879
heater in my

1268
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,240
grow space i don't like to go below like

1269
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,000
60 uh

1270
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:42,239
fahrenheit and even in the 60s i see

1271
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,239
like some um

1272
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,479
you know the the purpling streaks in the

1273
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:49,679
stems for for

1274
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,400
in the low 60s fahrenheit yeah so i i do

1275
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:53,039
regulate

1276
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,760
on that avenue but um but yeah a perfect

1277
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:55,679
example

1278
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,880
about how you can get away with not

1279
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:58,239
doing uh

1280
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,400
those things you know the plant will

1281
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:01,919
still grow yeah it's still gonna grow

1282
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,280
just stay out of its way

1283
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,280
you know if you're not if you're not

1284
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,680
blasting it with too many nutrients

1285
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,599
smoking it with you know you know

1286
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:11,440
flipping on the lights to full power

1287
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,920
when the plant's still little

1288
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,838
and you know watering just soaking it

1289
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,760
down with water every single day

1290
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:19,279
you'd be surprised how well they'll just

1291
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,760
keep going yep

1292
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:26,480
yeah whereas now can you eventually

1293
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,599
up your yield by by honing in on some of

1294
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,599
these things more

1295
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,800
of course but once again my channel is

1296
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,240
focused at

1297
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,000
very beginners where i'm just trying to

1298
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,959
get them through i'm trying to get them

1299
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,719
through

1300
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,400
they've been getting maybe five to ten

1301
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,118
percent of what their plants

1302
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,639
could yield and if i can bump you from

1303
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,160
five to ten percent up to seventy

1304
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:45,358
percent i've never had a single person

1305
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:46,879
that was mad at me

1306
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:48,719
yeah i've mentioned certain humidity

1307
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,559
levels on my channel in the past

1308
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:51,838
and um you know i'm just like you where

1309
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:53,039
it's kind of just a general range for

1310
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:54,639
beginners because i do have a lot of

1311
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:56,400
people that are following what i do

1312
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:58,799
and um one of the things that a lot of

1313
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,200
people are are shifting towards

1314
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,318
is vpd right so i'm not sure how much

1315
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:05,358
you know about vpd

1316
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:06,079
but vpd is a differential scientifically

1317
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:09,119
proven

1318
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,880
method for um humidity and uh

1319
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,800
typically that calls for a higher

1320
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,079
humidity and i've gotten flack on my

1321
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,039
channel in the past where i had said

1322
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,119
like

1323
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:18,079
i can't entirely recommend that people

1324
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,160
chase after

1325
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,560
vpd because it does call for high

1326
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,399
humidity in some instances and if you

1327
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,078
don't have that air circulation going on

1328
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,838
if you have stagnant air if a fair

1329
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,680
fan dies overnight like it's happened to

1330
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:32,318
me you can get powdery mildew

1331
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:33,919
very easily yeah bud rot and completely

1332
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,400
ruin your your crop if

1333
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,760
you have mold in your buds for example

1334
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,800
and that's what happened to me so

1335
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,280
that's kind of my point with it is don't

1336
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,119
chase vpd whenever you're a beginner

1337
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,480
once again i'm speaking to beginners if

1338
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,400
you've been growing for 10 years

1339
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,318
keep doing what you're doing but if

1340
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,240
you're a beginner

1341
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,759
mold's going to ruin your grow way

1342
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,399
faster

1343
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,119
than vpd because if you're a beginner

1344
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,480
most likely

1345
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,318
you're going to over water your plants

1346
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,639
everybody does it you can't really

1347
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:03,679
i don't know everybody just does it but

1348
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:05,838
powdery mildew

1349
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:06,879
is going to ruin your entire garden way

1350
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:09,119
faster than if you're

1351
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,800
not paying attention to keeping your vpd

1352
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,880
perfect

1353
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,960
i get yelled at a ton about that on my

1354
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,960
uh i generally don't even talk about it

1355
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,800
uh so co2 uh you think you mentioned

1356
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:23,679
earlier that you don't do any

1357
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,560
type of co2 you don't do anything it

1358
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:27,679
makes

1359
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,159
it it ups my yield by about 15 to 20

1360
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,838
percent

1361
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:34,000
and i already get too much to begin with

1362
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:35,759
so what am i gonna do with an extra you

1363
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,280
know four or five ounces

1364
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,880
whenever i'm having trouble getting

1365
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,240
through the two pounds i just cut down

1366
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,119
anyway

1367
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:45,118
so i i generally don't run it if a

1368
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,480
sponsor sends it in there or if i want

1369
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,400
to show people

1370
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,559
the kind of the benefits of adding it in

1371
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,160
the videos then i'll put it in there but

1372
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:54,719
other than that

1373
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:56,399
not really got it now what about plant

1374
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:57,679
training you had mentioned you you like

1375
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,240
to do a trellis nat

1376
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,519
uh you use steak sometimes do you do any

1377
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:04,078
you know low stress training

1378
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:05,199
super cropping um what do you do for a

1379
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,359
train plant training

1380
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:08,639
i am well scrog whenever they go into

1381
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:10,719
flower but my main

1382
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:12,480
plant training techniques is topping

1383
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,399
filming and super cropping that is

1384
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,240
my bread and butter that's where i

1385
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,039
that's where i get all my plant training

1386
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:19,439
from

1387
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:21,199
i'm just i'm not a big fan of uh the

1388
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,720
wire ties and stuff

1389
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:26,879
i found with with topping my plants uh

1390
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:28,318
they grow so many branches so fast i

1391
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,039
didn't really want to have like

1392
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:31,519
30 wire ties running around the plant

1393
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:33,920
just because

1394
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:34,800
the plants will branch out so fast so

1395
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,519
fast

1396
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,359
so i'm mainly just topping and super

1397
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:40,239
cropping i'll top the plants super crop

1398
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:41,838
the top of the

1399
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:43,919
top half of the plant down to let the

1400
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:45,759
the lower half catch up

1401
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,880
and usually after a few weeks you know

1402
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,560
two or three weeks of that they're ready

1403
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,720
to flip the flower anyway so

1404
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:52,159
uh now what about i know actually i

1405
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:54,000
didn't i don't know this but

1406
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:55,199
um i think you're primarily indoors

1407
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,760
you're only growing indoors you don't

1408
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:57,279
grow

1409
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,720
yeah they don't let me grow outdoors

1410
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,319
here it's funny they're like if you want

1411
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:01,279
to grow outdoors you have to build a

1412
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:02,559
building

1413
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,000
and to grow outdoors i'm like well

1414
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:05,440
that's called indoors and i already have

1415
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,039
it

1416
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,440
um so so indoors let's talk about ipm

1417
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,480
um now indoors we have the luxury of of

1418
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,318
not having to do

1419
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,920
as much yeah we can kind of get away

1420
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:17,199
with doing doing a little bit less when

1421
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,800
it comes to ipm

1422
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:20,239
do you do anything in particular to

1423
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,839
prevent pests

1424
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:23,439
uh yeah i do actually a couple things

1425
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:26,880
the the main thing is i

1426
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:29,280
always dry out my soil whenever i get my

1427
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,358
soil out of the bags

1428
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,040
if i don't dry it out there's i've got

1429
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:34,400
videos of it i'll take it and i'll get

1430
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:36,719
it out of the bags is the first thing i

1431
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,240
do because those bags hold in moisture

1432
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:40,159
and i'll take it out of the bags i'll

1433
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:41,759
throw it into like a big like uh

1434
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:43,199
like tub wear tote you know like one of

1435
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,640
the really big totes

1436
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,399
i'll dump it in there and then i just

1437
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:48,159
slide it under the exhausting

1438
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,318
on the side of my tent so that it's just

1439
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:52,879
constantly drying out

1440
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:54,719
that soil and when that soil gets too

1441
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,240
too dry anything that was like fungus

1442
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:57,838
gnats or anything were in there

1443
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:00,159
they lose their food source so they

1444
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,000
either die or leave

1445
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:03,759
so that's the first thing i do is i just

1446
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,199
air out the soil

1447
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,280
you know every day every couple days

1448
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:10,399
i'll go in there and i'll stir it up

1449
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,920
under the vent big big tip here pull it

1450
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,880
out from under the vent before you start

1451
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,119
stirring it up

1452
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,920
otherwise you get giant clouds of soil

1453
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,480
in your face

1454
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,838
so pull it out i stir it up mix the wet

1455
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,800
stuff back up to the top

1456
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:23,519
and i slide it back under there i let it

1457
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,920
i let my

1458
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:27,199
prep like that go for about a week so

1459
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,318
before i know i'm gonna

1460
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:30,879
transplant i'll i'll get my soil i'll

1461
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:32,400
get my

1462
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,240
my new soil and i'll put in those totes

1463
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,000
and start drying it out

1464
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,358
the next thing and pretty much the only

1465
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,119
other thing i do is i

1466
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:41,039
i get i get yelled at about the way i

1467
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,240
say this word because i mess it up every

1468
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:45,199
single time

1469
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:46,559
diatomaceous earth diatomaceous earth

1470
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:49,118
yeah yeah uh it's like

1471
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:51,759
adding razor wire into your into your

1472
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:55,838
soil so after i transplant i top dress

1473
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,720
with the diatomaceous earth and uh i

1474
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:58,559
don't

1475
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:00,318
i think over watering is what leads to a

1476
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,440
lot of your problems with with bugs and

1477
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:03,679
stuff like that

1478
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,720
and i don't ever over water unless i'm

1479
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,799
in solo cups

1480
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:08,879
uh then i still over water and uh

1481
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,440
because i just hate them

1482
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,920
with the diatomaceous earth in there and

1483
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,720
uh just

1484
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,680
keeping big green healthy plants knock

1485
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:18,000
on wood i've

1486
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:19,598
been i've never had a a problem since i

1487
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,079
started doing those just those two

1488
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,680
simple things wow yeah i just actually

1489
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,880
got some diatomaceous earth

1490
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:26,799
for the first time i've never used it

1491
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,440
before so i'm gonna have to potentially

1492
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,440
use

1493
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,039
uh steal your best practice there and

1494
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,880
literally the best thing ever

1495
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:34,558
yeah i do it i do it in my live stream

1496
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,119
so i do a lot of my transplanting videos

1497
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,519
just on

1498
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,960
on my like on like a live stream and

1499
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:39,920
everybody was like what is that yellow

1500
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,358
bag

1501
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,519
that you have sitting next that you're

1502
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:45,199
mixing in because i transplant the you

1503
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:47,358
know the plant into the pot

1504
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:48,480
and then uh they're like how much you

1505
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:50,400
use that's like i don't know

1506
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,000
can i just grab a handful of it and

1507
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,318
sprinkle it all around the pot and then

1508
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,079
top dress it in i'm like that much i was

1509
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:56,480
like i don't measure it i just throw it

1510
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,640
in there

1511
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,159
it's not like it's gonna hurt anything

1512
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:04,078
but it's literally like

1513
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:06,879
adding razor wire into your soil

1514
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,559
and like if i have a time where i've

1515
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,960
i've been slacking in the garden and i

1516
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,720
haven't had time to dry my soil out

1517
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,639
i actually just take a bunch of handfuls

1518
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:15,358
of it throw it in the tote and just mix

1519
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:18,879
it throughout

1520
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:22,000
all the soil not just top dress with it

1521
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:25,039
so i use it pretty much you know

1522
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,239
anytime i'm i've got new soil got it but

1523
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:27,759
it's really interesting

1524
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:29,679
it's really interesting that you dry out

1525
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,240
your soil like that um

1526
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:32,879
you know it's a pretty good tip uh you

1527
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:35,199
know i

1528
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,480
some of these bags of soils come with

1529
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:38,719
with pests right

1530
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,159
almost all of them almost all right

1531
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:42,959
because i grow

1532
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:44,318
i grow in fox armor as well and um it's

1533
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,039
it's kind of a hit or miss for me

1534
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:48,000
some bags like i'll plant in and then

1535
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:49,039
i'll be growing the plant all of a

1536
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,960
sudden fungus gnats

1537
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:52,880
start to arise so i'll have the yellow

1538
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,440
sticky traps and then i'll dry out the

1539
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,559
soil while

1540
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,639
you know while the plant is growing i'll

1541
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:58,079
just dry it out yeah you know won't

1542
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:59,759
water the plant to the point where it's

1543
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,160
kind of underwatered and then

1544
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,280
water the plant and then um you know

1545
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:05,598
pretty much off of like

1546
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,519
one drying out yeah they'll be pretty

1547
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,280
much gone yeah correct they will leave

1548
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:10,880
instantaneously the second they lose

1549
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,800
their food source

1550
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,480
with drying out and if you dry them out

1551
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,039
too much all the eggs and stuff die so

1552
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,800
if you dry them out just one time

1553
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:20,079
they leave now if you start over

1554
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,599
watering again

1555
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,000
they're gonna you know more will come

1556
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,760
back i promise you they will find out

1557
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,519
they will they can smell that you know

1558
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,599
algae and stuff that's growing in your

1559
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:32,800
in your soil and they will come back

1560
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,640
but just by drying it out

1561
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,200
i've found that i've eliminated the

1562
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:38,639
problem because there's been times where

1563
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:40,000
you know i watered one time two days

1564
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:41,598
later i had fungus gnats come out of the

1565
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
dang thing i'm like

1566
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,720
i'm like if they're already in the bags

1567
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,639
i'm like there's

1568
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:48,159
no other explanation and once i figured

1569
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:49,440
that out

1570
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:51,759
it made the world of difference i

1571
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:55,200
haven't bought a sticky trap in

1572
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:58,920
years hmm yeah do you do any sprays

1573
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:01,279
for ipm or not i have a bottle of

1574
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,159
sns-209 that i opened up one time

1575
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,359
whenever i was

1576
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:07,358
uh whenever i first started growing and

1577
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:09,358
since i've started drying the soil out

1578
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:12,159
and adding the diatomaceous

1579
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:13,920
earth got it i got it since i added the

1580
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:15,679
diatomaceous earth uh

1581
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,880
i just call it de usually on the stream

1582
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,000
so i don't get yelled at about the way i

1583
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,480
pronounce it

1584
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,079
uh since i did that that bottle of

1585
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,960
sns-209 just kind of

1586
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,480
sits on the shelf but another thing is i

1587
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,240
don't bring anybody's clones into my

1588
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,920
garden

1589
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:32,558
i think that's the biggest transfer of

1590
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,240
bugs that people get and once they get

1591
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,440
into your house it's almost impossible

1592
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,838
i'll spray the whole house down with

1593
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,599
azamax i don't care

1594
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:41,199
what i don't ever bring anybody's clones

1595
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,318
into my garden there's nothing but i

1596
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:43,519
don't ever hear nothing but horror

1597
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:45,039
stories from that like oh yeah i

1598
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:46,079
wouldn't got these clones and now i have

1599
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:48,719
spider mites

1600
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,240
everywhere i'll burn the house down if i

1601
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:53,118
ever get if i get spider mites i don't

1602
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,719
want nothing to do with it

1603
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,318
that's funny yeah a lot of people don't

1604
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,639
uh realize how well

1605
00:50:56,318 --> 00:51:00,880
it how well it works to just keep things

1606
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:03,519
kind of clean so for me personally uh

1607
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,119
between grows i'll literally wipe

1608
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:06,559
everything down with like a

1609
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,640
bleach cleaning yeah i do bleach

1610
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:11,359
solution and i i

1611
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:13,279
every tint every light every fixture

1612
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:15,920
every chord

1613
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,319
i'm very once again i'm in my control in

1614
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,200
uh

1615
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:20,239
adhd my adhd pays off in this part of my

1616
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:22,239
thing because i'll sit there and i

1617
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:24,078
detail orient clean

1618
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,358
everything in between grows now while

1619
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,519
i'm growing

1620
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:28,719
i do get messy through the week because

1621
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:30,800
you know working

1622
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:32,078
regular full-time job coming up with

1623
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,559
content

1624
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,720
shooting it editing it and then like you

1625
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,400
know i have my family also

1626
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:40,480
it's you know it gets hectic through the

1627
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,760
week and then sundays i spend cleaning

1628
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,760
up

1629
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,800
nice i get a couple more questions for

1630
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,839
you before you end this

1631
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,359
so um new growers you work with a lot of

1632
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:51,759
new growers

1633
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:53,199
primarily your new your channel really

1634
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,839
focuses on the beginner

1635
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:57,358
yeah what advice do you have for someone

1636
00:51:55,838 --> 00:51:59,199
who is just starting to grow for the

1637
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:04,000
first time

1638
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:05,679
calm down don't spend a ton of money

1639
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,119
you on the certain things you can but

1640
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:07,440
don't spend a ton of money right off the

1641
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,880
bat

1642
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,720
so you kind of figure out if this is for

1643
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,160
you know for you you don't need to go

1644
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:15,919
out and buy a two thousand dollar

1645
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:17,358

00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,639
small stuff

1647
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:20,799

1648
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,719
way it's gonna be fine you're gonna get

1649
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,720

and if you ever run into any problems i

1651
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:29,118
put my email up in all my videos

1652

i get about a thousand emails a day as

1653
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,000
anybody can imagine

1654
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,760
anybody that puts their email up in

1655
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,679
every video on the internet

1656
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,000
not all of them nice but most of them

1657
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:39,519
the majority of them are nice

1658
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,039
uh and i try and work through them as

1659
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:43,280
much as i can

1660
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:44,558
but uh if i don't respond to you in a

1661
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,839
few days

1662
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:50,160
send it again because it's been buried

1663
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:50,880
but uh just relax would be my biggest

1664
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:53,519
thing

1665
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,440
don't you don't need to be in your tent

1666
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:57,519
ten times a day

1667
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,358
leave it alone i tell it to say that all

1668
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:01,039
my my videos all the time i said leave

1669
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:03,440
it alone

1670
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:05,358
it doesn't need you on top of it

1671
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,559
constantly messing with it

1672
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:11,598
all day long just relax

1673
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:13,760
leave it in there pretend it's a fern

1674
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,359
in your kitchen how often do you pay

1675
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,520
attention to it you don't you're like oh

1676
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:19,279
it's getting kind of droopy

1677
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:20,400
i need to i need to do something with it

1678
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,680
now you got to do a little bit more than

1679
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,838
that but i'm just you know

1680
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:25,199
i'm just telling you you know just leave

1681
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:27,759
it leave the heck alone

1682
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:28,318
it's a plant but do what it's going to

1683
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,680
do right

1684
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:34,239
yeah just kind of relax and you're going

1685
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:36,558
to be able to start to read

1686
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:37,759
what the plant needs i would rather have

1687
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:39,839
you do way too

1688
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,359
less than way too much because it's way

1689
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:43,440
easier to fix way too less

1690
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:44,880
than it is to fix weight too much you

1691
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,720
know once you you know

1692
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,720
you top it down too much you gave it too

1693
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:50,239
much food it's too late already you

1694
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:52,799
might as well just start over

1695
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:53,358
you know with a non-stunted plant that

1696
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,720
you haven't

1697

1718
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:36,960

1719
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,000

1721
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,519

00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:53,759
don't need anything

1729
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,358
from you because what's going to happen

1730
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,160
is you're going to touch it and you're

1731
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:59,358
going to break it

1732
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:00,879
because you've got giant man hands and

1733
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:02,000
you're going to snap that little thing

1734
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,838
and you're going to hurt it there's

1735
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,679
nothing you can do to it that it can't

1736

movers uh the people there send me brand

1810
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:20,960
new tents that are just designed

1811
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:23,118
for their light movers we've got that

1812
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,599
coming up and uh

1813
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,160
you know just me constantly yelling at

1814
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,440
myself

1815
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:30,399
to relax and slow down and and uh

1816
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,280
deal with all the people that like to

1817
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,280
yell at me on youtube

1818
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,039
well welcome to the grow tent thank you

1819
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:39,199
so much for coming on to my channel uh

1820
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:41,679
this has been a great talk

1821
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:43,199
i think this is kind of a refresher for

1822
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:45,039
a lot of people especially the beginners

1823
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:45,838
to who are trying to overcomplicate

1824
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:47,279
things

1825
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:49,279
um you know to hear somebody with

1826
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,200
experience that really

1827
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,280
takes a pretty big hands-off approach

1828
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:54,798
with a lot of these things that

1829
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,400
you know are constantly being fed to

1830
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:57,920
them that they need to narrow down and

1831
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,960
be real specific on

1832
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:03,358
