1
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,759
what's up everybody if you that don't

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,359
know me my name is chris aka mr growit

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:14,000
and i'm back with another video i have

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,000
the pulse monitor here with me some of

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,240
you may have this and also i have the

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,240
sensor push monitor here a couple of

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,079
them actually and i figured i would do a

8
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,599
video comparing the two so there have

9
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,919
been quite a few people that have hit me

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,840
up in the past a lot of you know that i

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,160
run the sensor push monitor i talk about

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,439
it a lot in many of my videos but some

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,359
people have been asking how does the

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,960
pulse compare to that one so that's

15
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,119
we're going to go over today the first

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,480
thing we'll talk about is the dimensions

17
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,399
weight then we'll get into what the

18
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,759
units actually measure bluetooth first

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,239
wi-fi we'll talk about some of the

20
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,079
features we'll get into the app and then

21
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:48,238
lastly conclusion

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,160
but first big thanks to happy hydro for

23
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,399
sponsoring this video happy hydro now

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,919
has complete grow tent kits and many of

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,320
the kits actually come with my beginner

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,640
girl book the kits consist of ac

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,399
infiniti grow tents an ac infinity

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,600
ventilation system your choice of

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,519
lighting whether it be spider farmer hlg

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,400
the green sunshine company or grower's

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,880
choice so home living soil nutrients

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,439
oscillating fans and more i will leave a

33
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,039
link to happy hydro grow tank kits down

34
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,199
in the description section below and you

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,118
can use coupon code mr grow it for a

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,478
discount on their products

37
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:21,599
so right off the bat you can see that

38
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,478
there are

39
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:28,000
definitely a big difference in size here

40
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:30,799
the sensor pushes 1.75 inches by 1.75

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
inches by 0.65 inches and the weight is

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,600
1.4 ounces the pulse is going to be

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,519
quite a bit bigger actually this

44
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:41,599
measures 4.5 inches by 2.5 inches by one

45
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,519
point one two five inches and the weight

46
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,118
is two point nine ounces you can't

47
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,359
actually hang both of these that's what

48
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,200
i do is i hang them at canopy level

49
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,519
there's a little hole here you can slide

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,759
i usually slide the light ratchet rope

51
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,359
through it tie it and then hang it down

52
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,799
you can do the same thing with this so

53
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,799
it'll be a little bit easier with this

54
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,560
this hole is a little bit small for

55
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,840
battery life the sensor push really has

56
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,640
this one beat it's going to take one of

57
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,079
those smaller

58
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,599
cr2477 batteries and that's gonna last

59
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,280
one to two years according to their

60
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,680
website the pulse is actually going to

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,919
take three double a batteries which is

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,760
gonna last you four months so a lot less

63
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,759
battery life however you can actually

64
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,919
plug in there is a spot you can actually

65
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,199
plug in and then run a line directly to

66
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,719
your wall outlet so you wouldn't have to

67
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,399
worry about batteries at all with the

68
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,000
pulse now what i'm just showing you here

69
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,239
is just a couple different models right

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,639
this is the the pulse one they also have

71
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,159
a pulse pro and then the sensor push has

72
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,839
three models they have the ht1 the ht.w

73
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,199
and

74
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,280
http.xw i think a fair comparison would

75
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,439
be with the ht.w

76
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,120
comparing with the pulse one there are

77
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,479
some features that are different which

78
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,480
we'll go over here in a minute but

79
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,039
that's kind of the closest i would say

80
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,598
so the sensorpush ht1 is their cheapest

81
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,439
model it's going to be at 49.99 current

82
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,439
price i kind of hate mentioning prices

83
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,680
sometimes at videos because they do

84
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,280
change the price so somebody might

85
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,439
comment say hey the price has changed

86
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,199
this information is wrong well yeah

87
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:07,120
expect the price to potentially change

88
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:09,119
right now the ht1 is a 49.99 this is hd1

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,878
right here it's the oldest model that

90
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,439
they have actually bought this one back

91
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,199
in 2017. so i've had it for many many

92
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,039
years still works only we've had to

93
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,759
change the battery i think once on this

94
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,759
one measures the temperature humidity

95
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,158
and i believe now they've changed it so

96
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,679
it can calculate vpd as well maybe

97
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:29,280
dewpoint as well but don't quote me on

98
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,159
that the next model up the ht.w that one

99
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,519
does temperature humidity vpd and dew

100
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,158
point and it's gonna be a little bit

101
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,319
more accurate when it comes to the

102
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,719
temperature and humidity plus or minus

103
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:43,280
two percent for relative humidity and

104
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:46,318
then plus or minus 0.2 degrees celsius

105
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,680
or plus or minus 0.36 fahrenheit the

106
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,919
ht.w is going to run you 64.99 it's a

107
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,920
little bit more expensive than the ht1

108
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,399
and then the

109
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:58,958
htp.xw measures temperature humidity has

110
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,959
vpd dew point and also barometer as well

111
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,519
so air pressure it's measuring current

112
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,959
price on that is 89.99 so of course a

113
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,080
little bit more expensive than the other

114
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,158
models and i believe the

115
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:14,480
htp.xw is a little more accurate as well

116
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:16,319
pulse one is 199. so 199. for the pulse

117
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,199
one it's going to measure the same thing

118
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:22,560
as the sensor push temperature humidity

119
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,400
vpd dew point as well as light intensity

120
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,639
so one additional thing that it measures

121
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,560
here it's not going to be as accurate as

122
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,879
the sensor push unfortunately so they're

123
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,120
reporting plus or minus three percent

124
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,040
for humidity plus or minus one percent

125
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,680
for temperature and then plus or minus

126
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,759
four percent for vpd sensor push did not

127
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,160
mention what their plus or minus was for

128
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,240
vpd so pretty big price difference there

129
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,520
in regards to the units but there's a

130
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,360
good reason for that and that's the

131
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,359
connectivity so the sensor push is

132
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,639
bluetooth only the bluetooth range on

133
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,319
this is 100 meters about 325 feet data

134
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,000
is collected at one minute intervals

135
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,639
also alert ranges can be set for

136
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,160
temperature humidity vpd dew points so

137
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,000
you can be alerted when there is a

138
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,680
problem when things are out of range you

139
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,240
get a push notification directly to your

140
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,400
phone or you can ask alexa which is new

141
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,560
to me i haven't hooked this up to alexa

142
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,038
yet there is a wi-fi adapter for this

143
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,478
it's called the sensorpush g1 wi-fi

144
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,478
gateway and that's gonna run a hundred

145
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:19,478
dollars so good comparison would be the

146
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:22,560
center push ht.w that's gonna run you

147
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:25,599
64.99 plus the wi-fi gateway which is

148
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,839
99.99 so you're looking at about 165

149
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,080
dollars for the sensor push with the

150
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,959
wi-fi capability and again comparing to

151
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:35,359
the pulse it's 199 total this already

152
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:38,239
has wi-fi built in you actually need

153
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,080
wi-fi in order to use this so for my

154
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,319
understanding there's no bluetooth on

155
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,079
this device at all for the sensor push

156
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,159
one mobile device can monitor an

157
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,159
unlimited number of sensors and one

158
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,639
sensor can be monitored by an unlimited

159
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,639
number of mobile devices for the pulse

160
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,439
unlimited number of sensors including

161
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,519
multiple locations and wi-fi networks

162
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,680
viewable on one dashboard i couldn't

163
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,639
find out how long the data is stored for

164
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,038
the pulse but for the sensor push 45

165
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,360
days of storage on the sensor and

166
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,759
unlimited in-app storage for unlimited

167
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,038
devices on their database one thing i

168
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,240
really like the sensor push is you can

169
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:16,399
actually extract the data to a csv file

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,680
so really you can put that into excel

171
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,359
google sheets

172
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,360
other programs like that and then you'll

173
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,879
be able to manipulate the data as you

174
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,720
wish i'm pretty sure you can't do that

175
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,719
with the pulse which is unfortunate i

176
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,720
know a lot of people do like to extract

177
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,720
the data and manipulate it to see

178
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,639
different trends and such okay now let's

179
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,479
take a look at the apps

180
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,918
first up is the sensorpush app you can

181
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:40,079
see right here i have one two three four

182
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,159
different devices loaded up here let's

183
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,120
just click on one of the devices we'll

184
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,960
do

185
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,319
2x4 canopy

186
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,120
you can see it takes a little bit to

187
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,720
load the data not too long

188
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,199
this is actually in my two foot by four

189
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,199
foot grow tent and i'm actually not

190
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,280
using this tent right now so you can see

191
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,680
significant changes in the temperature

192
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,198
and humidity as far as the craft is just

193
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,720
it's pretty big swings there is what i'm

194
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,038
trying to say but you can see a section

195
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,400
for temperature a section for relative

196
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:10,560
humidity a section for vpd as well gives

197
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,638
you a little summary at the bottom there

198
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,720
and then a chance to export the data as

199
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,560
a csv file like i mentioned before you

200
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,560
can see the data by the hour you can see

201
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,360
the data by the day by the week by the

202
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,680
month and even by the year as well then

203
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,598
in the settings you can set a high and

204
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,319
low limit for temperature relative

205
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:30,478
humidity barometric pressure dewpoint

206
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,720
and vpd so you can see for example i

207
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,478
have my relative humidity high set for

208
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,560
seventy percent and low set for forty

209
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,959
percent i don't have the alerts on if i

210
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,280
put the alerts on here i would get a

211
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,038
alert when it is out of range but right

212
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,119
now i'm not using a tent so i'm keeping

213
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,439
the alerts off down here on vpd you can

214
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,199
see i don't have a high or low limit set

215
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,199
but that's something i can easily add in

216
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,199
when i want there's also a spot for leaf

217
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,840
temperature offset which you can see

218
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,000
here and read here the explanation for

219
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,560
that that's pretty much the sensor push

220
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,199
app in a nutshell now let's go into the

221
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,759
pulse monitor app all right there we go

222
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,520
so i just have one pulse monitor you can

223
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,360
see that it looks like there's a battery

224
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,198
alert on there so i have a low battery

225
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,319
need to change that soon just a quick

226
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,919
review of the dashboard see the

227
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,199
temperature humidity

228
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,918
light vpd dew point pressure click in on

229
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,240
that you can see some more data you can

230
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:25,198
see a spectral analysis there's some

231
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,960
settings here change wifi settings vpd

232
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,240
leaf temperature offset you can

233
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,918
calibrate the unit you can also

234
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,360
calibrate on the sensor bush i just

235
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:32,958
didn't show that part usually there's a

236
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,800
graph here i'm not sure why the graph

237
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,879
isn't showing but usually you would see

238
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,038
a graph here see a lot of different

239
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,519
information alert settings it's

240
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,360
definitely a lot more extensive than the

241
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,839
sensorpush app you can do daytime

242
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,680
settings nighttime settings up here you

243
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,839
have a calendar that you can actually go

244
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,000
in and edit you can do different entries

245
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,200
for things that you did new events for

246
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,480
example there are also different

247
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,200
templates here that you can use to

248
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,440
manage settings across multiple devices

249
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,839
up just noticing now you actually can

250
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,000
export the data into csv just like

251
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,440
sensor push so i wasn't aware of that

252
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,799
that's awesome that they have that

253
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,200
because i know there's a lot of people

254
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,879
that really like to extract the data and

255
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,800
manipulate it so they can see different

256
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:16,080
trends and such and that's pretty much

257
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:18,399
the pulse app in a nutshell

258
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,320
so there's a quick comparison of the

259
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,839
pulse monitor versus a sensor push

260
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,600
monitor since the push monitor is going

261
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,440
to be significantly smaller than the

262
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,759
pulse monitor however the sensor push

263
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,160
only has a bluetooth enabled so you have

264
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:32,559
to actually buy a wi-fi adapter if you

265
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,480
want the wi-fi capability pulse monitor

266
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:37,759
already has wi-fi built into it both of

267
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,680
these measure temperature humidity vpd

268
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,958
dew point however with the pulse one

269
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,679
you're actually gonna get light

270
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,039
intensity as well accuracy sensor push

271
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,799
is gonna be a little bit more accurate

272
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,719
than the pulse monitor and then for the

273
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,278
actual app on your phone you're gonna

274
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,519
get more with the pulse app i personally

275
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:56,080
would like to see the sensorpush add-in

276
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,360
co2 monitoring pulse has another monitor

277
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,839
called the pulse pro it has co2 it also

278
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,759
has par measurements in ppfd so i think

279
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,120
the next step for sensorpush would be to

280
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,559
add the co2 and potentially add in ppfd

281
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,560
measurements as well i certainly didn't

282
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,399
go over all of the details for each of

283
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,479
these monitors in this video that would

284
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,759
make this video way too long just the

285
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,360
features that i thought were pretty

286
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,439
important for

287
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,720
monitoring your garden what features did

288
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,000
i miss that you think i should have

289
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,839
mentioned let me know down in the

290
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,759
comment section below which monitor do

291
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,200
you use to use the pulse to use the

292
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,958
sensor push or do you use a different

293
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,959
monitor let me know down in the comment

294
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:33,199
section below links to all the sensor

295
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,518
push models with the wi-fi gateway and

296
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,519
also the pulse one and pulse pro will be

297
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,278
down in the description section below if

298
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,879
i have coupon codes for you i will link

299
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,958
those down in the description section

300
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,958
below and yeah i'll leave it at that

301
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:49,159
thank you so much for watching and until

302
00:10:44,958 --> 00:11:03,609
next time peace

303
00:10:49,159 --> 00:11:03,610
[Music]

304
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,519
you
