1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,480
coming up on garden talk when you have

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,480
the light really close to your canopy

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,080
and you don't have this massive amount

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,800
of infrared spectrum that like an hbs

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,559
say would have

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,160
you're not radiating those plant leaves

7
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,000
and just burning them like a crisp

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,439
and you're also not losing the the light

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,839
spread i think there's a lot of

10
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,759
misconception where people think adding

11
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,839
uv or infrared makes a

12
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,519
massive difference even in small

13
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,719
quantities it really it really doesn't

14
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:25,919
make a big difference when you only have

15
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,919
a tiny little bit of it

16
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,359
light spread is critical if you can't

17
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,279
find a par chart for a light

18
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,559
kind of a red flag to me your plant's

19
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,200
not going to be able to accept

20
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,039
you know a high amount of ppfd if your

21
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,879
environment is not dialed in

22
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,238
your nutrients aren't good to go it's

23
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:41,280
important to make sure that the company

24
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,199
you're buying from

25
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,200
has lab tests done on their fixtures so

26
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,559
that you know that they're not just

27
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,239
making these numbers up there's a lot of

28
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,759
misinformation in the industry and a lot

29
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,078
of manufacturers who aren't afraid to

30
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,079
lie

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,920

my name's austin i work for chill tech

116
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,799
i've been working for chill tech

117
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,039
since january of last year and really

118
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,040
before chill tech i never really had

119
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,719
much growing experience at all i mean

120
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,239
my mother she was someone who always

121
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,239
kind of had a green thumb and

122
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,840
i always found it interesting but

123
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,599
truthfully i was a gear head

124
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,000
and i like building computers i didn't

125
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,598
really spend much time in the garden but

126
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,840
you know starting at chill tech has

127
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:46,719
really it's really opened up my world

128
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,360
it's truthfully i've learned so much in

129
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,479
this just

130
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,959
you know it's been about a year and a

131
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,878
half and i've kind of developed a

132
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,959
passion for plants you know truthfully

133
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,239
all of them i mean for me i really like

134
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,840
pepper plants i think they're really

135
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,000
really fun and exciting and there's

136
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,319
so many different species and you know i

137
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,080
love spicy food so it's kind of fun but

138
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:06,878
i've really just i've discovered the

139
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,400
value of growing so

140
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,318
just been learning more and more every

141
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,799
day but yeah like you said i talk with

142
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,199
people

143
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,879
all the time you know who are looking

144
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,439
for their new grow light and it's

145
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,039
it's it's a tough industry there's a lot

146
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,319
of misinformation

147
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,040
and marketing that is misleading

148
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,560
and you know all these companies they

149
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,000
they really sometimes i feel like focus

150
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,000
on the wrong things

151
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,240
but hopefully i can help do my best to

152
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,360
explain you know because like you said i

153
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,478
talked to a lot of people about these

154
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,720
things so

155
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,478
that's a little bit about me and so uh

156
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,000
we can go ahead and jump right into it

157
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,000
nice yeah and before we actually get

158
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,600
into the nitty-gritty of things austin's

159
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,639
not paying me anything chill tech isn't

160
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,879
paying me anything

161
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,000
i just want to make that clear however i

162
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,159
am affiliated

163
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,160
with chill tech that's a company that i

164
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,720
stand by i have an affiliate

165
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,000
coupon code to where i get referral fees

166
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,080
you can use code mr

167
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,120
grow it to get a percentage off and i

168
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,719

all right let's get into it so uh

192
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,478
talking about grow lights and what

193
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,240
consumers can kind of look for like

194
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:43,599
ultimate buyer's guide what people

195
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,160
should be looking for when

196
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,600
buying a grow light oftentimes i get the

197
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,439
question from people

198
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,360
you know as i think i believe you know i

199
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,680
tested grow lights for

200
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,759
a year year and a half i got my hands on

201
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,600
about 50 different grow lights and

202
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,199
i grew with a handful of them and did

203
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,520
par tests and all that stuff so i've

204
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,680
seen

205
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,279
a lot of different grow lights and so

206
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,240
people often come to me and ask me the

207
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,719
question

208
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,639
what is the best growth light that

209
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,000
question is kind of difficult to

210
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,918
answer it's kind of like asking what's

211
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,680
the best tv well first you want to know

212
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,799
what size tv are you looking for right

213
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,959
you're looking for a 32 inch you're

214
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,960
looking for a 50 inch a 60 inch

215
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,159
uh and then once you find the size you

216
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,198
can kind of really narrow

217
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,400
down uh what you're looking at

218
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,720
so for example if you're looking for a

219
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,679
three foot by three foot grow space if

220
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,880
that's what you have and you want to

221
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,680
cover that area

222
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,639
you can narrow it down right also when

223
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,879
we talk about

224
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,478
coverage area light distance as well

225
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,439
kind of factoring that in

226
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,240
because some of these grow lights you

227
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,600
have to have them

228
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,000
24 inches 30 inches away so if you're

229
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,720
limited on height if you have a height

230
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,918
constraint

231
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,759
right if you're in a grow tent for

232
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,000
example and you got that light all the

233
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,680
way up well what is 24 inches away

234
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,038
and how much space you have for your

235
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,280
plant underneath that

236
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,560
so i feel like coverage area is kind of

237
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,758
like the number one thing that people

238
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,839
should kind of

239
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,879
understand first know first what area

240
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,318
you're looking to cover

241
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,079
and then kind of factoring that light

242
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,759
distance

243
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,120
what are your thoughts on that one yeah

244
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,598
it's really like you said

245
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,680
it's it's important to know the desired

246
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,800
coverage area first that's one of your

247
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,478
the biggest things you need to pay

248
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,960
attention to oftentimes people reach out

249
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,879
and go

250
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,079
what's your best grow light well that

251
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,478
depends you know

252
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,758
they're not all able to fit in the same

253
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,439
grow spaces and

254
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,680
and so for example we could say a two by

255
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,800
four our best two by four light

256
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,360
is the x3 330 and the hanging height for

257
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,199
that we suggest between 12 and 24

258
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,960
but that goes there's a step further on

259
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,439
that you know your best

260
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,638
hanging height it depends on the stage

261
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,639
of plant growth you're at

262
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,879
but one of the advantages of grow craft

263
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,478
is how close you can get to the canopy

264
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,919
without worrying about you know losing

265
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:48,318
that light spread like you mentioned

266
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:50,318
some

267
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,160
some lights have to be at least 24

268
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,520
inches just so that that light can

269
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,759
distribute right

270
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,918
uh whereas growcraft you know it's it

271
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,120
fits right into that two 2x4 that x3 is

272
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:00,560
just it's like a glove

273
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,319
you know just enough room where it's not

274
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,120
touching the walls or anything but

275
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,639
you really have a smooth canopy light

276
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,079
distribution

277
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,680
and you don't have to hang the light

278
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,318
really high which in turn

279
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,199
gives you a lot better penetration right

280
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,479
you know

281
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,960
when you have the light really close to

282
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,800
your canopy and you don't have this

283
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,478
uh infrared the massive amount of

284
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,199
infrared spectrum that like an hp say

285
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:23,038
would have

286
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,800
you're not radiating those plant leaves

287
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,719
and just burning them like a crisp

288
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,079
and you're also not losing the the light

289
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,919
spread so

290
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,758
i guess my suggestion for people would

291
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,598
be is to you know figure out

292
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,360
the the space that you want to have it

293
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,519
in the dimensions

294
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,200
and then basically from there you can

295
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,278
start to determine well you know

296
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,719
which size fixture do i need but then

297
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,039
there's another factor to look at and

298
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,920
that's how many watts per square foot

299
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,838
typically i suggest getting around 35 to

300
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,838
40 watts per square foot

301
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,880
and we hold the standard pretty high at

302
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,800
chill tech

303
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,720
a lot of people might compare it to

304
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,519
other lights and see well i can spend

305
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,278
you know just

306
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,879
this this little amount and get this you

307
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:01,919
know just have just this amount of

308
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,519
wattage

309
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,679
but in reality these companies they've

310
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,600
kind of a lot of them stretch

311
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,439
how far you can really go with a given

312
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,399
amount of wattage at the efficacy that

313
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,320
they have

314
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,759
and so you know we hold the standard

315
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,200
very high and like i said

316
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:20,399
uh like the x3 330 for example in a 2x4

317
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,959
you have about 41 watts per square foot

318
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,320
which is great that's excellent good for

319
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,518
all plants even those really really

320
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,640
light hungry ones

321
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,080
tomatoes and you know really anything

322
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,679
and you you know since it's a dimmable

323
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,360
fixture you know you can always dim it

324
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,278
down but to get back to hanging heights

325
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,399
it really depends on what you're growing

326
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,759
what stage of plant growth you're at and

327
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,200
the fixture that you have

328
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,200
and then kind of getting into other

329
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,920
things that that people look at

330
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,600
par efficacy spectrum those are some

331
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,559
other things that that people look at

332
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,839
and there's certainly an argument some

333
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,159
people prefer

334
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,760
to look at some over the other as far as

335
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,000
importance right some people think par

336
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:00,720
is more important than efficacy for

337
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,159
example some people say no efficacy

338
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,240
efficacy then look at par or some people

339
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,360
might say hey spectrum spectrum's

340
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,720
more than that we'll start looking at

341
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,240
spectrum first then look at power then

342
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,440
look at fskc so

343
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,320
it really comes down to personal

344
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,880
preference let's start with par

345
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,600
par stands for photosynthetically active

346
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,480
radiation

347
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,560
it's the energy that the plants use in

348
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,639
order to grow right so these little

349
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,078
little balls of energy called photons

350
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,199
right that are coming down picture them

351
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,078
as as like rain

352
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,480
coming down right and then the the

353
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,239
density of photons or how fast it's

354
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,680
raining for example

355
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,519
can be measured in like a few different

356
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,000
ways right so there's ppf

357
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,639
and there's ppfd do you want to explain

358
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,879
what those

359
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,759
what those two measurements are for par

360
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,799
yeah so

361
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:49,200
ppf is photosynthetic photon flux

362
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,719
and that's basically the total amount of

363
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,399
light i could say or i guess you could

364
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,519
say total number of photons

365
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,839
that a light fixture outputs and

366
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,120
that's basically how you can use that

367
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,200
number to determine

368
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,440
how much total light a given fixture is

369
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,920
giving out but then you can look at ppfd

370
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,440
which is

371
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,240
uh basically the metric you would see

372
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,519
like a par map shown in for example or

373
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,879
you could see sometimes you'll see like

374
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,078
average

375
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:16,480
ppfd in a given space

376
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,599
and so that's uh photosynthetic photon

377
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,839
flux density

378
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,639
and so that's the amount of photons in a

379
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,079
given area

380
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,919
i guess you could say one square foot

381
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,120
you know has x amount of

382
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:29,120
uh you know ppfd and so that's kind of

383
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,879
the difference between those two um and

384
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,360
like you said they're both in par

385
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,720
and that gets into a whole different

386
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,399
world where a lot of people

387
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,920
aren't familiar with par you know if

388
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,039
you're not you know super familiar with

389
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,838
growing or you're just getting into

390
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,879
growing or

391
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,360
you just really don't know a whole lot

392
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,759
about grow lights in general uh par

393
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,519
is it's basically yeah it's like the you

394
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,720
could view it as like the energy raining

395
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,639
down onto the plants

396
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,839
but it's it's also i like to explain as

397
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,000
the way that

398
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,600
plants see light right or they it's the

399
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,720
energy they can use from that light

400
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,040
as opposed to lumens a lot of people

401
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,639
will reach out and say hey you know i

402
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,240
have a lumen meter how many lumens

403
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,320
should i be at and it's well

404
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,519
you know you can kind of use that a

405
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,079
little bit but that's really that's just

406
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,078
how

407
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:12,319
the human eye sees light and so your

408
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,679
plant isn't necessarily interested in

409
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,879
that so yeah i'm glad you brought up par

410
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,479
and kind of explained par

411
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:17,919
because that's that's half the battle

412
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,720
right there yeah

413
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:22,319
and there are some general guidelines

414
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,959
for measurements that that you should

415
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,600
look for

416
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,559
as a consumer so for ppf some numbers

417
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,360
that i have here

418
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:31,759
if you're in a two foot by two foot area

419
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,480
275 to 375

420
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:36,240
ends up being in micro moles per second

421
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,200
is the ppf measurement

422
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,799
three foot by three foot area 600 to 850

423
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,320
micromoles per second

424
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:46,799
four foot by four foot area 1100 to 1500

425
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,000
micromoles per second five foot by five

426
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,958
foot area

427
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,320
1500 or greater micro moles per second

428
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,319
and those are just general guidance

429
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,360
there's just general guidance some may

430
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,440
watch this and

431
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,720
argue that you know it's going to be

432
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,560
dependent on plants

433
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,759
what plant you're growing like austin

434
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,439
had mentioned but that was a kind of

435
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,958
general guide for what you can look at

436
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,680
for ppf and then when talking about ppfd

437
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:12,159
kind of narrowing it down typically 200

438
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:13,359
to 400 ppfd for seedlings clones and

439
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,838
mother plants

440
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,278
400 to 600 ppfd for plants in the

441
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,760
vegetation stage

442
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:20,879
600 to 900 ppfd for plants in the

443
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,278
flowering stage

444
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,399
and arguably can do more than that you

445
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,958
can go higher than that

446
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,559
if you're supplementing co2 and again

447
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,078
those are just kind of general ranges

448
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,319
that you can go by

449
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:34,078
and looking at the par map there will be

450
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,560
a lot of companies that have a par

451
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,159
map on their grow light listings it'll

452
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,000
tell you at the different distances

453
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,360
whether it be 12 inches away

454
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,440
the grill is 12 inches away from the

455
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,720
plants 24 inches away

456
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,440
30 inches away whatever what those ppfd

457
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,278
numbers are

458
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,279
so growers often will look at those

459
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,399
power maps kind of get an understanding

460
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:54,078
of the light distance

461
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,639
seeing if it will fit within their grow

462
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,638
tent knowing that they have to have

463
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,278
their light this far away and it's going

464
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,440
to give them the adequate amount of par

465
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,278
through the different stages of growth

466
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,079
that's kind of the way i kind of look at

467
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,240
it

468
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,120
and go about it yeah yeah i like that

469
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,959
you mentioned the

470
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,440
the jet that's a general guideline

471
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,958
because it it varies so much

472
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,040
uh plant genetics like you mentioned

473
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,838
plant genetics play a huge role

474
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,639
in how much you know total intensity

475
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,760
that it can take

476
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,159
at each you know stage of growth uh you

477
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,720
know

478
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:28,078
and the co2 is another role but also you

479
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,040
know your plants not going to be able to

480
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,759
accept

481
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,599
you know a high amount of ppfd if your

482
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,838
environment is not dialed in

483
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,120
your nutrients aren't good to go so

484
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,480
that's another thing that i

485
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,759
you know i mentioned to people when

486
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,720
they're trying to pick a grow light for

487
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,639
us

488
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,160
uh you know a lot of people will say oh

489
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,919
i have a 2x4 for example

490
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,198
and they'll go i should just go for the

491
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,838
x3

492
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,479
500 watt right which is kind of our 3x5

493
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,320
light

494
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,680
which you know has a lot more power than

495
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,040
even just the 330

496
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,239
and i kind of say to people you know

497
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:00,000
unless you are supplementing co2

498
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,959
you have everything dialed in you're

499
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,839
really not going to be able to take

500
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,198
advantage of

501
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:08,160
the jump from the x3 330 to the x3500

502
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,519
in a two-by-four space um you've really

503
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,919
got to have things dialed in so i you

504
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,519
know i

505
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,599
say hold on you know slow down a minute

506
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,600
and you don't need to have

507
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,639
way too much light but you know the one

508
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,639
thing to consider

509
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,919
is that all of our fixtures are dimmable

510
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,639
so you can you know from

511
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,319
from five five percent to 100 so you can

512
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,240
always you know adjust that

513
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,278
um but yeah like i said it's good that

514
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,278
you say that's kind of a general

515
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,198
guideline because it does vary

516
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,320
for sure and then kind of looking at

517
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,719
that that light

518
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,839
output right like ppf is a total light

519
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,920
output right but

520
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,360
how much is that is actually hitting the

521
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,240
footprint right your coverage

522
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,639
area and so some people look at the

523
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,480
light

524
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,000
spread across the coverage area that's

525
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,440
something that they consider they take

526
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,320
into consideration when purchasing a

527
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,079
grow light so

528
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,639
the bar style lights that chill has for

529
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,879
example has excellent light spread

530
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,639
across the entire canopy but you get

531
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,120
some other grow lights where it's very

532
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,560
focused in the dead center of the

533
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,198
footprint and that's it so you might

534
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,239
have

535
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,519
900 ppfd in the dead center but as you

536
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,440
see on that part chart or

537
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,879
some companies actually hide their part

538
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
chart they just show that dead center

539
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,000
number

540
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,680
so they look good but as you kind of go

541
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,720
away from the dead center of the

542
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,638
footprint

543
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,560
the light drops off considerably right

544
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,799
you're looking at 900 dead center

545
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,758
but it might be like 200 in the corner

546
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:24,879
having a light

547
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,320
spread evenly across the footprint

548
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,078
is another thing to consider when

549
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,360
looking at lights right yeah yeah

550
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:30,719
absolutely light spread

551
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,039
is very important and like i mentioned

552
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,040
before you know one of the advantages

553
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,399
of growcraft and having the bar design

554
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:37,838
is yeah that's spread

555
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,600
but yeah and the ability to hang it

556
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,920
lower without losing that spread

557
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,600
because yeah if you if you have one you

558
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,599
know a thousand ppfd

559
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,720
in the center but 200 on the edges

560
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,240
you're you're going to get

561
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,079
not a very great yield on those edges

562
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,440
you can have a lot of you know uh

563
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,198
i guess you'd call it larf or really

564
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,480
just like underground stuff because it's

565
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:55,120
just it's not getting the intensity that

566
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,399
it needs

567
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,159
and you're gonna have a really uneven

568
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,039
canopy another thing you'll you'll

569
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,159
notice with some

570
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,639
other style lights the more spotlight if

571
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:04,639
you would

572
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,679
lights or or quantum boards and stuff is

573
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,319
when you have to

574
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,759
you have this centralized area in the

575
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,798
center that's way more powerful your

576
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,519
canopy becomes

577
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,879
very uneven and then you know you have

578
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,480
your center your canopy is getting all

579
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,240
tall and then your edges are short

580
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,360
and it just it makes that even worse you

581
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,880
know right where the center is just

582
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,958
getting more and more light and the

583
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,880
outsides are not so yeah again light

584
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,038
spread very important

585
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,079
uh like you said some companies will

586
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,400
actually kind of hide

587
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,678
their power charts which to me deal

588
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,679
breaker for me because you

589
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,200
you've got to have not only tests done

590
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,000
by the company but also third-party

591
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,919
tests you know

592
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,038
we try to send our fixtures to as many

593
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,720
people as we can

594
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,240
and we don't you know we we don't really

595
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,120
sponsor we just we give them light and

596
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
say you know hey

597
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,399
check this out you know what do you

598
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,599
think test it out because we want to get

599
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,038
people's genuine

600
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,639
test results because you know we're

601
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:52,079
confident that you know we've really

602
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,038
narrowed it down and gotten that light

603
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,519
spread

604
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,038
to be optimal so i agree with you yeah

605
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,480
light spread is critical

606
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,879
if you can't find a par chart for a

607
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,558
light kind of a red flag to me

608
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,760
and we obviously offer par charts for

609
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:05,038
all of our fixtures but also there's

610
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:07,038
plenty of third-party

611
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,879
testing that's been done i had a company

612
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:10,319
hit me up last week

613
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,440
and they sent me there a picture of

614
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,038
their grow lighting like oh we're

615
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,480
looking for somebody to test it or

616
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:15,759
promote the grow light

617
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,599
and so i started asking about the

618
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,038
questions like so what's the par at the

619
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,599
different levels there's no part chart

620
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:23,200
and they said

621
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,199
what's par oh

622
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,440
the conversation ended pretty quickly

623
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,360
there but yeah get out of there

624
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,279
that's funny i've never heard that yeah

625
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,479
yeah what's part wow

626
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,558
there's so many different companies on

627
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,360
the market today that you just

628
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,399
dig into it do your due diligence make

629
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:39,519
sure they know what they're talking

630
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,559
about because there's people at these

631
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,918
companies

632
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,839
and lights that are out there that are

633
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,120
just hot garbage and

634
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,319
uh the people working for those

635
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,879
companies don't know what they're doing

636
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,879
so

637
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,559
yeah it's good to to go with a company

638
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,600
that um actually knows what they're

639
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:53,359
talking about for sure

640
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,519
right yeah that's that's pretty scary

641
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:58,879
not knowing what the car is

642
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:00,798
yeah but uh moving on to uh efficacy

643
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,559
talk to us about efficacy yeah so

644
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,480
efficacy is essentially and layman's

645
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,480
terms how efficiently a grow light can

646
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,200
take input wattage and turn it into

647
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,079
usable par which is what you want this

648
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,960
is like one of the most

649
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,480
important uh you know specifications or

650
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,200
metrics that you can look at for a grow

651
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,160
light

652
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,360
because you could have a thousand watts

653
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,200
but if you have an efficacy

654
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,199
you know below you know let's say you

655
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,798
know one micro per joule

656
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,558
you're not really getting a whole lot of

657
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:27,440
uh output you know in terms of what your

658
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:29,440
plants can use

659
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,120
and so when you have a low efficacy and

660
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,279
a high input wattage you're losing

661
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,798
a lot to heat you're losing a lot of

662
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,200
energy to heat which

663
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,000
heat is basically almost every grower's

664
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,600
worst enemy

665
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,960
unless you're somewhere that's extremely

666
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:42,159
you know cold but generally you never

667
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,759
really want to have

668
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,320
uh your thousand watts being turned into

669
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,798
a lot of heat so efficacy is one thing

670
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,759
that we

671
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,359
put a lot of focus on we strive to have

672
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,519
the most efficacious light

673
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,399
you know is in basically every regard

674
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:55,839
you know in every

675
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,600
single grow craft fixture that we have

676
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:00,000
and recently

677
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,759
we actually launched the pre-orders for

678
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,839
grow craft ultra which

679
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,440
chris i know you've checked it out so we

680
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,639
have the the grow craft ultra

681
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,240
which is our ultra efficient fixture you

682
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,919
know it's it basically takes

683
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,079
the grow craft fixture which is already

684
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,799
great and takes things up a notch and

685
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,879
that's done

686
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,558
through uh you know how making sure we

687
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,679
have the highest quality components

688
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:23,038
possible

689
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,440
and having more diodes so we basically

690
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:28,079
you know

691
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:30,640
an x3 330 on the ultra has 4104 diodes

692
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,918
uh which is you know quite a few you

693
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,960
know if you you guys who have you know

694
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,880
kind of paid attention to great

695
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,480
technology that's kind of unheard of you

696
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,080
know to have a three bar light fixture

697
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,000
with only 330 watts

698
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,879
and so what that does is it basically

699
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,640
drives down the wattage per diode

700
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,720
and when you do that it actually

701
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,640
increases the efficacy of the diodes and

702
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,120
they run cooler and since we have these

703
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,880
over built heat sinks

704
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,719
you know they run even cooler and so

705
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,280
they they're they run very efficiently

706
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,000
and and uh you know what that leads to

707
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:59,678
is basically

708
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,519
minimizing the amount of input wattage

709
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,880
you need which

710
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:06,240
is great you know everyone wants to

711
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,919
reduce uh electric electrical use and so

712
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,359
basically we could compare it to is is

713
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,480
we have our

714
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:16,240
x3 500 watt standard grow craft and

715
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:20,319
we have an x3 330 ultra and that ultra

716
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:23,120
is producing similar total ppf

717
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:24,319
to the x3500 watt but obviously uses

718
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,079
less wattage

719
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,158
now the cost is higher because the cost

720
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,879
for us is a lot higher we are using the

721
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,440
absolute

722
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,240
highest possible bin and best diodes on

723
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,519
the market

724
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,120
and they're hard to get they're very

725
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:36,000
hard to get especially right now with

726
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,558
all the shortages

727
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,079
and so that caught that cost is the cost

728
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:42,000
that we have to have but

729
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,199
it's something that i think is worth it

730
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,960
because we're pushing

731
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,240
the industry forward and really showing

732
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,600
what is possible

733
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,839
right so the x3 330 ultra you know with

734
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,359
a

735
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:56,079
3.19 micro mo per joule efficacy is the

736
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:58,639
highest lab tested ever to date so far

737
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,240
and the standard you know grow craft

738
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,080
lights they're not far away from that

739
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,240
but this jump you know it takes a lot to

740
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,119
get to but really just shows what's

741
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,519
possible

742
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,399
and so having a high efficacy is very

743
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:10,400
important

744
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,519
and like i said we strive to have that

745
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,038
in all fixtures

746
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,720
and we even hit that record you know

747
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,000
with with the ultra but that doesn't

748
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,759
mean the standard grow craft has a low

749
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,359
efficacy it's still you know class

750
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,879
leading uh the x6

751
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:23,678
600 watt standard growth craft for

752
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,799
example at full power has a 2.81

753
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,840
micro mole per joule efficacy which

754
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:29,038
you know you can kind of look around at

755
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,359
other girl lights it's pretty high and

756
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,879
that's it's backed by lab test

757
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:34,639
which is another thing that's really

758
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,320
really big it's important to make sure

759
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,559
that the company you're buying from

760
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:39,599
has lab tests done on their fixtures so

761
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:41,038
that you know

762
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,399
that they're not just making these

763
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,319
numbers up you know like i said there's

764
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,679
a lot of misinformation in the industry

765
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:47,839
and a lot of manufacturers who aren't

766
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,880
afraid to lie and that's not something

767
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:51,038
that chill does

768
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,640
it's not something i would ever support

769
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,480
so

770
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,400
just make sure you pay attention to to

771
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,159
the efficacy and you make sure that your

772
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,919
fixture has a high efficacy that way

773
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,320
you're making the most of that wattage

774
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,000
so fxc measurement like you mentioned

775
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:05,599
micro moles per joule so when you're

776
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,240
looking at the grow light listing you'll

777
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,519
see

778
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:13,359
uml slash j for joule

779
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:14,639
um sometimes the the u is actually a

780
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,319
symbol it looks like a u but it's

781
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,000
actually a stands for micro it's a

782
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:18,720
symbol that stands for micro so micro

783
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,480
mole

784
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:25,440
per joule um here in 2021 i think

785
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,240
many can agree that anything under 2.0

786
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,519
micro moles

787
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,000
per joule is not efficient

788
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,759
we're way beyond that i think average

789
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,440
what i usually see 2.7

790
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:39,519
2.8 or even beyond that micro mold per

791
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,120
joule and some people consider efficacy

792
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,480
like the number one thing they look at

793
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,959
they look at that before they even look

794
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,120
at the par

795
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,798
numbers or again like i mentioned some

796
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,599
people look at par they prioritize par

797
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,158
over efficacy but there's neck and neck

798
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,359
there

799
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:56,640
as far as what to look for good

800
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,918
spectrum spectrum is another big thing

801
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,679
that people look at

802
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,840
you know you've got the spectrum chart

803
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,919
with all the colors going on there

804
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:04,879
talk to us about spectrum yeah spectrum

805
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,600
is very important

806
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,240
obviously you know right now we offer

807
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:10,959
under standard

808
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,440
craft two spectrums we have the flower

809
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,480
slash

810
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,080
full cycle spectrum or the veg spectrum

811
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,839
and now i have a lot of people that will

812
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,519
ask you know which one should i get

813
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:21,038
which one's for me i want to

814
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:22,639
you know i want to be able to go from

815
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,079
seed to harvest and that's

816
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,080
that would be the flower full cycle

817
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,720
spectrum and the reason for that is that

818
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:28,399
spectrum

819
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,558
from the white diodes alone there's

820
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,240
almost 20 percent blue spectrum already

821
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:35,678
and so it veggies really quite well and

822
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,960
but you also have that advantage of when

823
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,080
you hit flower you know you've got

824
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,600
plenty of red

825
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:43,038
you know basically it's it's a really

826
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:44,480
well balanced spectrum that's just

827
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:47,440
geared towards flower

828
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,240
and so uh it's been fine-tuned over many

829
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,120
years

830
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,038
chilled was started in 2016 and vitali

831
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:55,359
has been messing with leds our founder

832
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,440
for a long time and has basically found

833
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:58,240
out the best recipe for a single channel

834
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,640
light

835
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,038
that really does everything great and

836
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,759
you know performs very well in flower

837
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:07,038
so if you want to get the veg spectrum

838
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,158
that that spectrum has

839
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:12,000
more blue or uh i guess it focuses on

840
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,240
450 nanometer blue

841
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,079
and so you lose a little bit of you know

842
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,159
far red with the 660 nanometer

843
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,240
and it you know in exchange for more

844
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,080
blue which in vegetative growth

845
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,839
or if you have leafy greens like lettuce

846
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:26,558
and stuff like that um they prefer

847
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,119
more of a blue spectrum um to help you

848
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,599
know

849
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,519
overall lateral lateral growth uh you

850
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,879
know keep that inner nodal spacing very

851
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:35,440
tight

852
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,799
and basically you know just overall some

853
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,480
slight improvements when you go for a

854
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:41,440
veg spectrum for vegetative growth

855
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,240
but it's not required with those two

856
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,120
spectrums

857
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,079
we also are going to be releasing our

858
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,359
guardian system

859
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:52,558
which allows people to add spectrum bars

860
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:55,038
and those spectrum bars they add uv

861
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:57,359
infrared a little bit more deep red and

862
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:59,440
far red and more 415 or

863
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:01,918
450 nanometer blue and what that allows

864
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,400
you to do is to manipulate the spectrum

865
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,278
because first of all not all plant

866
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,440
genetics like

867
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,640
the exact same spectrum some of them

868
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,278
prefer

869
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,720
more blue spectrum or more red spectrum

870
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,440
for example if you have a very

871
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,159
tall plant that's just growing very

872
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,840
stretchy

873
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,679
what you can do is use more blue

874
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:20,639
spectrum to help kind of tighten it down

875
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,720
get those nodes

876
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,159
to grow a little tighter and not have

877
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,558
such a tall lanky plant

878
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,000
so that's not required but it's some

879
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:29,038
something that i think a lot of people

880
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,480
enjoy to play with

881
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:32,240
and really get to mess with the

882
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,960
morphology of a plant which

883
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,519
i think is fascinating i love that um

884
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,720
but again

885
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:40,639
not required the standard full cycle

886
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,079
flower spectrum has been fine-tuned for

887
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,679
seed to harvest growth

888
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,199
and most of our commercial growers

889
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,798
currently use that and

890
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,159
um you know as you've probably seen with

891
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:48,879
a lot of the pictures on our instagram

892
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,720
and stuff it's

893
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,000
got great results it's really really

894
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,600
kicking it out there

895
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,038
and i think a lot of people will be very

896
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:56,480
satisfied with that spectrum

897
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:58,319
man i don't have too much to add to that

898
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,440
you covered cover just about everything

899
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,879
here

900
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,798
but i do want to highlight the blue

901
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,559
spectrum for the vegetative stage

902
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,400
so blue light inhibits cell division

903
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:07,759
that's what caused the tighter node

904
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,360
spacing on the plants

905
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,599
a lot of people prefer that for

906
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:13,599
medicinal varieties for example

907
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:14,879
so they don't have these long stretchy

908
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,639
lengthy plants

909
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,159
so they'll have a higher blue spectrum

910
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,038
now typically

911
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,559
what i've been told is between 15 to 20

912
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:24,240
blue now unfortunately you're not going

913
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,918
to be able to look at

914
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,000
companies don't really advertise what

915
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,840
percentage uh

916
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,839
the different colors are unfortunately

917
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:32,158
right so and you can't just look at the

918
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,439
par

919
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:38,240
map i'm sorry the spectrum chart see

920
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,080
that there's a blue spike and you can't

921
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,038
tell what percent blue is no matter how

922
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:42,720
big the spike is

923
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,079
no matter how it looks you can probably

924
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,839
reach out to manufacturer

925
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,678
and maybe ask them what percentage of

926
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:48,158
blue is but i consider that definitely

927
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,240
one of the

928
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,600
more important things when talking about

929
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,038
spectrum for sure

930
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:54,639
yeah one other thing i want to add about

931
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,480
spectrum is

932
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,399
you will see a lot of companies without

933
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,120
naming names that will

934
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:03,278
add uv like a diode or two or add

935
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:06,398
infrared in a diode or two

936
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:07,759
and it's such a you know small amount

937
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,079
just so that they can say that their

938
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:10,480
spectrum includes it and i think there's

939
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,278
a lot of

940
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,519
a misconception where people think

941
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:18,000
adding uv or infrared makes a

942
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,679
massive difference even in small

943
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,960
quantities it really it really doesn't

944
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,640
make a big difference when you only have

945
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,558
a tiny little bit of it

946
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,480
and so when you see companies that add

947
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:28,240
just like one diode of uv

948
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,000
don't be fooled you know it's such a

949
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,599
small amount that's kind of even hard

950
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,480
to see on a spectrograph you know if

951
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:36,480
you're using a reader to test it

952
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,839
so make sure if you have uv included

953
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,240
that you look at the spectrograph you

954
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:39,439
know

955
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,200
and make sure that it's that you know

956
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,558
you can actually see it especially

957
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,720
especially if it's backed by

958
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,398
you know lab data um so don't be you

959
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,759
know don't worry too much about

960
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:49,918
you know having it just a diode or two

961
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,359
of uv that's you know doesn't make

962
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,600
as big of a difference as having the

963
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:54,959
proper spectrum overall

964
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,398
and there are going to be some people

965
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,240
out there like some lighting scientists

966
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,158
actually say that photons are photons

967
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,599
you know the spectrum is very little

968
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,840
importance of it so

969
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:05,599
you're going to hear a lot of different

970
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,558
things depending on who you talk about

971
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:09,119
there's

972
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,798
you know we could get in deeper on uv we

973
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,558
can get into green light we could get

974
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,398
into ir but

975
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:16,158
um that's really probably best suited

976
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:17,439
for a different video

977
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,960
right because we started talking about

978
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,960
plant growth and stuff like that this is

979
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,880
more of like a buyer's guide

980
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,558
on what you should look for on that

981
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,240
avenue but um

982
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:28,639
but yeah that spectrum is another thing

983
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,359
to look at another thing that i don't

984
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,960
see on many grow light listings anymore

985
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:33,759
i feel like i used to like four or five

986
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,480
years ago

987
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,759
is cri can you talk to us a little bit

988
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,278
about cri

989
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:44,319
yeah so cri is is the color

990
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:45,119
rendering index and that's basically how

991
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:47,200
accurately

992
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,639
a light source can represent natural

993
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,640
color um

994
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,759
now with that there's also uh you know

995
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,240
color temperature

996
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,119
so it can get a little confusing and

997
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,558
there's even been some

998
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,199
considerations of using a different

999
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:01,839
metric for leds because leds have

1000
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,120
have gotten so you know so accurate with

1001
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:05,439
color and stuff like that and there's

1002
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,558
such a wide range but one of the funny

1003
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,558
things is that

1004
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:09,839
growcraft actually has approximately a

1005
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:11,519
93 cri

1006
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:13,199
which 100 being uh you know it's

1007
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:14,879
perfectly represents what

1008
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,480
color or or something would look like

1009
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,440
under natural lighting

1010
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,880
and so uh with that you know as opposed

1011
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,720
to something like a blurple or some of

1012
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,200
the other lights uh

1013
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,798
your your plant is gonna look you're

1014
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,080
gonna be able to see things on it right

1015
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:29,038
it looks like it's just under the

1016
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:31,918
sunlight

1017
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:33,359
uh so you can really see you know what's

1018
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,960
going on on the leaves or you know if

1019
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,079
you have any weird growth maybe some

1020
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,000
some powdery mildew

1021
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:40,079
or anything like that that you know you

1022
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,720
want to be aware of right away

1023
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,599
so having a high cri kind of a side

1024
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,399
benefit

1025
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:47,599
that growcraft does have um as opposed

1026
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:49,199
to you know like a

1027
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:51,119
you could have compared to a bad example

1028
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,319
is or i guess a good example is a is a

1029
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:54,558
blurble light which

1030
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,079
uh if you've ever worked under a blurple

1031
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,558
light is not

1032
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:00,000
great it's not fun because it's first of

1033
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:00,720
all it's not very good for your eyes but

1034
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,558
you also

1035
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,079
you can't really see it and it has a low

1036
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:06,240
cri because

1037
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:08,319
we don't see the world in blur pole

1038
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,359
thankfully honestly cri isn't something

1039
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:10,879
i really even look at

1040
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:12,479
but uh but that's interesting that you

1041
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,919
say that yeah i didn't know that

1042
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,759
i think probably we don't see it as in

1043
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,440
many listings is because a lot of these

1044
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:18,640
lights are white light leds

1045
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,558
would you think that that would probably

1046
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,679
be the case why people don't

1047
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:25,278
mention cri as much anymore i think cri

1048
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,399
is just something that's more focused on

1049
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:28,480
for the photography

1050
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:29,918
industry right because you're it's more

1051
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,640
of a selling point for something like

1052
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,919
that where

1053
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,080
if you're working with you know any sort

1054
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,840
of color correction or

1055
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:38,158
you know making sure that things are

1056
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:39,199
represented appropriately

1057
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,799
you know it's that's something that's

1058
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,240
more for for like making a movie or

1059
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,759
taking pictures and stuff like that

1060
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,599
but it's it's a side benefit of a grow

1061
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:47,440
light right it's not something that's

1062
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,839
critical but you could also assume that

1063
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,919
if something has a high cri

1064
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,119
it probably is pretty accurate to what

1065
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,640
sunlight is

1066
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,398
you know what sunlight actually looks

1067
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,720
like and that's where plants

1068
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:59,599
grow right uh originally plants you know

1069
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,600
started growing

1070
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:02,639
outside and so having a high cri kind of

1071
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:05,359
indicates yeah you have

1072
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,960
a more white spectrum or uh accurate to

1073
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:09,918
this what sunlight is

1074
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,120
gotcha gotcha energy consumption let's

1075
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,080
talk about watts

1076
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:14,558
so 10 years ago it was all about watts

1077
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,599
right

1078
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:19,278
600 watts for a 4x4 thousand watts for a

1079
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,359
5x5

1080
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:22,960
and that was what people shopped by they

1081
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:24,319
shopped by watts that's not really the

1082
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,880
case anymore when we

1083
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,398
moved over to leds right so watts is a

1084
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,679
measurement of energy consumption you

1085
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:31,678
can take that number

1086
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,880
and you can actually use that and as

1087
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,480
long as you have

1088
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,600
a kilowatt per hour from your

1089
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,759
electricity company you can actually

1090
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:40,719
figure out what your electricity bill

1091
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:42,000
would be by doing a calculation there so

1092
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,679
that's mostly what people use

1093
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,519
watts for they don't really use it these

1094
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,320
days as an intensity

1095
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,359
factor i mean you mentioned the watts

1096
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:52,158
per square foot

1097
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:53,759
earlier but you know really watts is

1098
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,480
still being misused

1099
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,519
a lot these days um there's no longer

1100
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,319
you don't really need

1101
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,480
600 watts in a 4x4 anymore you can get

1102
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:03,038
away with 400 450 watts some of these

1103
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,278
grill lights

1104
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:06,558
and it depends on efficiency and it kind

1105
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:08,240
of goes back to the

1106
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:09,599
efficacy we talked about right how

1107
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,120
efficient is the grow light

1108
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,879
talk to us about watts what else do

1109
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:14,558
people need to know yeah absolutely like

1110
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,880
you said there's a lot of misconceptions

1111
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:18,158
on

1112
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,679
wattage and um you know how much wattage

1113
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,320
you really need just depends on that

1114
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,960
efficacy

1115
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:25,119
uh you know we still use or like our x6

1116
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,000
for example which is our best 4x4 light

1117
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,719
we offer it in a 600 watt four that we

1118
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,759
suggest for

1119
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,798
for flowering a 4x4 and

1120
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,720
i think that it's not required to have

1121
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:37,679
600 watts even with a high efficacy but

1122
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,519
it certainly helps

1123
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,360
you know having a high wattage with a

1124
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,720
high efficacy means you're really able

1125
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:44,639
to push the plants hard

1126
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,000
and back to kind of like supplementing

1127
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,440
co2 with our x6 600 watt in a 4x4

1128
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,359
you're you're probably going to want to

1129
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,320
have co2 to really get the most out of

1130
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:54,479
it or else you're going to end up

1131
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:56,079
probably having to dim your light

1132
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,519
without it but yeah you can stretch an

1133
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:01,599
x6 600 watt to a 5x5 with no problem

1134
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,359
that 600 watts these days it will cover

1135
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:05,278
it you know having a 2.81

1136
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,119
micro mole per joule efficacy really

1137
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:09,039
makes the most of each watt

1138
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:11,440
and back to the ultra it pushes that

1139
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:11,838
even further you could use our x3 330

1140
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,079
watt

1141
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:16,159
ultra which you know does come at a

1142
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,599
higher cost you could use that in a 4x4

1143
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,000
though and get great results

1144
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,079
and still have a good you know average

1145
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,440
ppfd across the canopy

1146
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,440
so yeah wattage has really changed but

1147
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,200
one thing to also consider is that all

1148
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,599
grow lights and their efficacy is not

1149
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,439
the same so you cannot compare

1150
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,119
the wattage you might find on this model

1151
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,280
to the wattage on this model you've got

1152
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,720
to pay attention to

1153
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,720
back to you know making sure you look at

1154
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,598
the wattage the efficacy

1155
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:45,759
the total ppf uh the total p the average

1156
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,879
ppfd across the grow space that you want

1157
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,079
to use it in

1158
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:49,838
basically you have to use all those

1159
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,440
factors to figure out which light will

1160
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,480
be best for you and the plants you're

1161
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,000
growing

1162
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,480
in this desired stage that you're

1163
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,559
growing at but yeah wattage is

1164
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,559
it's we're definitely seeing a decline

1165
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,799
in the need for a high input wattage

1166
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:04,559
but also at the same time increasing um

1167
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,560
total output you know as opposed to like

1168
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,159
a thousand watt hps

1169
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:09,920
which yeah you needed a thousand watts

1170
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,078
to cover a five by five

1171
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,838
um you know effectively but you know not

1172
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,960
anymore we're definitely bringing down

1173
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:17,279
that wattage so

1174
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,720
it's nice to see yeah and then like you

1175
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,160
had mentioned even if you're putting a

1176
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,159
600 watt one of the

1177
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,679
chilled 600 watts in a 4x4 you can

1178
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:24,159
always dim it down if you don't have

1179
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:26,399
that

1180
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:27,679
co2 supplementation that's features is

1181
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,519
another thing to look at right

1182
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:30,960
i highly recommend you get a dimmer on

1183
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:32,960
your grow light these days just because

1184
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,760
you have that flexibility

1185
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,800
to reduce the amount of energy you're

1186
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,640
consuming

1187
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,039
therefore reducing your electricity bill

1188
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,639
right you'll even be able to get the

1189
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,000
light closer to your plants if you're

1190
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:45,519
dimming it down

1191
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,920
so it helps when you talk about light

1192
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:49,280
distance so it just adds flexibility

1193
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,358
having a dimmer in there you know that's

1194
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,599
a feature to potentially look at

1195
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:55,039
detached driver is another thing right

1196
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,800
so some of these grow lights

1197
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,079
chilled grow lights you can actually put

1198
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,480
the driver which produces

1199
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,440
heat outside of your grow tent for

1200
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,119
example if you're hiding

1201
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,400
if you're having in the grow tent so

1202
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,680
that heat that's generated from the

1203
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,320
driver it's not going into your

1204
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,039
environment

1205
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,880
so you have that or you have fixtures so

1206
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,759
you know some companies will have the

1207
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,838
driver mounted to the actual fixture and

1208
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,760
again that produces heat increases heat

1209
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:19,838
so that's a potential feature to look at

1210
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,240
if a heat is a concern for you

1211
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:24,239
120 volt 240 volt like you know that's

1212
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:26,559
something else you got to look at

1213
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:27,838
what features do you think that

1214
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,239
consumers should be looking at these

1215
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:30,639
days

1216
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:32,399
definitely the dimmer like you said i i

1217
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,078
don't think i i would really

1218
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,838
even want to grow light without a dimmer

1219
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,560
just because uh maybe it's just because

1220
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:38,320
i'm so used to

1221
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:40,880
how nice it is having the the chilled

1222
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,160
grow craft lights with a dimmer because

1223
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,519
you never know what you're going to be

1224
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,960
growing you know truthfully you could be

1225
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:46,400
growing this one time and then

1226
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,599
next time you want to do this or you

1227
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,838
know your plants might need different

1228
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,280
intensities based on their genetics or

1229
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:52,559
uh you know you change your light your

1230
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,200
distance or you know your grow

1231
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:55,920
environment

1232
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:57,439
it's so nice to be able to uh you know

1233
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,280
change the dim your grow light i think

1234
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,760
that's extremely important and this

1235
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,200
isn't

1236
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,839
you know the meanwhile drivers that we

1237
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:06,159
use we use the 48b

1238
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:07,679
is the last you know serial numbers of

1239
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:09,279
the the meanwhile drivers we use and

1240
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:10,879
these have an external dimmer

1241
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,280
and we have a dimmer pot or

1242
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,400
potentiometer that has a very smooth

1243
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,160
5 to 100 percent intensity range and

1244
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,240
that way you can really you can use the

1245
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:21,358
light for really anything at any stage

1246
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,439
of growth

1247
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:24,880
or if you know if you need to for

1248
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,960
whatever reason you know kind of reduce

1249
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,960
your your heat temporarily

1250
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,720
you can kind of reduce reduce the the

1251
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,199
intensity while you you know let's say

1252
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:32,399
your ac

1253
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,799
broke or something like that you want to

1254
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,320
keep the light on its light schedule

1255
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,920
you can do that and reduce the dim get

1256
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,680
the heat down

1257
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,358
but yeah that kind of goes into another

1258
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:43,679
thing too uh

1259
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:45,598
is is basically having that that driver

1260
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:48,480
you can put the driver in the tent

1261
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,680
if you need let's say it's winter time

1262
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,240
and where you live it gets very very

1263
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:51,919
cold

1264
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,439
and you know with the reduced heat

1265
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,519
output of led

1266
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,559
versus hps that you could potentially be

1267
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:58,639
used to

1268
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,400
uh you know you may need that heat and

1269
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:02,078
so you can put the driver in the tent

1270
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,920
but yeah like you said you can remove it

1271
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,880
out we include with all of our grow

1272
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,200
craft fixtures

1273
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,240
both diy kit and the pre-built

1274
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:10,639
commercial

1275
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:11,759
a seven foot extension that goes from

1276
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,559
the driver

1277
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,560
to the fixture and then we also have six

1278
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,960
and a half feet from

1279
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:20,799
the wall plug to the fixture but you can

1280
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,920
also always come back to our site

1281
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,359
and get uh more of that extension cable

1282
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,639
now i don't typically suggest

1283
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,598
going over 21 feet from the driver to

1284
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,199
the fixture because then you

1285
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,880
have to start worrying about you know

1286
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:34,159
losing wattage

1287
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,640
and things like that so typically we

1288
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:37,279
suggest 21 feet which gives you plenty

1289
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:38,480
of room to

1290
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,720
you know mount around the wall outside

1291
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,920
of your room or put you know a lot of

1292
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,598
people just put it on top of the grow

1293
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,680
tent or just on the floor

1294
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,359
not really anywhere and you can remove

1295
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:48,559
that heat which is to me is an awesome

1296
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,078
feature that

1297
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,838
a lot of grow lights miss out on you

1298
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,400
know you'll see especially quantum

1299
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:55,199
boards

1300
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,639
you'll see they have the driver mounted

1301
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,639
to the fixture

1302
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,799
and so there's not really the ability to

1303
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:02,319
remove that heat but also

1304
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,320
not having the driver on top of the

1305
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,920
fixture reduces the heat

1306
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,800
of the grow light and like i mentioned

1307
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,039
before you know essentially a cool diode

1308
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,440
or

1309
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:13,199
chill diode is a happy diode and one

1310
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,159
that lasts longer but also can be more

1311
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:16,960
efficacious

1312
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:17,679
so yeah having that external removable

1313
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,838
driver

1314
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,598
it's excellent feature that i think a

1315
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:24,000
lot of other companies should have

1316
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,720
getting into drivers diodes the

1317
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,639
components

1318
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,159
of the fixture right that's a lot of

1319
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:31,039
people put a lot of emphasis

1320
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,879
on that you know diodes samsung we've

1321
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:34,719
got ozram cree

1322
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,559
bridge lux epistar there's just so many

1323
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:39,439
different dial brands out there

1324
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:40,480
drivers you got meanwhile eventronics

1325
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,800
sosan there's

1326
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,519
on and on and on give us some advice

1327
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,440
about what

1328
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:46,880
people should look for when it comes to

1329
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,800
looking at the diodes

1330
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,079
looking at the drivers the components of

1331
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,079
the fixture yeah

1332
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,920
so the diodes is obviously one that a

1333
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,280
lot of people pay attention to

1334
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,920
um but you know with chilled we don't

1335
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,720
publicly disclose the exact model number

1336
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,240
but i can tell you

1337
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:03,838
you know for the for the white chips we

1338
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:06,639
use top bin samsung's

1339
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,318
um basically the highest you can get and

1340
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,159
we don't disclose the reds but

1341
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:12,239
if you look at the numbers and the lab

1342
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:13,440
results it's very becomes very clear

1343
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:15,279
especially to someone who's experienced

1344
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,119
with grow lights that we must be using

1345
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,400
the best of the best and to achieve

1346
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,599
those numbers we have to be using the

1347
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,800
best

1348
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,400
but with you know with the diodes

1349
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,400
there's also the drivers so there's kind

1350
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,079
of two main manufacturers

1351
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,599
that you should look for there's

1352
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,280
meanwell which

1353
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,480
you know typically is the most efficient

1354
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,119
and then there's animatronics which is

1355
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,358
also

1356
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,160
a pretty efficient and good brand and

1357
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:36,480
then there's

1358
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:37,440
there's many other side brands with kind

1359
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,079
of no names

1360
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,760
which i can't speak on directly but

1361
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,880
don't always have the best reliability

1362
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,119
so i typically

1363
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,400
would suggest looking for a meanwhile or

1364
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,318
animatronics driver

1365
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,079
like i said we use meanwell we use one

1366
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:51,838
of their most efficient drivers

1367
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,280
and has that ex you know it's a little

1368
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:55,199
bit more expensive it has that external

1369
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,680
dimmer that we connect the dimmer pot to

1370
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:58,639
um for that really smooth uh dimming

1371
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:00,799
zero zero two

1372
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:02,239
or five to a hundred percent um also

1373
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,039
another thing that i wanna hit on

1374
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,000
is basically the overall build quality

1375
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:07,599
of the fixture

1376
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,199
this is something that surprises a lot

1377
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,160
of people when they first get their grow

1378
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:11,838
craft light

1379
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:13,199
they're absolutely blown away by the

1380
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:15,279
build quality and

1381
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:17,439
i think that it's something that we have

1382
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,480
an offer that a lot of companies don't

1383
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,440
is really having a really robust strong

1384
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,719
sturdy

1385
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,200
american-made good-looking structure

1386
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:27,838
and our u-frames are actually made

1387
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:29,838
locally

1388
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,279
in arlington just down the road from us

1389
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:32,400
and they're powder coated the other way

1390
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,640
down the road

1391
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,480
in arlington washington and they're such

1392
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:38,000
a high quality piece it's

1393
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,920
it's hard to see over pictures and

1394
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,400
videos just

1395
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,920
how sturdy and solid these things are

1396
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,559
and we have those really really nice

1397
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,079
over built

1398
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:50,078
aluminum heat sinks and yeah they just

1399
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,000
the build quality is often referred to

1400
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,200
as like an aerospace grade

1401
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,480
which i totally agree with you know

1402
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,318
actually i heard that from a from a

1403
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,318
customer one time and i'm like yeah

1404
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:00,079
that's that is true it does look like

1405
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:01,039
it's aircraft grade you know it's built

1406
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,880
really strong so

1407
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:05,039
you never have to worry about dropping

1408
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,079
this thing no i don't suggest dropping

1409
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,519
it but

1410
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,880
a while back uh you know later last year

1411
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:12,239
we released a video

1412
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,640
just kind of a funny spoof video where

1413
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,879
we dropped uh you know dropped a

1414
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:18,400
grovecraft light off of a ladder and

1415
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,680
truth be told that did happen we did it

1416
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,318
many times because there was multiple

1417
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:22,318
cuts

1418
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:24,239
and this thing was still fine no

1419
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:26,480
problems at all i don't suggest it

1420
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:27,759
again but it was totally fine and it's

1421
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,480
because of that really really strong

1422
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,680
structure

1423
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,838
that i think a lot of other companies

1424
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:33,118
miss out on you know they these are kind

1425
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:33,599
of some of the spots they'll cheap out

1426
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,160
on it

1427
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,519
is is uh just the build quality and so

1428
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,078
you don't you don't want to flimsy grow

1429
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:40,880
light

1430
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,240
you don't want that but also we we spent

1431
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,880
a little more time in research and

1432
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:44,639
development

1433
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,079
and it costs a little more but we've

1434
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:49,199
created a fixture that

1435
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,000
um has replaceable parts as well so

1436
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,480
basically

1437
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,679
you if let's say you had a pcb go bad or

1438
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,838
for whatever reason

1439
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,679
you actually hit it with something and

1440
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:59,759
you know broke broke a diode or whatever

1441
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:00,879
you can always pop in a new pcb we sell

1442
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,960
these on our site

1443
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,559
uh you know for very reasonable costs we

1444
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,000
even offer b grade which is just they're

1445
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,559
just slightly scratched no

1446
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,440
no physical damage or anything like that

1447
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:11,199
uh so

1448
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,559
that's another part of build quality i

1449
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:14,399
think that's very important is just

1450
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,239
having a very very sturdy light

1451
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,920
that's going to last you a long time

1452
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:19,838
uses you know like i said

1453
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,358
top bin samsungs and really just the

1454
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:22,318
best dials in the market having that

1455
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:24,480
good driver

1456
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:26,000
having the external dimmer all those

1457
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,880
kind of things i think are very

1458
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,800
important to look at yeah and and paying

1459
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,920
a little extra for that stuff i think is

1460
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,680
is worth it as well

1461
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,039
and kind of getting into the price

1462
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:37,598
prices can vary so much

1463
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:39,440
i mean we're looking at for a four foot

1464
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,519
by four foot coverage area

1465
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,880
lights ranging from seven hundred

1466
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:44,559
dollars all the way up to like

1467
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,160
fourteen hundred dollars for something

1468
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:47,519
like something even more than that

1469
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:49,679
for that particular coverage area so

1470
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,280
prices can range like crazy and that's

1471
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:54,000
gonna be one of the things that

1472
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,040
folks look at right is the price now one

1473
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,639
of the things that

1474
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:58,480
chilled does which i thought was pretty

1475
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:59,838
interesting on your website you list a

1476
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,440
couple measurements for price

1477
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:03,440
things that consumers can look at which

1478
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,760
is price per watt and price per micro

1479
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,960
mall

1480
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,040
can you talk to us a little bit about

1481
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,440
those two yeah yeah absolutely so

1482
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,039
the price per watt is one that i

1483
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,200
typically steer away from i know

1484
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,559
a lot of people especially some of the

1485
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:16,239
more old school people

1486
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:18,000
they really focus on that price per watt

1487
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:20,959
back to wattage being more important

1488
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,519
previously than it is now right and to

1489
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,039
me

1490
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:24,719
wattage is not what you should be

1491
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:25,920
focusing on because truthfully a

1492
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:28,159
high-end

1493
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,960
high efficient grow light doesn't need

1494
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:30,719
as much input

1495
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,199
wattage as a cheaper one and so you

1496
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:34,480
start looking at the dollar per watt

1497
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:36,078
and things can get a little weird

1498
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,480
because you're like well this this light

1499
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,079
shows that it outputs this much ppf

1500
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,000
but it has much lower wattage and so the

1501
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,880
dollar per watt you know is

1502
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,358
can be messed up so i prefer to look at

1503
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,680
uh

1504
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:48,559
you know dollar per per micromole which

1505
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:50,480
is something that

1506
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:51,759
that i think that we we do very well in

1507
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,400
and that's because

1508
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,800
having an eye high efficacy and you know

1509
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,200
uh

1510
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,400
having that respectable wattage number

1511
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:00,559
basically

1512
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,000
your your main focus is micro moles

1513
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:04,239
because that's what your plant is using

1514
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,280
it's using those photons right um

1515
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:07,759
to see you know what what the the total

1516
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,599
um

1517
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,040
you know light output is you basically

1518
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,119
that's what you're focused on is making

1519
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,679
sure your plant gets the light it needs

1520
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,480
at as cheap of a cost as possible that

1521
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:19,039
makes sense

1522
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,159
for sure now all that being said you

1523
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:21,440
know you've

1524
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:23,519
we've been through everything there

1525
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,079
right you've you look to buy coverage

1526
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:25,599
area

1527
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,359
for the light you make sure that the

1528
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,079
light distance is going to fix

1529
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:30,799
fit within your grow space par efficacy

1530
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,720
spectrum

1531
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,000
you're looking at all those things watts

1532
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:35,519
features

1533
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,760
you've narrowed down the price you found

1534
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:39,199
your fixture you buy the fixture and it

1535
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,480
jumps out within six months and you

1536
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:43,919
realize that the warranty

1537
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,199
only lasts five months so warranty is

1538
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,960
definitely something what i'm getting at

1539
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:49,039
is warranty yeah is another thing you

1540
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,880
should be looking at right so

1541
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:52,639
we'll wrap it up there as far as

1542
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,559
warranty some companies are

1543
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:56,480
just going to give you one year you've

1544
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:59,199
got one year if the fixture

1545
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,800
burns out on you after that it's on you

1546
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:02,960
some companies that do a three year

1547
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,000
but if some of the components burn out

1548
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,838
after a year

1549
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,358
you get to pay for the components you

1550
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:08,400
got to pay for shipping or something

1551
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:09,598
along those lines

1552
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,559
then you have some that have a full

1553
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,800
warranty so three years full warranty

1554
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:16,159
they'll do the fixture back and forth as

1555
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,280
far as shipping costs they'll pay for

1556
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:18,799
the components so some people have the

1557
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,440
five year warranty

1558
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,880
so there are many different warranties

1559
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,639
and it varies by

1560
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,000
led grille like company do you want to

1561
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:29,358
talk to us a little bit about

1562
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,719
warranty yeah warranty is a big one so

1563
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:34,880
on our diy kits our our cheaper fixtures

1564
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:36,480
you gotta assemble yourself

1565
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,640
they have a one year parts warranty

1566
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,240
which is kind of unheard of for a diy

1567
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:41,920
product to offer that because the

1568
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:43,039
assembly is in your hands we essentially

1569
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,960
give you parts

1570
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:46,079
kind of like legos and then are saying

1571
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,119
if you have any problem with parts

1572
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,480
within a year

1573
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,720
we will cover you know if you're in the

1574
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,318
states we'll cover shipping both ways

1575
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:53,759
and you know we'll pay for the return

1576
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:55,679
part and you'll be

1577
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,800
basically up and running typically with

1578
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:59,919
you know around a week

1579
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:03,200
we basically from the time you email in

1580
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,960
saying hey i had a bad pcb or or one of

1581
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:07,439
my diodes is out or anything like that

1582
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,960
or if you have a faulty meanwhile driver

1583
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,960
we basically will send you a new one

1584
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,920
within a day you know we're very very

1585
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,480
big on that

1586
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,079
because you know us all being growers

1587
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,519
ourselves we understand that

1588
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,519
the more time that your grow light is

1589
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,759
down um the worse it can be

1590
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,039
especially you know if you're any you

1591
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,000
know you're you're growing really any

1592
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:26,239
plan i guess but especially

1593
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,920
like a medicinal plant uh you know

1594
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:30,000
having that grow light go down

1595
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,680
could could cost you your your harvest

1596
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,719
which is not something you want to have

1597
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:33,519
you don't want to have a girl like go

1598
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:35,679
down

1599
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:37,199
you got to wait you know a long time for

1600
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:38,719
a warranty or you got to send the whole

1601
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:41,199
thing out

1602
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:42,799
and basically have it repaired you know

1603
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:44,879
we'll send you parts out right away

1604
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,720
so the commercial grow craft fixtures

1605
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,200
have a three-year warranty

1606
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:50,639
which allows you the ability if you have

1607
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,439
any problems with the light

1608
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:54,000
at all you can send the grow light back

1609
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,318
to us

1610
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,599
and we will fix it usually the

1611
00:47:56,318 --> 00:47:59,039
turnaround is pretty quick you know

1612
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,838
under a month for sure you can basically

1613
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:01,838
have a problem

1614
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:03,519
reach out to us send us the picture we

1615
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:05,759
fix it send it back

1616
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:06,960
but also we do again back to

1617
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,480
understanding that

1618
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,480
you know the longer your grill light is

1619
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,400
down the worse uh

1620
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,159
we allow you the ability to just have

1621
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,760
parts sent to you we are willing to send

1622
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:18,639
parts cover shipping again with your

1623
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,720
if you're within the states and you can

1624
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:21,519
basically just swap out the part and

1625
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:23,199
you're good to go

1626
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:25,119
the grow craft fixtures they're very

1627
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:26,799
easy to work on that's one thing that we

1628
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,838
really focused on was the modularity and

1629
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,079
the ability to

1630
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:32,000
just basically swap parts out quickly

1631
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,280
because again you just can't have your

1632
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,480
grill light go down that's not something

1633
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,160
anyone wants

1634
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,679
you can lose a whole harvest because of

1635
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:39,838
it so again

1636
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:41,440
three year warranty on the commercial

1637
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:42,480
fixtures one your parts warranty on the

1638
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,800
diy

1639
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,079
and again we don't there's no sort of

1640
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,359
fine print in that warranty

1641
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,920
where a lot of companies they'll offer a

1642
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:53,440
three year warranty but after the first

1643
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,240
year you have to cover

1644
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,079
shipping most of the time both ways or

1645
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:00,318
you have to start covering

1646
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,519
the labor cost to fix it after two years

1647
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:03,199
we don't do any of that

1648
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:04,880
if you have a problem and it's you know

1649
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:06,558
it's been two years

1650
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,318
we treat you as if you just got the

1651
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,760
fixture you know we don't we don't play

1652
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:11,838
any games with you on the warranty

1653
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,960
and again we're very quick about it we

1654
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:15,279
are we have

1655
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,400
one main location and it's in arlington

1656
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,800

and we basically just try to provide the

1672
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,440
best experience we can possibly when it

1673
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,119
comes to warranty because

1674
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,720
no one likes warranty claims no matter

1675
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,119
what the product is it's not fun

1676
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:54,078
to have a problem and we make sure we

1677
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,800
make that as easy

1678
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,680
and as quick as possible yeah warranty i

1679
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,800
mean definitely

1680
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:00,558
definitely look at that so you don't get

1681
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,318
screwed that's for sure but yeah we

1682
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,960
covered a lot so you know

1683
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:05,759
i uh before we when i got this idea for

1684
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,519
the video

1685
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,960
and when i contact you i'm like man this

1686
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:10,000
is gonna be a good video where things

1687
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,920
are gonna be explained so

1688
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,679
easily and people are going to get it

1689
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,119
it's going to be all smooth

1690
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:18,078
looking back what we just recorded

1691
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,599
there's a lot of things to consider

1692
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,119
when purchasing a grow light and there

1693
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,440
are people that are going to leave this

1694
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,720
conversation still confused and still

1695
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,400
not know which way to go

1696
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:27,598
definitely it's hard it's hard and

1697
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,480
sometimes i feel like i'm bad at

1698
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,720
explaining but

1699
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,159
um i always just try to suggest people

1700
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:33,439
to just reach out to me you know i love

1701
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:34,879
talking about it and i'll

1702
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,639
as you can see i'll just keep talking

1703
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,079
and talking and talking

1704
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:39,519
but it's because i just genuinely enjoy

1705
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,800
it and i think there's so much

1706
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:43,280
misinformation

1707
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,559
and people are misled so often and i

1708
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,000
really just want to help even if you

1709
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,240
at the end of our conversation you don't

1710
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,838
end up buying our light that's fine with

1711
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:50,799
me i feel like i've helped you know i've

1712
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,078
done my part

1713
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,079
and that's kind of our whole mission

1714
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:57,519
with chilled is to not

1715
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,880
just just sell lights and turn a profit

you know i don't want anyone to feel

1723
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,240
intimidated with growing because there's

1724
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:14,239

ocean grown discord and uh we hope to

1749
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:57,118
expand even further

1750
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:58,400
as time goes on and uh you know i don't

1751
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,680
have to wear so many hats you know

1752
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,599
because right now

1753
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:03,279
my focus is kind of all over the place

1754
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,240
and uh i try to be as many places as

1755
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,480
possible but hopefully

1756
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:08,159
that'll expand even further some of the

1757
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,559
things that we have coming up

1758
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:12,558
if you guys haven't seen already we have

1759
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,160
our guardian system coming out

1760
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:15,599
and that system includes you know a

1761
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:17,920
touchscreen

1762
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,200
controller spectrum bars which add you

1763
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:23,119
know uv infrared

1764
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:24,480
deep red far red more blue and then

1765
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,519
all these sensors that we're going to be

1766
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,039
having we're you know we're going to

1767
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:29,199
have co2 sensors

1768
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:31,199
power sensors all sorts of sensors to

1769
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:32,000
basically automate as much as you can

1770
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:34,000
with your grow

1771
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,358
and monitor things and and be able to

1772
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,519
data log

1773
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:39,119
um and then with that we also have our

1774
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:40,400
ultra our chil

1775
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,318
grow craft ultra fixtures that are

1776
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,800
coming out and those again those are

1777
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:44,719
kind of a

1778
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,000
more of a limited run there you could

1779
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:48,000
view them as kind of our

1780
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,039
super car if you would um so if you want

1781
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,159
one of those definitely hop in and

1782
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:51,440
pre-order one

1783
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:53,440
um but those will be coming in the

1784
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,039
future but we

1785
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,559
we plan to stick with the current grow

1786
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:59,119
craft design for a while we

1787
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:00,800
you know may expand here and there but

1788
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,400
mostly our focus is to keep building

1789
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,280
upon what is already great and already

1790
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,800
there

1791
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,280
as opposed to replacing it because you

1792
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,960
know what's there is truly great

1793
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,800
and this guardian system and stuff like

1794
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,159
that will really just help

1795
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,680
elevate it so if you want spectrum

1796
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:14,719
control or you're interested in any of

1797
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:16,399
that

1798
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:17,679
definitely head to our youtube channel

1799
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,200
and you know check out some of our

1800
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:20,639
explanation videos

1801
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:22,879
but also we're gonna have a lot more

1802
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:23,279
content on that soon and hopefully you

1803
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,358
know

1804
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,960
i could potentially come back on the

1805
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:28,078
show when it's all done

1806
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,079
and fully released and not just

1807
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,440
pre-order and kind of maybe show you

1808
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:33,280
or talk to you about it and maybe

1809
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,800
someday you know we could potentially

1810
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,519
hook you up with a system

1811
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,400
yeah absolutely that'd be cool so lots

1812
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:40,719
of good stuff there

1813
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,079
