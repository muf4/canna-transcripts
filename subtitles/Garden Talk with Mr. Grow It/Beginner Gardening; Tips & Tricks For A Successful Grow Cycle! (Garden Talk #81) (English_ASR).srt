1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,839
coming up on garden talk thing you want

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,440
to do as new growers you want to

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,519
eliminate as many

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,839
places that you can go wrong as possible

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,839
you know take those variables out don't

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:12,718
work hard to throw things in that can go

7
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:14,400
wrong

8
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:15,518
we just think more is better you know

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,199
more light

10
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,439
you know more nutrients more water

11
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,840
that's going to give me more plant

12
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,000
and until you realize that's really not

13
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,439
the truth just took it and split it

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,518
right down the middle

15
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,679
and we duct taped it all up put a

16
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,678
tobacco cage around it and that plant

17
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:34,079
was the biggest yielding plant that we

18
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,359
ever had whatever it was it just kicked

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,399
it into like

20
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:41,600
some kind of super mode don't chase us a

21
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,600
vpd number a ph number your plants will

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,480
tell you what you need to do more is not

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,840
better

24
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,479
you know sometimes the more you do the

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,480
less you get

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,799
what's up everybody if you that don't

the side of my grow tent and it has 10

00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,878
control air circulation they do also

71
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,040
have non-oscillating versions of these

72
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,878
clip-on fans these fans are currently in

73
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,439
high demand when they sell out of the

74
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,598

thanks to ventana plant science for

83
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,039
sponsoring this episode i started using

84
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,039
the bottle flavor in my garden flavor

85
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,959
can be added to any nutrient lineup

86
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,000
studies have shown an increased yield of

87
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,719
14

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,280
and also increased terpenes from 1.1 to

89
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,680
2.4 percent flavor is an all-natural

90
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,199
polymer that holds nutrients in solution

91
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,680
it also prevents precipitants of

92
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,318
nutrients and increases nutrient uptake

93
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,599
flava is available on

94
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:21,439

105
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,479
tips for beginner gardeners so there are

106
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,158
so many people out there who are

107
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,399
starting their first garden especially

108
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,079
as legalization sweeps across the world

109
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,000
here so in this episode i want to go

110
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,080
back to the basics i'm not trying to

111
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,680
scare off any intermediate or advanced

112
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,280
growers because i'm sure there's gonna

113
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,360
be some takeaways for you even if it's

114
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,360
just a reminder to to keep it simple but

115
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,640
first let's do an introduction can you

116
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,840
tell us a little bit about yourself and

117
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:08,079
how you got into gardening well um i i

118
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,640
mean i look at but i'm 55 years old i

119
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,640
have three grandchildren

120
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,559
i rescue animals i

121
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,759
i got a couple parrots some cats and a

122
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,000
dog

123
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,918
um my first introduction to growing

124
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
medicinal plants came when i started

125
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,959
helping neighbor with an outdoor

126
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,959
grow

127
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,478
i was pretty much just a helper you know

128
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,959
and especially at the end when you had

129
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,879
to do all the trimming uh but then i met

130
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,120
a girl and we bought a house and we

131
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,120
moved away and it's a

132
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,120
upscale neighborhood you can't really be

133
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,959
doing that out in the backyard you know

134
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,560
where i live now and plus there's a lot

135
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,159
you know it's a big open area there's a

136
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,240
lot of traffic and

137
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,600
it's you know it wasn't possible plus we

138
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,000
you know we just bought a house we

139
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,479
didn't want to take any chances and then

140
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,160
all of a sudden legalization just

141
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:54,800
ma'am it was here

142
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,560
um i had a long talk with the girlfriend

143
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,800
to try to get her out i just said it'll

144
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,519
just be a small little thing and

145
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,400
don't worry about it it'll be okay and

146
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:07,439

and then i i was lucky i

169
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,000
the folks from i hooked up with the

170
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,079
folks from mile gm

171
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,600
and they you know they took an interest

172
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,318
in my channel they helped me get over

173
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,919
that you know a thousand sub hump

174
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,160
you know with a couple you know

175
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,079
giveaways and things and

176
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,080
you know and that led to spider farmer

177
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,839
so i you know they've been really good

178
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,318
to me and that you know that having a

179
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,239
channel really helps in that way

180
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,160
um you know you're you're kind of doing

181
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,918
a favor for a company by you know

182
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,000
showing your product and in return

183
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,399
you're getting product you know so

184
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,199
that's a good as long as you find decent

185
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,359
you know

186
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,000
companies to work for in your

187
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,080
you know it's it works out good

188
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,918
yeah absolutely and as always i'll

189
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,000
definitely have a link to chronic crow's

190
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,198
channel down in the youtube description

191
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,879
section below and if you're on one of

192
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,439
the podcast platforms just search for it

193
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,680
you'll find them so what's your overall

194
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,319
style of gardening i mean are you

195
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,199
indoors mostly do due to any outdoors

196
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,240
organic synthetic what's your style

197
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,038
um i'm indoor and soil um i use

198
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,759
synthetic nutrients i i did try the fox

199
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:01,038
farm dirty dozen

200
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,360
grill ago

201
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,120
it's a little more i guess it's a little

202
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,879
more organic but it was just so many

203
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,160
bottles and

204
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,839
it was really hard for me to really

205
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,360
understand when i was

206
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,318
i was feeding

207
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,560
at times and uh so i went you know kind

208
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,720
of went back on on that went back to the

209
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,680
general hydroponics that he started with

210
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,400
it's just so much easier you know what's

211
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,720
going in there it's it's simple

212
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,399
it's really hard to turn to hard to mess

213
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,520
it up

214
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:33,120
um yeah and then are you mostly doing

215
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,639
are you doing autoflowers or photo

216
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,160
periods or what

217
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,038
no no i did when i my uh i'll tell you

218
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
the

219
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:42,318
how

220
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,319
i learned to keep it simple it was my

221
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,160
first grow you know i went on youtube

222
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,240
i'm watching all these videos and you

223
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,639
know some of the choices i made i i

224
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,439
started off with dwc

225
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,800
i had autoflowers and photo periods in

226
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,319
the same time

227
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,199
and i had hps lighting in a top over

228
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,919
over the over the buckets so as you can

229
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,560
imagine it was a struggle i was like oh

230
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:09,198
my my water's getting too hot and i had

231
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,079
to do you know i had to wrap the buckets

232
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,240
and

233
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,918
and and covering so you know keep the

234
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,120
temperature down and

235
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,680
um

236
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,639
i was you had to monitor the ph all the

237
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,959
time

238
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,960
and then the plants they grew so fast

239
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,680
that at the end i ended up having to

240
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,918
switch my hood because they just grew

241
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,840
right up into the hood to the top of the

242
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,680
four by four time even though i had to

243
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,240
put it all the way as high as we go it

244
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,440
was just hanging by the little clips

245
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,038
um i finished you know it you know i got

246
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,279
quite a lot of

247
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,559
a lot of product out of it but you know

248
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,320
the the

249
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,479
the light only penetrates so far so

250
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,680
anything below that you know it's it's

251
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,399
pretty much

252
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,838
you know you know edible quality

253
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,679
stuff there's really you know it's just

254
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,560
larvae

255
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:58,799
i i just expected it to be better having

256
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,159
seen what it looks like outdoors it just

257
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,079
that it just

258
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,360
you know i i knew i bit off more than i

259
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,959
can chew

260
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,800
so like okay i gotta get back to the

261
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,919
basics you know i gotta figure out what

262
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,519
i want you know i wanted perpetual right

263
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,759
from the beginning i knew that you know

264
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,360
i started small one tap but my goal was

265
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,200
okay if this works out

266
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,879
then i'm gonna go and get another tap

267
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,240
for veg and i'm gonna you know try to

268
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:21,919
keep this at least get a two light

269
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,600
rotation going

270
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,838
and uh

271
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,399
then uh

272
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,680
you know i i started learning you know

273
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,720
about

274
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,319
over watering um too much light to too

275
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,720
many nutrients

276
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,519
and uh once i

277
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,360
i

278
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,480
learned that i didn't really have to

279
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,480
have to do that much with soil soil

280
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,120
seemed like the way to go

281
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,200
you know i i was just so the the very

282
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,480
first one with the dwc just took up so

283
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,240
much of my time

284
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,320
you know i was down there you have to

285
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,200
check you know that ph is so important

286
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,519
when you're in those that kind of system

287
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,920
on soil it's not so important and you've

288
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,959
got a you got a lot wider range you know

289
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,319
that you can play with uh

290
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,399
and uh

291
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,720
now you know it's expanded and you know

292
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,600
i got a three light rotation going

293
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,120
so it's every eight or ten weeks i'm

294
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,120
harvesting the time

295
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,720
yeah the dwc i mean you mentioned though

296
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,320
the water temperature being high and

297
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,920
that because that's a concern for me

298
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,200
because i live in the desert and it's

299
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:28,319
like i think it's 113 degrees out today

300
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,640
outside and like inside here my ac is on

301
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,560
the entire time and it's just under

302
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,720
it's like 79 degrees fahrenheit right

303
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,119
now and the water temperature if i were

304
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,560
to run a dwc system i'd be struggling

305
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,480
just like just like you mentioned

306
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,078
because you need to keep the temps at a

307
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,519
certain degrees it's gonna need to be

308
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,519
below a certain degrees or else you can

309
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,159
come across problems so

310
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,000
yeah i can imagine uh why why you're

311
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,000
going towards the soil and how it's more

312
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,799
a little bit more forgiving than a dwc

313
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,480
system now are you still with hps you

314
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,319
mentioned you had that or did you switch

315
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,720
over to led like what are you using for

316
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,399
lighting right now well right now i'm in

317
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,320
flower i'm flowering with the spider

318
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,839
farmer sf4000

319
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,040
in the 4x4

320
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,920
i had

321
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,199
this would be my second flower with the

322
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,078
led

323
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,920
um

324
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,000
i mean the hps was doing just great i

325
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,559
could have continued with that and i may

326
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,399
if if i struggle again i i had a little

327
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,278
bit of an issue with temperature in the

328
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,399
in the

329
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,919
winter

330
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,799
you know i am from uh the northeast so

331
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:31,278
even though i get heat it i i get heat

332
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,719
and ac from the house it's still always

333
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,480
a little bit

334
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,800
a little bit off than what it actually

335
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,240
is in the house so i you know now i've

336
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,519
added a little bit of i just have a

337
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,039
little oil

338
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,039
heater in there

339
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,199
you know i set that to like 72 and then

340
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,319
it never it really gets below that down

341
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,120
there

342
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,399
um so i'm you know i'm real lucky with

343
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,240
that

344
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,839
but i you know a lot of people would say

345
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,120
i grow pretty pretty

346
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,839
cool you know i i

347
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,360
never get above 80 degrees on the time

348
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,959
you know that's pretty rare that's

349
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,639
that's a real hot day

350
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,919
that must be nice

351
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,600
for me it's a struggle i'm always

352
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,439
running an ac in order to try to keep

353
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,560
things cool but you know when it comes

354
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,800
to lighting i want to dig a little bit

355
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:13,838
deeper into that because this there's so

356
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,919
much

357
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,240
when it comes to lighting i mean it's so

358
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,479
easy to look at lighting you know if

359
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,120
you're shopping for lighting seeing all

360
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,320
these different technical specifications

361
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,560
and get overwhelmed right so do you have

362
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,079
any general advice for like beginners

363
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,159
maybe that they're shopping for a light

364
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,879
or even using light tips for using

365
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:37,039
lights well light light's important you

366
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,320
know if you're going to veg lights a

367
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:40,000
little less you know the kind of light

368
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,920
you veg with is a little less important

369
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,480
than the kind of light you flower with i

370
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,958
mean your your yield is your yield is

371
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,480
based on your light your wattage of your

372
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,159
you know the amount of power that your

373
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,600
light is putting out

374
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,919
um

375
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,440
and you know your quality is is really

376
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,679
the grower talent you know the

377
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,440
healthiness of your plant when you when

378
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,399
you flower it

379
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,959
uh

380
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,480
all the different lights worked um

381
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:08,239
you know i've seen people

382
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,600
grow under cfls uh you know t flower

383
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,278
under t5s

384
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,519
you can flower under

385
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,759
any of the systems work it really

386
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,320
um it's what you can really if it's what

387
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,078
you can afford and you know that there's

388
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,920
nothing wrong with starting small and

389
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,519
then you know as you

390
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,159
you know it's kind of what i did i just

391
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,759
started i started smalling the hps an hp

392
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:32,319
system 600 watt hps systems it's nothing

393
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:35,200
you know with a dimmable ballast

394
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,320
and you get two bulbs the ballast uh

395
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,560
a hood

396
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,720
you know and it's it's pretty cheap and

397
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:43,198
you know you have the wattage you know

398
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,399
the 600 watts and the 4x4 is kind of

399
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,679
really what you

400
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,240
what you want

401
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,559
you know to really to flower out a plant

402
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,278
and you know and get some yield

403
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:56,159
um ice i use t5s

404
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,399
in veg i just like the way and i try to

405
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,639
do a little led and veg and

406
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,639
you know

407
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,040
i just i like the way the the t5s work

408
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:08,399
i mean i i start with very little light

409
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,679
i sprout with a

410
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,320
two foot

411
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,599
um t5 and i just put it right on top of

412
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,839
the dome

413
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,800
you know that's good for two three weeks

414
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,480
you know that will sprout 50 seedlings i

415
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,719
mean if you you could fill all those

416
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,120
plugs and sprout with that one light and

417
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,240
the light will take care of them for two

418
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,799
weeks

419
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,720
um then you know obviously you've gotta

420
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:32,319
you pull them out and put them in party

421
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,000
cups they're a little more spaced apart

422
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,240
you need a little bit more

423
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,399
i have a tube well

424
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,919
t5 you know i have one of those little

425
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,039
divided up tents you know it's got the

426
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,799
little shelf

427
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,599
i got so i have my little steeling drum

428
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,759
up top down below i've got a little two

429
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,720
two bulb one and if i'm only sprouting a

430
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,159
few

431
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,920
you know i can put them under that and

432
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,319
then i have a four bulb one that fills

433
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,519
up kind of like the three by three space

434
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,120
and then when they get a little bigger

435
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,839
in the solo cup so i can keep them all

436
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,519
in there you know it's all on that 24

437
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,959
hour light cycle

438
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,879
so you know

439
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,479
that all works out great

440
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:10,320
then i move them

441
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,199
to uh two by four that's got four um

442
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,519
four foot t5 bulbs in it

443
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,919
and that's where i grow them you know i

444
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,759
try to fill that two by four out get a

445
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:22,078
full canopy in that

446
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,919
once that two by four is full it halfway

447
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,000
fills my four by four

448
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,159
and then when i flip the flower the

449
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
stretch you know they'll grow they'll

450
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,879
grow twice as big

451
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,639
and then mine i've got a full canopy

452
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:40,000
and it really kind of you know i i

453
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:43,519
i i really try to um stuff the lighting

454
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,440
up it's a very slow incremental process

455
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,198
um you know when they're when they're

456
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,279
little and they're young

457
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,958
they want they don't need a lot of light

458
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:52,159
and and they just need a little bit of

459
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,000
light in that little bit of light as

460
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,759
well if you're trying to grow roots you

461
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,759
know you're not trying to grow

462
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,680
vegetation you know in that early

463
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,278
seedling stage you're trying to get the

464
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:03,838
roots to grow and that just a little bit

465
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,838
of light is is all they need

466
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,399
and it's cheap and it saves you a lot of

467
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,800
money too you know you're not you're not

468
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,360
blasting it with a you know more light

469
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,639
than it needs um they respond a lot

470
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,039
better

471
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,959
uh i just you know i i

472
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,639
you know i strongly believe that you

473
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,198
know light is like kind of like shifting

474
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,278
gears in the car you know it's got to be

475
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,039
you kind of work and if you hit it at

476
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,879
the end where oh you know that last

477
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,958
couple weeks you're at 100 percent in

478
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,399
your flower top you know you know you

479
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,838
did it right

480
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,198
and you're getting the mac and then your

481
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,800
your plants are getting the maximum

482
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,319
amount of watts the maximum amount of

483
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,679
light at the end when they really need

484
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,199
it when they're

485
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,159
when they're you know they're finishing

486
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,639
off

487
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,480
and and can use that gas

488
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,079
yeah and i just want to repeat what you

489
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,560
had said towards the beginning there is

490
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,838
the the light that you could use a lot

491
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,679
of people get caught up to like oh you

492
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:58,000
need 3 000 k for flower and 4 000 k for

493
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,399
vegetation stage and that's just not

494
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,440
entirely true you can literally grow the

495
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,679
plant

496
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,038
from seed to harvest with the same

497
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,480
spectrum so i think a lot of people

498
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:07,759
there unfortunately are beginners out

499
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,599
there they're spending money on two

500
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:12,078
different grow lights in order to have

501
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,519
them for the different stages and it's a

502
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,279
little bit of an overkill they're just

503
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,480
they're just unknowingly going on

504
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,480
spending money when they don't really

505
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,199
need to so i'm glad you actually

506
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,000
mentioned that part because uh yeah

507
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,679
that's a common misconception sure about

508
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,798
lighting absolutely

509
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,960
right

510
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:32,798
yeah you know spectrum is really little

511
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,798
to do with it i mean and if

512
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,280
is

513
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,120
so small i don't think it's really that

514
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,279
noticeable i know people usually you

515
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,879
know can the light companies will argue

516
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:43,839
differently that you know but it's kind

517
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,360
of like they're kind of like the

518
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,839
nutrient companies you know they say

519
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,319
well my light gives you 20 more you use

520
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,319
mine you know it's the it's the same

521
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,240
sales technique tons of marketing

522
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,038
getting shoved down your throat yep it's

523
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,960
it's

524
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:58,879
every light company has the best light

525
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,558
when you talk to him so

526
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,039
it's it's crazy

527
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,720
you mentioned too much light being an

528
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,079
issue for a lot of new growers can you

529
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,120
get deeper into that like how do new

530
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,199
growers

531
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,719
know when they're giving too much light

532
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,400
and how do they like

533
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,640
i guess adjust their light to fix the

534
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,720
issue you'll find that as we go through

535
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,960
this thing that the too much thing will

536
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,038
pop up pop up a lot

537
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,640
um i think it's a guy thing you know

538
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,558
that's probably why girls grow better

539
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,480
than we do you know we just think more

540
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,240
is better you know more light

541
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,400
you know more nutrients more water

542
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,759
that's going to give me more plant

543
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,919
and um

544
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,319
until you realize that's really not the

545
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,880
truth and you know you

546
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:40,720
you step away from some of that and you

547
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,280
give it really what it needs and you

548
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,279
know nothing nothing more

549
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,839
then you know with light

550
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:50,879
they respond better it's it's

551
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:54,079
you know you use you can stunt them

552
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,640
real easy with too much light and it

553
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,439
causes you know you you just burn them

554
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,759
up

555
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,519
and you know i've seen people with you

556
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,759
know they end up with a beautiful canopy

557
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:06,558
full of buds but it's right up in the

558
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,480
light you know and it's just getting

559
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,038
they're just getting cooked by you know

560
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,440
just too much light because it got too

561
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:16,160
close i mean there needs to be

562
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,679
um like with my led my my spider farm i

563
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,360
put all the way to the top of the top

564
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,038
like that's where i start

565
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,199
even though my canopy is so low down

566
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,599
there i just use the knob

567
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,960
to to you know dial it up you know i

568
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,639
give them a little bit of adjustment

569
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,038
phase and i kind of okay maybe that's a

570
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,038
little much or back it off a little bit

571
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,759
and then from then it's just like every

572
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,038
week when i water i might turn it up a

573
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,079
little bit and

574
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:42,079
kind of ease it up that way and it

575
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,918
you know it works out fine

576
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,240
when i first grow you know somebody had

577
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,840
i was online it's like no you need to be

578
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,919
hitting your plant with

579
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,918
that's a full 600 watts right now what

580
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,360
are you doing you know and i'm like oh

581
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,520
crap you know i better get down there

582
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,759
and turn that bail stuff you know and

583
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,759
then you know i'm blasting it with 600

584
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:01,679
watts you know when they they still

585
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,679
should have been way down you know and i

586
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,840
had nowhere to go there was no

587
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,720
you know i was totally out of gas out of

588
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:10,240
room

589
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,960
to to to bring it up anymore or ease it

590
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,720
up

591
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,480
i have a buddy who he has four solo cups

592
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,679
he's got four seedlings going in a four

593
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,839
by four tent

594
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,360
he's got two spider farmer sf 2000s

595
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,599
both of them going at the same time and

596
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,439
unless like like i told them before too

597
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,839
as lasker i told him like dude you could

598
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,240
like just use one of those lights and

599
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:34,158
like lower it and dim it down and he's

600
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,000
not doing that he's just yeah all the

601
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,720
way to the top at like five percent

602
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,960
would be plenty yeah yeah it's just it's

603
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,038
tough you know especially the seedlings

604
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,038
you know i've i've

605
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,079
i've i've had a

606
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:48,400
um

607
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:50,000
pop quite a few means you know i i'm

608
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,960
pretty picky with seedlings you know

609
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,919
pretty early on you know for plants

610
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,679
you know it's it's genetics it's or what

611
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,720
you're looking for you know i'm looking

612
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,480
for

613
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,400
you know branches because that's where

614
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,960
the buds grow you know

615
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,120
branches and nodes if if they're getting

616
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,960
stretchy and i'm not seeing that no

617
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,279
development or they're falling behind

618
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,200
the other seedlings it's

619
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,279
literally off the cliff i have one in my

620
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,640
backyard with a cook

621
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,158
and they

622
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,759
they take the little ride down to the

623
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,679
river

624
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,759
you mentioned you're in soil

625
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,200
and you mentioned you started with fox

626
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,200
farm nutrients then you moved over to

627
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,400
general hydroponics let's get deeper

628
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,720
into nutrients because that's another

629
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,480
area where folks get caught up a lot

630
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,720
especially the new beginners right talk

631
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,558
to us about you know how do you go about

632
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,400
feeding and what tips do you have for

633
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:42,798
beginners in regards to feeding well um

634
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,640
current like i said i use a three part i

635
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:48,879
have r or water so i have to use calmac

636
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,880
a little bit more than you normally see

637
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,280
in the feed schedule

638
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,000
i use rapid start

639
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:58,798
in the beginning and during veg

640
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,759
floralicious plus and liquid cool bloom

641
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:04,400
and uh of course great white

642
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,240
um and that's kind of the stuff i use in

643
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,720
veg and flower

644
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,880
seedlings and baby plants i use you know

645
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,919
clonex solution you know the first four

646
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,880
weeks of their life they're getting

647
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,400
clonex solution and and great white

648
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,280
every other week

649
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,600
um

650
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:23,119
the i'm pretty new to mother plants but

651
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:27,199
i i i decided to stick with the same

652
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:29,359
um clonex clonex brand and i'm using the

653
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,200
mother plant a and b for

654
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,719
the mother plant going forward and i

655
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,640
ended up with a

656
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,558
really really nice

657
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,320
granddaddy purple

658
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:42,960
that i'm gonna be using the clone with

659
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,399
and i'm going to use uh orca ponex

660
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,640
solution and

661
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,919
in the cloner

662
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,640
um

663
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,480
again i i one thing i have today you

664
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,280
know this might

665
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,759
make people's jaws drop a little bit

666
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:02,000
but as far as npk goes i only feed once

667
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,960
in veg and

668
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,759
at the most twice in flower

669
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,600
um

670
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:11,038
that's because i keep my you know

671
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,439
i don't want my plants get bigger than

672
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:15,119
the container that they're in um i try

673
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,159
to you know oh

674
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:20,839
and you kind of get a feel for how long

675
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:24,480
the soil's got a couple weeks

676
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:26,240
um or how long it's you need to feed it

677
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,079
and if you're if they're growing along

678
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,480
in a good place and you're transplanting

679
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:33,199
it with right stages you don't really

680
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,798
need there's a lot in the soil um

681
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,400
i'm not saying that you know i do give

682
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:37,519
them like the supplements and the

683
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,440
additives

684
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,359
you know as i water them

685
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,720
but i mean as far as really feeding them

686
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,240
unless i'm seeing some kind of

687
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,880
deficiency

688
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,359
you know nitrogen you know or something

689
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,640
like that i'm you know i don't you know

690
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:52,319
they look a little yellow or something

691
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,640
like that okay i might need to feed them

692
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:55,839
a little bit but i just don't i and i

693
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,759
see people that

694
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,798
they water every day they get nutrients

695
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:00,558
every day

696
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,639
they're just you know i'm hitting it

697
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:06,079
hard with the newts and you know and i'm

698
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,080
just like oh yeah like what you know

699
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,558
because that just builds up all that

700
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:14,319
salt and that soil and it's just got

701
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:15,918
nowhere to go and it's that you

702
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,839
especially you know with the over

703
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,640
watering because because

704
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,079
over watering you brought the root hairs

705
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,720
and um

706
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,960
that's then they can't take up nutrients

707
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,360
um you know they there's individual

708
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,840
hairs that pick up certain

709
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,119
new parts and

710
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:34,959
particulates you know when you you burn

711
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,959
them up with nutrients or you and you

712
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,880
over water them and they can't take it

713
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,880
all they can take up is water

714
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,400
and i and like you said i have a buddy

715
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,720
that um

716
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,640
every time he gets the fires um

717
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,640
four weeks into flowering my i come home

718
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,400
my plants just fell over

719
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,799
i don't know what happened

720
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,120
and it was you know he over watered them

721
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:57,119
when he vegeta they couldn't take up the

722
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:59,199
nitrogen they needed in veg because they

723
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,839
don't take it up and flower

724
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,080
and then they run out and they just go

725
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:06,079
and they just fall over that's the you

726
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,678
know that's usually the answer you know

727
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:08,480
the answer to that

728
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,720
and

729
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,960
you know the overwatering thing i mean i

730
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,640
really can't stress enough about because

731
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,079
i think that's probably the number one

732
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,559
problem

733
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,480
that new growers do they think that soil

734
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,720
has to be wet all the time and this this

735
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,599
plant is just not like that

736
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,919
at all

737
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,678
how do you go about watering in order to

738
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,880
ensure that there's over watering

739
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,720
doesn't happen

740
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,320
well i always water when i water my

741
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,798
water to run off i make sure that the

742
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,879
pot is completely saturated i've got

743
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:38,798
water coming out um

744
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,480
i'm careful that i'm not you know trying

745
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:42,480
to do it too fast where i'm getting the

746
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,798
runoff off the sides you know i you got

747
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,558
to get a field and then i get to feel

748
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:48,639
the pot i know how much it is when it's

749
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,558
heavy and then i don't water it again

750
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,200
until i can just pick it up with my

751
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:55,759
finger it's it's like super light you

752
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,558
know i just wait until it's it's dried

753
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:59,759
dried out or i see some kind of if it

754
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:01,599
looks like it's

755
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:03,200
you know wilting a little bit you know

756
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,439
these are kind of bend down a little bit

757
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,120
i try i don't like it you know under

758
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,759
watering is bad too

759
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:10,798
but it's not as bad as over

760
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:12,798
um

761
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,798
you can if you start seeing wilting you

762
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:17,278
know okay if you write everything down

763
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,960
which i also recommend if you've got a

764
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:21,119
garden you should be if you're watering

765
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,120
feeding you should be at least

766
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:24,879
writing that down water feed or

767
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:27,119
something you know at the very bare

768
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,760
minimum so that you could go okay i

769
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:32,158
watered five days ago wilted today

770
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,519
next time i water i'm gonna do it a day

771
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,159
earlier

772
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,960
you know and uh my

773
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,960
like my uh the flower plant i have is in

774
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,720
a seven gallon pot

775
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,960
and for the first four weeks i only

776
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,558
watered it um once a week

777
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,640
it just now

778
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,720
you know in week five

779
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,559
i'm starting to water it almost twice a

780
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,839
week it's just starting to take up a lot

781
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:55,519
more water and

782
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,119
you know it's starting to bulk up so

783
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,440
it's it's drinking

784
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,599
and taking up nutrients

785
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,840
yeah i do a very similar method where i

786
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,678
let it dry out between waterings when

787
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,079
i'm growing with synthetic nutrients in

788
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,919
particular dry backs like that drought

789
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:12,158
stress a lot of people say that that

790
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,799
helps with the secondary metabolites you

791
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,440
know those trichome production so it's a

792
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:20,398
form of stress precision stress that's

793
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,840
bringing out what we want in the plants

794
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:23,839
so uh yeah i thought that was worth

795
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,959
mentioning there now are you aiming for

796
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:29,199
a specific ec or ppm during the

797
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,240
different stages of growth or what

798
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,798
um well i kind of i kind of look at ppm

799
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,278
like food calories um

800
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:39,519
you got a young plant um you give it the

801
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:42,398
kids meal you know the lower calorie

802
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:44,558
diet um you got a big plant it's you

803
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:47,119
know it might need the super-sized fries

804
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:48,798
and to go along with it it's kind of

805
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,439
based on the size

806
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:53,038
um the type of plant you know some grow

807
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,159
slower than others a slower growing

808
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,679
plant

809
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,000
doesn't need as much as a you know

810
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,440
faster growing one it's not it's not

811
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,599
like the it's kind of like the couch

812
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,640
potato versus the athlete you know the

813
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:03,918
ones that are

814
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,759
like certain

815
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,038
certain cultivars grow really really

816
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:08,798
fast

817
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:10,640
yeah there's a relationship between heat

818
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:12,158
nutrients in the mild water the plant

819
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,720
drinks

820
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,399
so if it's you've got hot temperatures

821
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,240
and the plants drinking twice as much

822
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,158
water you also got to remember it's

823
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,120
taking up twice as many nutrients as

824
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,360
well

825
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:24,719
so you know if you're if you're if

826
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:26,398
you're putting a lot of nutrients in

827
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,880
there and your your tent's running at a

828
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,558
very high temperature you know

829
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,679
you run the risk of

830
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:33,759
you know

831
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,480
burning your plants up

832
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,440
and you know i i want to say all the

833
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,159
the thing you want to do as a new

834
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,240
growers you want to eliminate as many

835
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,399
places that you can go wrong as possible

836
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,399
you know take those variables out

837
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,479
you know don't don't work hard to throw

838
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:51,439
things in that can go wrong

839
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,839
um just just because you know you you've

840
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,679
seen it on youtube or you know you read

841
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:56,839
it on the internet or

842
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,600
you know

843
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:01,918
some you know so your body told you this

844
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,119
is this is what you do

845
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,600
gotcha

846
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,439
i also want to get into ph you talked

847
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:10,158
about how ph was super important when it

848
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,679
comes to dwc hydroponics and soil a lot

849
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,039
of people argue that it's not as

850
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,080
important

851
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:18,000
what's your take on ph specifically when

852
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,960
growing in soil talk to us about do you

853
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,319
monitor ph if so what do you aim for so

854
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,640
on and so forth well i i aim between

855
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:29,519
five and seven if i'm mixing my

856
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,000
nutrients and they're out of that range

857
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:34,558
which you know some sometimes i have you

858
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,759
know i'll get i use a lot more ph up for

859
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,158
some reason probably because of the

860
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,000
arrow water than i do down

861
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,159
but you know i bring it back and i'll

862
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,839
add a little bit to it and if it gets

863
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,720
five point something

864
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:48,558
or six point something i don't care i'm

865
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,798
not adding more to it i'm not trying to

866
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:53,599
dial in that number

867
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:55,759
um because that is that

868
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,918
you don't realize how big of a range

869
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,359
that really is because it's not really a

870
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,399
linear scale

871
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:04,000
ph

872
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:08,079
like uh the difference between um

873
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,480
uh 6.9 ph and seven is is it's actually

874
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:12,240
ten times difference

875
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,960
so if you multiply that over the whole

876
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,038
range between five and seven i mean

877
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,038
that's such a wide range that why would

878
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,759
how could there be one

879
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:24,000
specific number that is absolutely

880
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:26,879
perfect you know for

881
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,398
every situation i mean really it's about

882
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,159
um

883
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,798
you know i know people argue that

884
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,600
there's a certain ph it makes nutrients

885
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,759
more available to the plant but that 507

886
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:39,439
range covers it

887
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:40,558
it really does you know there's not

888
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,919
going to be

889
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:43,599
any any

890
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,520
kind of thing going on there unless

891
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:47,199
there's an issue with over watering and

892
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,440
you've brought the repairs and they

893
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,399
can't absorb the nutrients okay let's

894
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,720
move on to environment a little bit

895
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:56,719
temperature humidity a lot of people aim

896
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,240
for certain ranges for those things

897
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,159
let's start with temperature what do you

898
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:05,440
usually aim for well i my lung room it

899
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,679
will basically vary anywhere between 65

900
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,880
and 75 degrees you know depending on

901
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,600
what kind of season it is um

902
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,600
and i try to keep temperature i i

903
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,119
basically try to keep the long room

904
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:18,719
comfortable for me because i know if

905
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,319
it's comfortable for me it's comfortable

906
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,558
for the plants

907
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:24,319
obviously the lights you know add heat

908
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:25,278
or whatever

909
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:28,079
um

910
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:31,839
but i've i've had no you know when i've

911
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:34,000
had no issues you know i've had 10 15

912
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:35,359
temperature swings at night

913
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,038
absolutely no

914
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,000
no real issues

915
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:40,079
um

916
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,679
the only time temperature really

917
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,359
might be an issue for me is when i got

918
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,278
seedlings or something like that you

919
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,119
know i might use a little heat mat just

920
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,880
to you know kind of a little bit more

921
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:49,759
radiant heat

922
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,159
um

923
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:54,079
but i don't really i mean i mantra i

924
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,880
like to know what it is it tells me if

925
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,879
something's wrong if i do you know if i

926
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,360
if i see that my humidity all of a

927
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,720
sudden is is seventy percent

928
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,759
i must have forgot to empty the

929
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,240
dehumidifier or you know it's it's more

930
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:10,000
of a i'm looking for the extremes

931
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,079
more than a precise

932
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,880
area kind of just like i treat it just

933
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:16,319
like the ph as if i'm in that that happy

934
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,480
zone somewhere

935
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,599
um i'm not gonna spend a whole lot of

936
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,960
effort to chase a number or get a like

937
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:24,000
vpd

938
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,079
um

939
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,440
you know i don't really worry about that

940
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:28,960
that doesn't

941
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,159
you know there's

942
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,240
there's no

943
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,039
vpd in mother nature

944
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,120
i wouldn't say you know the

945
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:38,879
it's it just it's just not for the

946
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:40,479
amount of effort that it would take to

947
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,640
try to maintain

948
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,200
um that environment

949
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,799
i just don't see the the need to chase

950
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,000
something like that especially if you're

951
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,839
starting out maybe if you're in a

952
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,240
facility and you're you're trying to

953
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:54,240
dial you know i mean you're i don't know

954
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,159
even then i wouldn't

955
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,480
you know i wouldn't see the value

956
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,320
there's no value added in it for me and

957
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,319
my girl

958
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,639
let's put it that way i'm not saying

959
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,398
there's something wrong with it or

960
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,880
whatever but it's just not something

961
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:10,158
that you know that i focus on

962
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,240
a lot of people are actually within the

963
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,200
vpd range without even trying you know

964
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,319
they'll look at the chart and they're

965
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,120
like oh i'm there already and they're

966
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:19,119
not even like no effort my ac infinity

967
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,278
my ac infinity controllers will it gives

968
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:23,038
me a vpd reading i know it's a little

969
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:24,880
off because i don't i don't enter the

970
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:27,038
leaf temperature or anything but it's

971
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,880
always one two one three you know it's

972
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:31,200
always right around there

973
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,240
you know it's not that far off

974
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,440
you know depending on what chart you're

975
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,278
looking at too and there's all these

976
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,440
different charts too you know it's like

977
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,919
which chart is the real chart

978
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,759
you know it's it's uh

979
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,360
why check why spend the time

980
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:44,960
now you're absolutely right there's ours

981
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:47,519
there are several charts out there and

982
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,038
it makes things confusing because you

983
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,558
look at one chart and you think you're

984
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:52,558
in the right range you look at another

985
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:54,480
chart and you're out of range

986
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:55,839
but yeah there's that that dark green

987
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,679
range which is said to be the most

988
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:59,278
optimal range then there's the light

989
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,200
green range and then there's the the

990
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:02,720
yellow range i think is the the

991
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,360
tolerance range and then you've got the

992
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,038
red range right so like there's a really

993
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:08,960
really wide range that the plant will

994
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:10,639
grow in so if you're a beginner yeah

995
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,760
chasing after vpd

996
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,440
you probably don't want to do that for

997
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,200
your first several grows well that was

998
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,519
something i picked up growing outdoors

999
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,239
too because i mean the northeast is is

1000
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,280
just

1001
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,519
it could

1002
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,119
you can get all four seasons in like one

1003
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:25,119
day here

1004
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,519
and uh i

1005
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,679
the first year i'm like are you worried

1006
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:31,280
it's just like it hasn't rained in like

1007
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,440
three days you know he's like oh i gave

1008
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,960
it water a couple days ago it'll be fine

1009
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,559
you know and then

1010
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,720
i'm like oh my gosh that did you see

1011
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,320
that wind last night you know this blew

1012
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,480
the thing it'll be fine don't worry

1013
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,720
about it you know and then towards the

1014
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,679
end you know that towards the end it's

1015
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,519
dropping down to like 45 at night and

1016
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,358
i'm like don't isn't it getting too cold

1017
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,440
at night no it'll be fine don't worry

1018
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:56,159
about it you know the plant it does

1019
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:59,200
great it i never you know i seen wild

1020
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,519
swings and outdoor temperature hail

1021
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:03,919
you know you name it it's it'll throw it

1022
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:07,519
at that plant and it it does great

1023
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,440
sometimes it helps you know the plant

1024
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:12,719
like you said the stress

1025
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,960
um the stress i remember one plant we

1026
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:16,719
put outside in the wood chuck split

1027
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,159
right down and just took it and split it

1028
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,239
right down the middle

1029
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,559
and we duct taped it all up put a

1030
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:24,479
tobacco extract a tomato cage around it

1031
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:27,519
and that plant was the biggest yielding

1032
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,440
plant that we we ever had it just that's

1033
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:32,159
whatever it was it just kicked it into

1034
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,400
like some kind of super mode

1035
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:38,399
that's wild so maybe the stock splitting

1036
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,400
technique isn't actually bro science

1037
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,880
you know if you shake if you shake your

1038
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:45,439
plants up you you inadvertently are

1039
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,039
going to split spot and it's it's

1040
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,320
you know you remember the first time

1041
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:49,920
that you ever topped your plant and

1042
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,838
you're holding the clippers there and

1043
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,680
your hands are shaking and it's like oh

1044
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:55,920
my god what am i about to do here and

1045
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:57,759
you cut that off and you know the first

1046
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,200
time you're trying to bend the branch

1047
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,040
and you just split it or you break it

1048
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,199
and you're like oh crap

1049
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:08,000
you know but it's just it's duct tape

1050
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:09,199
fixes fixes quite a bit and they you

1051
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,719
know if

1052
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:13,358
it does you know when it does heal it's

1053
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:15,199
a big knuckle it's a you know it's a

1054
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:16,960
the plant responds pretty good to it you

1055
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:19,039
can't be afraid to

1056
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,440
manhandle them a little bit i think they

1057
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:23,119
like it when you when you

1058
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,200
bend them and break them they are

1059
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,760
resilient plants and most of the time

1060
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,838
they will recover fully one more thing i

1061
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,119
want to touch upon you touched upon it

1062
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:32,400
first when we talked about temperature

1063
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,920
and i just want to circle back to it and

1064
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,680
then we'll move on which is you talked

1065
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,358
about the lung room temperature and i'm

1066
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:38,319
really really glad you brought that up

1067
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:39,920
because

1068
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,720
that's an important piece that a lot of

1069
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,240
people

1070
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:43,759
don't bring up they just talk about the

1071
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:45,519
temperature in their grow environment in

1072
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,119
their their grow tent for example but

1073
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,759
the lung room for those that don't know

1074
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,760
is the room that your grow tent is in

1075
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,440
for example so a lot of people will

1076
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,240
condition that room with the proper

1077
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,159
temperature and humidity uh and you said

1078
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:00,000
it's between 65 and 75 degrees

1079
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:02,239
fahrenheit which is usually slightly

1080
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,400
lower than what people typically run

1081
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:07,039
into grow tents you know 75

1082
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,039
upwards of 80 sometimes up to 85 degrees

1083
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,199
fahrenheit but it's important because

1084
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:12,320
when you're bringing air into the grow

1085
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,078
environment

1086
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,240
if you're aiming for 80 degrees

1087
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,839
fahrenheit temperature for example and

1088
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:19,838
that's what's in your grow tent and

1089
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:21,920
that's what's in your lung room from my

1090
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:24,480
experience i've always run into issues

1091
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,440
if my lung room is similar temperature

1092
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,358
to what's in my grow tent because

1093
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,280
you're just bringing in more heat right

1094
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:32,880
and your growth your grow light is

1095
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,079
creating that heat

1096
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,480
and you're just

1097
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,119
you're just running into heat issues so

1098
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,199
i think that's a great tip is to run a

1099
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,200
little bit lower of a temp in your lung

1100
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:45,039
room uh and of course having to be the

1101
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:46,799
proper humidity that you're aiming for

1102
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:48,639
have that in your lung room as well so

1103
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,240
the air you're bringing into your grow

1104
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:55,279
tent is of the ideal range right and

1105
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,559
when you start having to add um heat or

1106
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,400
or cooling

1107
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:01,039
you're adding money

1108
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,838
to to your grow that's it's you know

1109
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,519
once you do that is it is it cost

1110
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:07,599
efficient to grow

1111
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:09,358
you know if you've got to spend a lot of

1112
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,400
money and i'm fortunate that i have the

1113
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:12,480
ducting

1114
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,599
you know already there you know and i

1115
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,320
could add just a little bit of

1116
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,240
supplemental heat you know and one of

1117
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,039
the times that it needs it you know and

1118
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:19,759
then

1119
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:21,119
i

1120
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,640
can put it away it's kind of like the

1121
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,400
dehumidifier

1122
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:26,159
the heater and the dehumidifier i have

1123
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,920
they're both about what i think the

1124
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:29,519
heater is a little more watts

1125
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,358
but i'll use i'll use the heater in the

1126
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,280
winter and then i use the dehumidifier

1127
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:35,440
in the summer and it you know i don't

1128
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,320
use the two at the same time

1129
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,320
um and it just works out it works out

1130
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,920
well i'm just fortunate with the the

1131
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,680
grow space that i have

1132
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,720
that it that maintains such a good

1133
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:46,960
temperature

1134
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:49,039
it can certainly be super expensive when

1135
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,519
you have all this equipment heater air

1136
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:53,519
conditioner dehumidifier

1137
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:56,159
all those things add up in your

1138
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,759
electricity bill and i know i've had

1139
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:59,118
shock before looking at my electricity

1140
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,880
bill i'm like what the heck happened

1141
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,119
here specifically when i was running a

1142
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,880
portable air conditioner and i got rid

1143
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,880
of it because i was just like forget it

1144
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,160
it's not worth it it's financially it's

1145
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,800
just it's not worth it to run it all the

1146
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:14,078
time and yeah definitely one thing to

1147
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,160
evaluate is how much equipment you're

1148
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,079
having and the energy consumption even

1149
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:20,000
the dehumidifier you know i have one of

1150
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,000
those things that test the lots i had no

1151
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,639
no clue that that thing was drawn 600

1152
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,320
watts you know that's as much as that's

1153
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:28,239
another light in your

1154
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,599
growth space you know and that's you

1155
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:31,118
know my first girl i was running that

1156
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,359
thing all the time

1157
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,358
you know i'm i'm glad i figured that out

1158
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:36,799
and i don't have to do that anymore yeah

1159
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:38,559
yeah it's definitely good the less

1160
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,440
energy consumption the better let's move

1161
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:43,279
on to plant training something that a

1162
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,920
lot of new growers do can be very

1163
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,839
beneficial for numerous reasons talk to

1164
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,079
us about how you do your plan training

1165
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:52,239
well i start right in the solo cups as

1166
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,599
soon as i start seeing those nodes

1167
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:55,598
developing on

1168
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,240
on the branches on the stems and i've

1169
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:01,200
got a couple nodes there and it looks

1170
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:04,159
like a good good spot to nip it off i'll

1171
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:05,519
i'll nip that top off right there

1172
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:07,598
you know if you call feminine just

1173
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:09,199
taking the one top note then you know

1174
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,960
there's a debate on what

1175
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:13,598
what it means but

1176
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,480
anyways i'll do that

1177
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,400
and then i also

1178
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,400
clean up the bottoms anything that's not

1179
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,160
going to catch up to the top any lower

1180
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,960
branches

1181
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:26,239
i'll cut them off early too you know so

1182
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,679
i start

1183
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:31,358
start there um as the plant goes i'm

1184
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:34,318
always trying to open up the plant my

1185
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:39,039
goal is to make the plant low and wide

1186
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:40,880
i don't want um big tall legs

1187
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,039
facility legs you know you see those

1188
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,039
videos at the facilities and you know

1189
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,679
the legs are like six feet long and then

1190
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:50,000
there's like this three foot canopy

1191
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:52,639
but your light only you know led will

1192
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,199
penetrate two feet uh 18

1193
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:57,598
hps three feet maybe

1194
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:59,838
so where did all that time go to grow

1195
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,079
all you know all those legs all that leg

1196
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:04,480
is kind of wasted time

1197
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,079
um especially you know if you're in a

1198
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,280
facility and you have 20 foot ceilings

1199
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,280
and you can have your lights all the way

1200
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,200
up there you know okay

1201
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,880
but you gotta if you're growing intent

1202
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:15,118
you can only get so high

1203
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,800
you know the taller you know

1204
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,720
you know as i learned on my first grow

1205
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,839
it's very you know once

1206
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:22,078
a lot of people don't

1207
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:26,000
don't anticipate the stretch

1208
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,119
either that's that's the other thing um

1209
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,960
they uh

1210
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,880
you know topping your plant i think is

1211
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,720
the most important thing i see a lot of

1212
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,200
new growers where they they grow like

1213
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:37,358
the the spears where there's just one

1214
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:39,358
giant big bud in the center

1215
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:41,838
and then a couple auxiliaries off the

1216
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:44,239
top you know because it you know once if

1217
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:46,559
you don't top that plant that that top

1218
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:47,519
apical

1219
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:49,039
bud

1220
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:50,318
is going to get all the energy all those

1221
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:53,119
other ones they're just getting the

1222
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:55,119
scraps what's left over you know when

1223
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,358
when the big bug eats you know they just

1224
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,358
get the table scraps where if you top

1225
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:01,759
your plant you widen them out

1226
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:03,679
um that that is the energy is

1227
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,680
distributed more evenly

1228
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:08,639
i mean you might not get this

1229
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:10,719
sphere of a bug but you're going to get

1230
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:13,440
the tops which you know we all know

1231
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:16,000
that's the that's the best part

1232
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,639
of the bug

1233
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,159
um you know i bend them i break them you

1234
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:22,879
know when i'm trying to widen them out

1235
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:25,759
you know if i get i get i can either top

1236
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,160
them to just shorten them up to let the

1237
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,960
other branches catch up or i can bend

1238
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:31,920
them down and you know i don't tie them

1239
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,599
down

1240
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,170
i don't think that's a

1241
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,559
um

1242
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:38,880
[Music]

1243
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:40,159
effective way to do it it's really hard

1244
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,680
believe it or not the plant's pretty

1245
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:43,358
strong

1246
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:45,039
you know you can tie it down and it will

1247
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:45,838
turn a corner and still go straight up

1248
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:47,358
on you

1249
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:49,838
you know

1250
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,279
if you if you if you break the herd you

1251
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:53,279
bend the branch

1252
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,800
um when you're down you know i you know

1253
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,599
i'll go down there and check to see if

1254
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,599
the

1255
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,519
buckets are light or something and now

1256
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,359
well that that one's a little

1257
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:03,039
too tall get a little twist and bend it

1258
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:04,559
down a little bit trying to you know

1259
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,800
always building it it's all about the

1260
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,880
canopy you can't be canopy canopy all

1261
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,800
right from the first time i'm throwing

1262
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,200
the solo cups right up to when i put

1263
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,359
them in the flour yeah and just to

1264
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:17,118
clarify you can totally just grow the

1265
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:20,159
plant naturally and let that one cola

1266
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,280
come up but you are prone to bud rot for

1267
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,000
example i

1268
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,560
i encountered that before it's just it's

1269
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,239
tough getting air through the buds there

1270
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,880
and if there's stagnant air at all i

1271
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:33,279
actually had a fan that died and uh it

1272
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,920
died overnight and the mold started to

1273
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,359
occur got the fan fixed but

1274
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,800
i didn't notice it right away so i had

1275
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:41,039
the plants continue to grow for a couple

1276
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,119
weeks well that mold just doesn't stop

1277
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:45,199
growing right it can it will continue to

1278
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,039
grow even if you've got the airflow at

1279
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:48,879
that point you're screwed but you know

1280
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:50,960
if it's your first grow grow the plant

1281
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,039
naturally that's fine but training is

1282
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,400
definitely beneficial so yeah just like

1283
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:56,800
you mentioned it yeah you can't be

1284
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,160
afraid of it you really can't be i know

1285
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,480
i know for some people that you know

1286
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:02,000
these like they see the beautiful

1287
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,920
i don't want to cut that off my plant

1288
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,358
you know it's such a it's so beautiful

1289
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,280
it's growing so good i'm going to chop

1290
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:08,799
its head off what are you kidding me i'm

1291
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,960
not gonna do that

1292
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,318
um but the benefits you know of training

1293
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,800
far outweigh

1294
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:19,039
you know the you know anything you know

1295
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,560
as long as you're doing it correctly

1296
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:22,639
you know you're not

1297
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:25,358
you're not doing anything crazy

1298
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:27,358
um shaping up your clients is you know

1299
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:29,358
is super important

1300
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:31,039
i completely agree with that

1301
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:32,799
so we're coming up towards the end of

1302
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:34,880
the episode and i know we can't talk

1303
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,800
about every single thing there is to do

1304
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,720
about growing here i do want to give you

1305
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,400
one last opportunity to give advice for

1306
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:42,078
beginners is there something maybe that

1307
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,680
we missed in this episode something you

1308
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,359
think that's super important that new

1309
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:49,039
growers need to hear

1310
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:50,559
um okay uh start small keep it simple

1311
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:52,880
you know you i think you want to make

1312
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:55,358
sure growing's for you first um some

1313
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,440
people it's it's just not you might have

1314
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:59,519
a really weird environment you know and

1315
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,679
just are you know just

1316
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:02,800
some people just it's just not for them

1317
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:03,919
you know and then they end up spending a

1318
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,318
lot of money in the beginning and

1319
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,318
they're just you know discouraged just

1320
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:10,400
start small

1321
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:12,639
and you know a lot of in

1322
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,800
a lot of most first-time growers they

1323
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:17,039
fit they do fail

1324
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,960
um don't be afraid to fail

1325
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:20,480
you know and you know embrace it learn

1326
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,240
from it you know i

1327
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,240
i really took a hard look at my first

1328
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:26,078
grow and i didn't give up and saw my

1329
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,239
equipment you know i said what did i do

1330
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,000
what could i do better and i still do

1331
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:32,639
after every girl you know what can i

1332
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,519
always what can i do better next time

1333
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:37,039
um and also take everything you see on

1334
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:38,400
youtube read on the internet with a

1335
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:40,559
grain of salt

1336
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,079
you know kind of do

1337
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:43,838
you know do your own

1338
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,920
back research too if you see something

1339
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:49,039
on one site and i don't know about that

1340
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:51,039
you know go look around and and see

1341
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:53,358
and soon you'll find out that there's a

1342
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:54,480
contradiction for just and for

1343
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:55,358
everything

1344
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,039
and then

1345
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:58,318
you start to learn that you know i need

1346
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:59,519
to form you need to form your own

1347
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:01,759
opinions

1348
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:03,759
about about things and not rely on

1349
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,760
somebody else there's no secret nobody's

1350
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,079
got no there's no youtube channel or

1351
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,760
where we've got some secret recipe that

1352
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,920
okay here's the list of things that you

1353
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,640
do and you're gonna get a tent full of

1354
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,480
buzz it just doesn't exist

1355
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:17,598
you know i think that we

1356
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,960
think

1357
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,880
you know people think we're hiding in

1358
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,599
some kind of secret you know secret

1359
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,119
sauce or there's no secret nutrient

1360
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,280
you know no no

1361
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,880
no secret light you know there's no

1362
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,160
secret technique or

1363
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,000
secret method it's you know it's

1364
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:35,838
a lot of different ways work but you

1365
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,519
just can't give up you know don't don't

1366
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:39,519
quit if it's something you really want

1367
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:41,199
to do

1368
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:42,880
and leave your plants alone i don't

1369
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:45,279
think i touched on that

1370
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,960
earlier too at all

1371
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,760
you don't need to be down in your tent

1372
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,639
like 17 times a day opening it up

1373
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,160
um

1374
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:54,480
then looking

1375
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:56,239
in there they you know you don't need

1376
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,240
you just you just leave them you know

1377
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:59,919
you you do your water and you do things

1378
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:01,199
you got to do and you just leave them

1379
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,559
alone you know you're opening and

1380
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:03,679
closing the tank you're changing the

1381
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:06,159
environment

1382
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:08,239
every time you go into your grill your

1383
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:11,358
you run the risk you might bring some

1384
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:12,559
kind of pest in there or you know or or

1385
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:14,318
something you might forget to turn the

1386
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:15,599
light off when you leave

1387
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:18,079
you know go down there when you gotta go

1388
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,760
down there i you know i go down check it

1389
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,720
quit you know i might go down once a day

1390
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,480
just to make sure everything's still

1391
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:24,639
running you know

1392
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,079
nothing's going on

1393
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:27,920
what helped me because it was hard for

1394
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,519
me to let go of it too because you you

1395
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,800
know you're so interested and invested

1396
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:32,000
in this that you would just want to be

1397
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,079
down there you want to see it you want

1398
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,800
to see what's going on you know i bought

1399
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,318
some cameras that i can look on my phone

1400
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,000
you know so i thought i'm thinking i

1401
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:41,679
don't know what's going on down there so

1402
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,880
you know i'm just you know thinking of

1403
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:44,078
my head well maybe i want to go down

1404
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,000
there and see what's going on i can just

1405
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,318
go in the camera and look in there

1406
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,480
there's nothing going on

1407
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:52,480
turn the camera off and you know thought

1408
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,358
leaves my head but it's real important

1409
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,039
just

1410
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:57,358
the the plant's been growing on its own

1411
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:59,039
for millions of years it really needs

1412
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:00,558
very little from us

1413
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:02,800
you know we just got to really stay out

1414
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,680
of its way and you know let it do its

1415
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,240
thing

1416
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:07,039
you know like like protect always says

1417
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:08,239
you know

1418
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:10,960
relax

1419
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:12,639
you know breathe it's okay it's you know

1420
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,400
it's just it's really just a plant it's

1421
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,960
really just a house plant i mean it's

1422
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,800
there's when you look at it like that

1423
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,480
and it's it

1424
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,599
and you treat them like that

1425
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,358
you you get a lot more success it's it's

1426
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,039
i really believe that

1427
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:29,279
i like the way you go about things

1428
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:31,519
definitely uh you got the right mindset

1429
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,599
for sure thank you i do want to add in

1430
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,119
one more tip that's just coming to my

1431
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,318
mind i'm thinking back to when i was a

1432
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,240
beginner

1433
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:40,000
one thing that helped me was

1434
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:42,399
setting up the equipment and before even

1435
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
putting the plants in the tent

1436
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,400
having the light on having your

1437
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,440
humidifier on your ventilation all

1438
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,880
hooked up

1439
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,800
and then monitoring the temperature and

1440
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,480
humidity and seeing if it's in the range

1441
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,720
seeing if it you know if your your

1442
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,400
temperature spiking like crazy so you

1443
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:58,318
can take action before you put plants in

1444
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,480
there and then try to balance it now of

1445
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:01,920
course this isn't going to be foolproof

1446
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,400
once you have plants in there the plants

1447
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,440
transpire they release water vapor into

1448
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,519
the air it's going to adjust your

1449
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,519
humidity but it can certainly in my

1450
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:10,800
opinion be beneficial to have the

1451
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:12,800
equipment in there

1452
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,480
have your light on let it run and then

1453
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,160
monitor and try to adjust things from

1454
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,000
there so just think i'd throw that one

1455
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:19,440
out there as well yeah there's nothing

1456
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,358
wrong with monitoring

1457
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,400
you know it's good to know you know i'm

1458
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:26,159
glad i did there was in my first grow

1459
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,240
and i noticed quite right away as soon

1460
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:30,879
as the lights went out because my my

1461
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:33,679
ambient room temperature was low

1462
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,760
you know once that hps cuts off it cools

1463
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:37,199
off pretty quick that tent cools off

1464
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,920
pretty quick and once that tent cools

1465
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:42,480
off the humidity just like

1466
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,720
so it totally it told me something it

1467
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,599
told me i needed more ventilation in my

1468
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:47,199
town

1469
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,720
you know to account for the fact when

1470
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:52,239
the lights go off and that humidity

1471
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:54,879
arises so that i'm not getting you know

1472
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:57,358
raining in the inside

1473
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,880
after the lights go out so

1474
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:00,880
yeah but it's it's good to know all

1475
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,318
these things but it's like i said don't

1476
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,280
don't chase us

1477
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:06,239
a vpd number a ph number

1478
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,319
um

1479
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:10,399
you know the par thing it's it's just

1480
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:12,318
just just look at your your plants will

1481
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:15,200
tell you what you need what you need to

1482
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:16,079
do you know don't just don't more is not

1483
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:17,439
better

1484
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,800
you know sometimes the more you do the

1485
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,240
less you get

1486
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,079
absolutely

1487
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:24,159
so wrapping things up how can the

1488
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,880
listeners find you and what do you have

1489

soon

1496
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:43,838
uh you know i ended up having covered

1497
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:45,679
twice during 15 months so my youtube

1498
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:46,558
channel suffered a little bit

1499
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:49,118
um

1500
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,160
and pretty much just making music videos

1501
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,760

1502
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:53,519

1503
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,200

1504
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:58,000

1506
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,039
um i've got a mother plant and you know

1507
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,920
document the whole process hopefully

1508
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,159
so

1509
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,159
and

1510
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:10,559
that big plant i have that maybe single

1511
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,000
plant i haven't flower that should be

1512
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,319
harvesting

1513
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,039
in maybe three more weeks

1514
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:17,199
so

1515
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:18,800
i last last uh

1516
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,399
harvest i i was messing around with the

1517
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,200
time lapse video so i had a lot of fun

1518
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:26,000
with that you know condensing the whole

1519
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:28,000
chopping process and tr and

1520
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,079
bucking the buds onto like a three

1521
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,679
minute video and it really took about it

1522
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,119
took all these hours

1523
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:34,879
you know just to watch that was pretty

1524
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,480
cool and put some you know i do stuff

1525
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:41,760
like that um i think next up i've got

1526
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,920
some black widows and i end up with

1527
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,559
three black widows and one white widow

1528
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:49,519
out of the last batch of

1529
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,599
beans that i i popped so they're looking

1530
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:54,079

1531
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:55,838
