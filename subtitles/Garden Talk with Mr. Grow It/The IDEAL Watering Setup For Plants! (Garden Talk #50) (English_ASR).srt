1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
coming up on garden talk in a fabric pot

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,080
situation that doesn't have that living

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,519
soil liner we want to bring drippers or

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,720
emitters we want to bring them further

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:10,718
out towards the edge of the pot

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,120
generally so that we can keep that edge

7
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:15,759
more consistently hydrated so as the

8
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,600
soil moisture dries out it dries out

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,600
this ceramic tip just a bit and that

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,520
pulls some of the water that's inside

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,679
down into the ceramic itself which

12
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,839
creates a negative hydrostatic pressure

13
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,599
if you want that nice even watering

14
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,839
coverage and you know maintaining that

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,320
upper level of soil very very moist and

16
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,640
consistent three drippers is is a good

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,719
way to go so the solution to that is

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,200
peck acid there's a product called drip

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,960
clean that's like super common yeah

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,800
using that like as directed on the

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,120
bottles that'll take care of all those

22
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,878
issues happening is the plants is going

23
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,038
and grabbing the valve the water control

24
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,399
valve and now the plant's in control of

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,719
how it gets watered and when it gets

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,719
watered

27
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,439
what's up everybody if you that don't

28
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,718

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,759
think it's important for me to reiterate

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,840
my vision for this podcast my vision for

41
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,000
this podcast is to talk to growers from

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,759
all over the world both beginners and

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,359
experts and seek to learn more about

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,719
what they know about gardening i'm not

45
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,959
going to judge people for the way that

46
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,560
they grow and this isn't a debate i'm

47
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,640
simply seeking to learn more about the

48
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,799

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,720

134
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,720
three years two three years ago yeah i

135
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,319

136
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,000
yeah we were i think you're out there

137
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,399
with chris there that one time yeah

138
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
chris from happy hydro yeah my

139
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,159
uh he's actually on episode three of

140
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,439
this garden talk so oh excellent yeah

141
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,280
we've been working with chris for a long

142
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,478
time too he's kind of a friend of the

143
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,039
company

144
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,399
nice nice yeah but you know all about

145
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,039
irrigation and that's what we're going

146
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,959
to get into today really i think most of

147
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,319
my audiences probably home growers

148
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,079
certainly do have a folks on the

149
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,759
commercial side of things i would think

150
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,199
more of them are more indoor versus

151
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,199
outdoor but i'm sure we'll talk about

152
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,038
things that are relevant towards

153
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,478
everybody now one of the things i want

154
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:17,439
to get we'll go over in this episode

155
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:19,519
would be

156
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,918
the different common container sizes and

157
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,359
how the best way to irrigate them is you

158
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:24,639
know i know a lot of folks are hand

159
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,639
watering right now but they're

160
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,639
interested in actually going to the

161
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,918
automated system so we'll go over you

162
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,360
know what the different automated

163
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,680
systems are the different options for

164
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,840
the different container sizes so on and

165
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,600
so forth so it should be valuable on

166
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,079
that aspect but

167
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,600
but uh first before we get into that can

168
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,959
you give us an introduction tell us a

169
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,960
little bit about yourself and kind of

170
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,000
how you got into gardening

171
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:50,399
uh yeah absolutely um

172
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,478
uh yeah uh i i currently well so i

173
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,879
currently work for a sustainable village

174
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,758
we're based out of boulder colorado

175
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,519
um

176
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,720
and

177
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,839
you know the sustainable village has

178
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,639
been around for

179
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:04,959
about 20 years

180
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,280
i've been here in this role

181
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,918
as the lead designer and

182
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,799
a bunch of other things for probably uh

183
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,399
four years now and kind of been

184
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,439
friends of the company here for a while

185
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,439
donor for a long time

186
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:23,758
as far as my own personal background

187
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,520
i got into working on organic farms as a

188
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,520
teenager back in

189
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,240
pennsylvania where i grew up working on

190
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:34,478
organic farms back there and

191
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,960
once i moved out to colorado in 2000 i

192
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:39,120
was involved with the local farm scene

193
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,560
here quite a bit and the permaculture

194
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,240
community did

195
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,360
permaculture design certification about

196
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,360
12 years ago i've

197
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,800
run a market garden here in boulder

198
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,720
county and a

199
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,000
csa program and

200
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,599
a farmers market stand

201
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,319
as part of the farmers market

202
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,519
and uh yeah just you know that's some of

203
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,520
the background i have i've just always

204
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,038
been an avid gardener

205
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,198
you know personally i've done it in

206
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,639
commercial settings um

207
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,639
you know i've been

208
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,598
in colorado here for like the last 12

209
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,960
years

210
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,399
you know there's some newer industries

211
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,879
and i've been involved with those as

212
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,000
well as far as gardening goes

213
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,038
we've been really heavily involved in

214
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,478
those industries to be particular um

215
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,478
and uh

216
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:24,079
yeah that's a real real brief background

217
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,839
uh throughout all that time i've always

218
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,439
been very very interested in irrigation

219
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,519
though so

220
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,279
i don't know i like water i like rivers

221
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,359
i like i like moving water in general

222
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:36,399
it's just the theme in my life

223
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,240
and uh so i've always been involved in

224
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,638
irrigation design and installation kind

225
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,680
of run my own install design companies

226
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,960
and then

227
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,959
you know being able to be here at

228
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,878
sustainable village

229
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,198
for the last while we've been able to

230
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,759
take a lot of um well so at sustainable

231
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,840
village here we sell uh blue mats

232
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,319
which we can get into later but they're

233
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,719
these moisture sensing valves they're

234
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,319
carrots they're ceramic carrot

235
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,919
and yeah we can dive into those and talk

236
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,199
about how they work but what's been

237
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,079
really cool here uh is is to take some

238
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,598
of the

239
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,000
some of the designs and the strategies

240
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,279
people were using kind of

241
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,598
you know customers were figuring out on

242
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,638
their own there was r d happening in the

243
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,159
company

244
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,720
and then to take those ideas and really

245
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,120
expand them into

246
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,840
you know commercial settings or or just

247
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,840
really easily

248
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,598
very modular easy to replicate systems

249
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,359
for the home growers that can easily

250
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,158
expand into a large like a medium system

251
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,200
to a very large system

252
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:34,718
and then

253
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,039
from there we've kind of really branched

254
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,440
off the last few years in irrigation and

255
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,038
uh we're doing big ag projects now you

256
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,200
know hundred acre farms that sort of

257
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,958
thing uh we're we're not using blue mats

258
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,399
for those we're more traditional drip

259
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,958
irrigation or

260
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,200
even some high powered overhead watering

261
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,159
in certain circumstances but

262
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,320
yes and

263
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,879
it's been a real journey of learning and

264
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,240
understanding and

265
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,039
kind of coming to know the whole

266
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,839
irrigation industry and world

267
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,039
for

268
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,680
you know

269
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,199
the last couple decades

270
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,719
yeah i mean just speaking with you in

271
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,320
person i could tell that you have a ton

272
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,320
of knowledge in regards to it it's like

273
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,839
clearly a passion for you and the way

274
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,760
you explain it just makes things fun

275
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,839
like the way you get to design different

276
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,319
ways to do it it just sounds so fun to

277
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,160
me yeah yeah there's lots of ways to do

278
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,000
different things and it's all it's all

279
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,079
about finding the most simple you know

280
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,879
cheapest way to do things and

281
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,440
um

282
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,480
yeah that's it's a it's a fun puzzle

283
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,800
yep

284
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,480
so let's talk about grill pots first

285
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,639
before we actually dive into the

286
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,560
different sizes right so plastic grow

287
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,958
pots versus fabric grill pots can you

288
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,079
talk to us like specifically how it

289
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:47,039
impacts in regards to irrigation yeah um

290
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,720
there's not a lot of difference so

291
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,439
you know most of most of the work we do

292
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,600
with blue mats and um is is in

293
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,680
containers right so we're like you said

294
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,519
we're in you know round pots

295
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,278
uh plastic pots nursery pots that kind

296
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,200
of stuff or fabric pots

297
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,879
um and then also in all kinds of

298
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,120
different raised beds that's a real

299
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,958
common you know container growing for

300
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,240
indoor gardening or

301
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:12,239
greenhouse gardening and stuff like that

302
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,240
people doing large raised beds um

303
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,360
there's not there's not a big well

304
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,519
if we're just if we looked at the

305
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,200
round pots kind of thing you know that's

306
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,720
that's one where there's a lot of

307
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,240
plastic pots in play there's a lot of

308
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,839
fabric pots in play

309
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,000
um

310
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,920
you know the the there's a there's the

311
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,399
product uh grassroots you know the

312
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:36,240
grassroots living soil products i'm kind

313
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,200
of a pretty good proponent of those

314
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,959
they're a

315
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,278
they're a fabric pot with a

316
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:44,078
non-permeable liner that you know that's

317
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,519
about eight or ten inches deep

318
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,599
so it gives a

319
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,320
like non-breathable

320
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,159
uh

321
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,680
layer on the upper part of it you know

322
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:55,439
so one of the big problems we see with

323
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:58,879
irrigating um fabric pots in general is

324
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,200
they dry out kind of in an uneven way

325
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,360
the edges like the couple inches near

326
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,600
the edge of the of the fabric

327
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,959
tend to dry out much faster than the

328
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,839
rest of the soil mass

329
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,159
so

330
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,200
uh roots tend not to colonize that outer

331
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,759
edge

332
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,839
as densely as as they would in even in a

333
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,439
plastic pot where moisture is able to be

334
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,560
held right up to the edge

335
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,920
now

336
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,599
fabric pots are actually but they're

337
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,360
also very handy right they're like light

338
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,159
weight you can ship them really easily

339
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,600
they're

340
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,838
you can kind of reuse them pretty well

341
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,200
and so that's again that's we come back

342
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,000
to those

343
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,519
grassroots pots i really like those for

344
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,360
being able to hold moisture right up to

345
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,399
the edge of the pot um and but not uh

346
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,759
but still have kind of a lot of

347
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,278
convenience of a fabric potter

348
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:44,879
particularly in the fabric raised beds

349
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,320
when we see those because they're they

350
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,360
can do big ones and

351
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,160
you know set them up really quickly

352
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,839
without a bunch of carpentry um

353
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,919
yeah so really i guess the the thing to

354
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,720
think about is

355
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,639
you know if we're in a raised bed or

356
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,399
sorry in a fabric pot situation that

357
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,519
doesn't have that living soil liner we

358
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,679
want to bring

359
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,879
our water distribution whatever drippers

360
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,479
or emitters we want to bring them

361
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:07,759
further out towards the edge of the pot

362
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,360
generally

363
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:13,519
so that we can keep that edge uh

364
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,600
more consistently uh

365
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,000
hydrated

366
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,959
but but really i mean not not a ton of

367
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,399
difference

368
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,359
um as far as how we're gonna how we're

369
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,639
gonna irrigate like if we're looking at

370
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,320
a five gallon pot it's really not gonna

371
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,519
be that much different between a a

372
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,399
plastic nursery pot or a fabric pot

373
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,480
okay that's good to know yeah now let's

374
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,039
let's go over some of these grill pot

375
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,480
sizes we'll start with just a one gallon

376
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,159
pot right so we have folks that are

377
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,320
using just one gallon pots maybe they

378
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,240
just have one plant in one pot

379
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,240
yeah what would you say the optimal way

380
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,079
to to irrigate that would be would it be

381
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,680
like a blue mac classic and then what if

382
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,599
they were to have like multiple one

383
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,479
gallon pots so just an individual one

384
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,440
versus multiple ones right

385
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,200
well

386
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,720
i think um in order to answer that i

387
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,800
just want to explain blue mats a little

388
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,320
bit sure and what they are and how they

389
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,078
work yeah so

390
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,839
what what they are is they're they're

391
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,359
moisture sensing valves

392
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,720
and you know i have one here i just

393
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,560
pulled it out of a plant so it's got

394
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,920
some dirt on it and stuff but you know

395
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:14,319
they they have a a screw cap here

396
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,519
so they they're empty

397
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,399
when you get them like this they have

398
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,440
this

399
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,440
silicon line it's a three millimeter

400
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,600
silicon line that goes through the top

401
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,360
they have this little brown dial

402
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,200
um on the top as well and that kind of

403
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,639
helps you adjust adjust moisture content

404
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,399
but essentially what you do with these

405
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,200
is you fill them with water

406
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,958
there's a little process for that

407
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,600
and seal them so now they have a sealed

408
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,359
uh there's a sealed cone full of water

409
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,040
and then this whole cone

410
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,879
is buried in the soil um right up to the

411
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,799
you know so that the ceramic tip the

412
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:50,000
ceramic tip of the cone is completely

413
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:52,159
buried and seated snugly into the soil

414
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,679
and and what happens actually is we so

415
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:58,399
we charge one end of this line um

416
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,319
with a constant pressure so one end of

417
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,120
this this water line will be a constant

418
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,560
uh

419
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,159
anywhere between about 2 and 15 psi is

420
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,119
the range we want to work in

421
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:12,240
and that's 24 hours a day we have a

422
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,759
pressurized line all the way up to

423
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,440
to the point where the where the tube

424
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,278
passes through the carrot

425
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,279
and

426
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,958
because the carrot's also a valve and

427
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,159
it's controlled by the soil moisture so

428
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,479
as the soil

429
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,480
moisture dries out it dries out this

430
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,480
ceramic tip just a bit and that pulls

431
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,959
some of the water that's inside down

432
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,879
into the ceramic itself which creates a

433
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,078
negative hydrostatic pressure negative

434
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,480
water pressure

435
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,239
inside the cone and that pulls against

436
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,440
the little membrane here which opens a

437
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,198
valve

438
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,480
in the top and allows water to flow

439
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,799
through that tube

440
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,959
and then drip out the other end of that

441
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,000
tube and you can either have that drip

442
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,439
out

443
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,120
directly uh

444
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,800
directly out of this tube into the pot

445
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,839
or through a series of distribution

446
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,240
drippers

447
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,639
or we have a really cool soaker hose

448
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,959
material

449
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,720
called blue soak it's a it's made out of

450
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,278
medical grade tyvek

451
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,120
it's it's really pretty durable

452
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,039
if you treat it right and

453
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,198
it gives very very even slow water

454
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:13,278
distribution so we can do up to a couple

455
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:15,599
hundred feet of that downstream of one

456
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,919
of these

457
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,879
so to answer your question um

458
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:23,039
about the best way to irrigate you know

459
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,679
a one gallon pot um

460
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,879
the other type of

461
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,278
blue matte product there is you

462
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,838
mentioned is the classic um

463
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,759
i have some here kind of just in my in

464
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,560
the plants here in my office

465
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,320
and

466
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,638
really what these are

467
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,240
let's see here

468
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,839
is uh these are a little different

469
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,198
if you can see this here

470
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,800
these guys are they just have a a

471
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,879
a hose connected right to the top but

472
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:53,359
doesn't pass through and one end of this

473
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,278
tube has like a weight a weight on it

474
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,079
and that weighted tube just gets dropped

475
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:00,240
into a pitcher of water and then the

476
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,799
cone itself gets buried in the soil here

477
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,039
and it actually just siphons water up

478
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,879
from the

479
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,719
from the from the pitcher of water into

480
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,240
there and it's kind of an even flow rate

481
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,240
so if you're doing a lot of small plants

482
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,320
like you know one gallon size plants one

483
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,159
of those classics would work

484
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,560
i know people who want to do

485
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,399
they're doing a lot of uh

486
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,078
clone propagation for whatever they're

487
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,679
growing they they might when they

488
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,359
transplant those clones into smaller

489
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:26,879
pots um

490
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,199
they'll use you know maybe you have a

491
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,360
whole bunch of them maybe get you know

492
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,879
you know 20 50 of these in small pots

493
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,959
having a whole bunch of carrots can work

494
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,159
for that

495
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,919
definitely done that i've used that

496
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:38,719
technique myself

497
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,559
um

498
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,480
but if you're if you're growing so

499
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,159
that's like would be like a veg like a

500
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,000
plant that's in a vegetative state if

501
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,399
you were flowering a plant out you might

502
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,078
want to do it in a

503
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,440
um

504
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,519
you might need a little bit more water

505
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,040
to do that so having the adjustable flow

506
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,360
rate that comes with the

507
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:00,319
with the troph blue mat is probably what

508
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,600
you want in a circumstance like that

509
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,920
you know things for that are geared

510
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,279
towards production the tropes work good

511
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,879
because they really

512
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,399
really meet the plants need wherever

513
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,120
they are

514
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,880
house plants the blue mat classic is an

515
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,038
excellent choice to

516
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,000
keep all your house plants nice evenly

517
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,759
watered and such

518
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
yeah a one gallon pot and it could go

519
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:23,599
anywhere from just one blue mat uh trope

520
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,959
two or one classic and that's all i

521
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,599
would do i wouldn't use any distribution

522
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,960
drippers or anything like that

523
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:33,279
okay and you mentioned a specific psi

524
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,000
that needs to be fed to the regular blue

525
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,599
mat carrot i don't want people to worry

526
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,119
about measuring that because it's just

527
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,038
really it's gravity fed right so you

528
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,479
just as long as it's above you know

529
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,798
hooked up to a reservoir and as long as

530
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,519
it's above the pots is that how high it

531
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:50,319
needs to be and then it will yeah

532
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,359
pretty much enough psi right so just to

533
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,558
give you guys a a little context

534
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,599
um

535
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:59,038
so you know psi it's a unit it means

536
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,798
pounds per square inch it's just a unit

537
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,038
of pressure

538
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:03,038
and

539
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:07,639
so if you have a container that's

540
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:09,679
so

541
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:14,160
2.31 feet

542
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,679
of vertical head right equals one psi

543
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,960
so the graph you know the gravity

544
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,200
pressure from 2.31 is is enough to isn't

545
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,480
is really enough uh one psi is enough

546
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,319
just to if you're just dripping right

547
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,079
out of a tube it's enough to run that

548
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,000
um and yeah it's absolutely right with

549
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,439
blue matte systems in general we can run

550
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,720
them a few different ways we can run

551
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,558
them

552
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,079
off of gravity so have a reservoir

553
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,000
that's you know on a shelf

554
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,199
and then that's providing the gravity is

555
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,200
just providing the pressure that

556
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,120
constant pressure

557
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,240
also we can have we have a pressure

558
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:46,798
reducer that just screws onto a hose bib

559
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,640
that's a 15 psi pressure reducer

560
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,319
uh you screw that on your hose bib and

561
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,640
then have the hose bib open and it's

562
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:56,480
just all your lines and your system will

563
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,840
then be charged at uh at 15 psi all the

564
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,400
time

565
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,918
and we also have we build pump kits

566
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,360
so if you have a reservoir that's on the

567
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,200
ground that maybe you want to mix

568
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:09,519
nutrients into or something like that

569
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,480
you can do that and then just pump out

570
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:14,798
of that and then we keep the lines uh

571
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,079
pressurized with a little pump that has

572
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:17,440
a pressure switch and a pressure

573
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,480
accumulator tank and then a pressure

574
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,000
reducer so we're able to uh

575
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,279
kind of you know maintain a constant

576
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,400
pressure just pulling out a reservoir

577
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,918
with a small

578
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,759
kind of like almost pre-assembled pump

579
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,320
kit that comes that we can that we offer

580
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,720
here at the sustainable village

581
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,839
those are kind of the three ways to

582
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,519
uh

583
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,879
provide that back end pressure either

584
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,319
gravity

585
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,960
a hose bib you know or or a pump kit

586
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,798
gotcha all mine are gravity fed i've had

587
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,558
the blue mac carrots go to three gallon

588
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:48,319
containers five gallon containers and

589
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,000
seven gallon containers actually run in

590
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:52,639
seven gallon containers right now for

591
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,279
three gallon grow pots let's move on to

592
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,880
that what's the optimal irrigation

593
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,480
method for it would you put one carrot

594
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,320
in there two carrots in there or what

595
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,240
would you do yeah you know again i would

596
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:04,000
stick with just the one carrot and and

597
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,679
no drippers probably i mean a three

598
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,400
three gallon pot like what is that like

599
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,640
a maybe an eight or nine inch diameter

600
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,759
pot or something like that um

601
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,120
that's um

602
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,079
it can be more than that i think it's

603
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,639
probably like

604
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,399
roughly 12 inches i would say okay yeah

605
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,080
so you know you're getting to a point

606
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,240
you know with all these like you know

607
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:23,199
smaller pots like pots under say 30

608
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,200
gallons

609
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,519
really one carat per pot is all you

610
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,240
really need i mean in the past people

611
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,720
have

612
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,400
wanted to do more and you can and

613
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,400
there's there's some

614
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,919
there's some advantages to adding adding

615
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,280
more carrots but

616
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,440
really first you know i just like want

617
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,678
to see things work well for people

618
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,759
and you know improve plant health

619
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:47,440
improve yield that sort of thing

620
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:49,759
and you know they can do that um

621
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,919
uh really well with just like one five

622
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,240
inch carrot and

623
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,320
and and a series of of distribution

624
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,240
drippers so um i don't

625
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,599
have any sitting right here but um

626
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,679
basically what we can do is with this

627
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,119
three inch tubing we can connect these

628
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,400
little distribution drippers that just

629
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,158
go in line

630
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,159
and make it make a chain of them

631
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,759
they're different than like a drip

632
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,200
emitter like a pressure compensating

633
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,759
drip emitter but there's but they're

634
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,440
similar in their idea

635
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:18,960
so you could have like

636
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,080
the carrot and then when the carrot

637
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,079
opens and it waters and it turns on

638
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:26,079
it drips in like you know

639
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,038
two places or three places or five

640
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,079
places

641
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:29,200
so

642
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,199
you know

643
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,360
going going up from

644
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,600
the three gallon five gallon you know

645
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,038
five gallon pot

646
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,798
um

647
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:40,079
or even a three

648
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,158
you know i would i would go with like

649
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,519
probably a carrot and then

650
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,039
if you want to do it cheap and easy you

651
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,440
can just do one you just have it drip

652
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:49,200
right out but if you want that nice even

653
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,798
watering coverage and you know

654
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,960
maintaining that upper

655
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:55,599
level of soil very very moist and

656
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,519
consistent you know three drippers is is

657
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:58,719
a good way to go

658
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:00,240
and we

659
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,240
mount those drippers on little stakes so

660
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,279
they sit up above the soil they kind of

661
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,440
drip down on the soil and

662
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,519
yeah i don't know if anybody's

663
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,600
there's a lot of like

664
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,599
we get these like root porn pictures

665
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,599
people send us all the time where

666
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,599
they'll be like a dripper it's like you

667
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,359
know maybe three inches above the stake

668
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,599
and then and the plants are just like

669
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,639
have built a giant mound of roots and

670
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:24,959
they're kind of

671
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,038
just you know tentacling their way up to

672
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,558
the dripper oh yeah i've seen that

673
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:29,839
people's drippers haven't gotten clogged

674
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:30,879
before that way right oh yeah well

675
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:32,158
that's when we started putting them on

676
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,360
the stakes because we would lay them on

677
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,440
the soil

678
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,439
and the roots would just kind of go into

679
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,679
them and just get all up in there so we

680
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,120
need to we need to keep them away from

681
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,919
the hungry plants

682
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,079
um

683
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,600
a little bit there to

684
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,839
but yeah that's that's pretty cool to

685
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,279
see that kind of action it re

686
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:51,119
you know

687
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,279
it really speaks to the kind of

688
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,038
sensitivity with the blue mat systems

689
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,240
because

690
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,400
you know with these with these plants

691
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,679
like you say we're growing a plant

692
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,038
indoors for

693
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,720
you know three months or something like

694
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,319
that

695
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,000
and at the end of that three-month

696
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,240
growing cycle i might i'll pull the

697
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,839
carrot out and look in the hole and the

698
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,319
hole is nothing but

699
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,798
it's just white it's all white roots

700
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:17,519
so that so after a while the plant grows

701
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,639
its roots all around the ceramic cone

702
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:20,558
and there's not actually any soil

703
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,120
touching it anymore

704
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:26,720
instead it's just it's just uh root tips

705
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:28,879
have have grasped this this valve

706
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,880
and and really then the plant is the one

707
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,559
that's operating the control because i

708
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,440
mean you the you know the root exudates

709
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:37,279
they can they basically create negative

710
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,120
pressure fields and pull

711
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:40,158
you know material in from the soil and

712
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,639
they're able to do this they can

713
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,799
actually exert negative pressure um

714
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,720
against that so the what's happening is

715
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,720
the plants is going and grabbing the

716
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,558
valve the water control valve and now

717
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,240
the plant's in control of how it gets

718
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,558
watered and when it gets watered

719
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,079
um so it's physically turning the water

720
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,240
valve on and off whenever it wants a

721
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,480
drink

722
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,359
um so that that's pretty cool

723
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,360
i think

724
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,959
that is pretty cool yeah

725
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,199
i want to talk about some other auto

726
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,720
watering options as well you know folks

727
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,159
that are watching this we we've been

728
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,440
introduced to blue mats right you know

729
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,960
you work for sustainable village you

730
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,278
don't want people calling this out as an

731
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,200
hour long infomercial

732
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,720
there are other options out there can

733
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,558
you kind of just talk to us about like

734
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,558
how they work for example the auto pot

735
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:24,960
system that's something i've had before

736
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:27,278
where you know it's it's it's down below

737
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,038
drip irrigation systems pump systems can

738
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:31,359
you just talk about like some of the

739
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:32,879
other options out there

740
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:34,319
um i don't know too much about the auto

741
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,559
pots i've never used them personally

742
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:38,558
they're kind of like a like a product

743
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:42,158
and i know you have to buy like special

744
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,759
pots and special trays and yeah but i

745
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,919
think they basically there's like a

746
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,000
water tray at the bottom that's filled

747
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,720
by a little float valve and then there's

748
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,480
like a wicking action that happens um

749
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,400
exactly well i've heard people have good

750
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,640
luck with them i know that they

751
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,440
yeah i think one of the

752
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,880
uh

753
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,360
just one of the downsides is you have to

754
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,240
use these these special containers that

755
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:05,918
they they have um but i've heard people

756
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,278
get really good results with them too

757
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,799
um

758
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,640
but then you know besides that like

759
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,400
there's hand watering of course

760
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,600
and you know that's not it's not that

761
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,519
bad like

762
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:17,278
there's nothing wrong with hand watering

763
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:20,400
so people have been watering plants for

764
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,440
a really really long time um

765
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,440
and you know especially we're just

766
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,440
talking about like home gardens and you

767
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,679
know backyard gardens or indoor gardens

768
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,519
and things like that smaller scale stuff

769
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,919
you can totally get away with hand

770
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,200
watering i'm sure we've all done that

771
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,360
at different times

772
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,519
done some hand watering i've done lots

773
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,199
of it

774
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,798
and you know there's the downfalls of

775
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,360
that it takes a lot of time

776
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,720
is the main thing and you're

777
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:48,158
putting a lot of

778
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,038
human subjectivity into it which um

779
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,919
isn't like always

780
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:54,480
you know

781
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,640
as high quality as it could be

782
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,558
um you know people make mistakes in my

783
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,120
point and and errors and

784
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,119
and uh forget to water and and then over

785
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:05,119
water you know over watering in general

786
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,158
is a really big problem it's probably

787
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:07,839
the worst

788
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,799
problem um

789
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:10,959
that

790
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:13,519
you might have with uh

791
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,798
uh irrigation in general um you know

792
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:16,639
with like house plants it's like

793
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,480
something like 80 percent of all

794
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,759
problems that with house plants people

795
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,960
experience are

796
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:24,558
are over watering so um it makes sense

797
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,278
people like wanna they want their plants

798
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:29,278
to do well they think that like

799
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:30,720
uh you know water equals love for the

800
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,798
plants and so they're just like giving

801
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,960
lots of love you get lots of water but

802
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,480
it's too much um

803
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,600
they want just that right amount so that

804
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,079
your soil doesn't get

805
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,278
oversaturated

806
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,278
there's a lot of things you know there's

807
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:46,798
a lot of downsides that can happen when

808
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:48,319
when too much water is in the plant the

809
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,000
the

810
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,639
the root exits will seal up they won't

811
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,759
they won't absorb any more water

812
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,759
and that means they're not absorbing any

813
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:57,440
more nutrients at the same time

814
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,278
it can be really detrimental for the

815
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,600
soil health too as far as the

816
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:03,759
microorganisms in the soil if there's if

817
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,599
there's too much water and it can even

818
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,278
you know go on to create

819
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:08,959
different pathogens you know different

820
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:11,440
pests and as or as well as just like

821
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,960
anaerobic bacterial conditions

822
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,600
in the soil that you know generally want

823
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,600
to avoid

824
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:20,798
the other the big thing as far as

825
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:22,480
automated irrigation is drip irrigation

826
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:24,079
so you know

827
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,880
lots of people have used drip irrigation

828
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,278
and it's

829
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,200
there's tons of really amazing

830
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,359
um

831
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,640
applications for that it was

832
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:35,038
kind of started getting i think it was

833
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,520
developed in like late 50s early 60s in

834
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,879
israel they started coming out with it

835
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,119
and then a lot of those technologies

836
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,720
came to states in the 70s and

837
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:44,479
and since then it's really blown up in

838
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,720
this huge you know multi-billion dollar

839
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,038
global industry of

840
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,038
manufacturing irrigation parts uh drip

841
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:53,599
irrigation parts and those can look

842
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,440
anything you know from like the uh just

843
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,119
kind of basic drip emitters

844
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,960
uh that are like punched into half inch

845
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:03,839
poly tubing or

846
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,519
um a lot of people see you see uh

847
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,199
you know they'll connect in a lot of

848
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,038
indoor gardens you see these systems

849
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,319
where they'll be like a main line

850
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:12,798
and then there'll be some sort of

851
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:15,599
emitter with multiple lines coming off

852
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:17,038
of it and stakes that go into pots

853
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,038
you know those things

854
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,720
all those those systems definitely work

855
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:21,759
and really for like outdoor stuff if

856
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,919
you're doing anything outdoors just

857
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:27,119
doing standard drip irrigation

858
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,240
you know i did that for years

859
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:30,239
i mean it

860
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,319
if you're providing regular consistent

861
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,599
water it's not that's not too much you

862
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:35,759
know it's enough

863
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:37,839
um it's it's definitely better than

864
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:38,960
nothing than doing this to then doing

865
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,720
nothing at all

866
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,880
um you know you want to be sensitive to

867
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,399
environmental conditions so like

868
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,320
if you're on a timer and you get a bunch

869
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:47,519
of rain like

870
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:48,639
you got to turn the timer off or

871
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,240
whatever

872
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,880
if you don't have some sort of you know

873
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,919
moisture sensing control

874
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,640
that's going to

875
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,640
account for that

876
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,799
and then just adjusting flow rates as

877
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,398
plants get bigger and providing more

878
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:04,240
inputs but yeah just you know

879
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:06,000
traditional drip irrigation works really

880
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,079
good the problem the problem with it is

881
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,519
um

882
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,960
one it's not very sensitive it doesn't

883
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:14,240
have same sensitivities uh like it's

884
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,919
just gonna water the same amount every

885
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,200
day if it's on a timer

886
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,320
and then

887
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,519
at two

888
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:22,158
it can be a little tricky getting

889
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,158
uniform water distribution so you know

890
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,520
you have to size your pump with the flow

891
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,919
rates that you're putting out into the

892
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,519
system or your pump or your hose or you

893
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,120
know you have to have enough flow and

894
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:34,079
pressure to

895
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:36,719
operate the system in a uniform way

896
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,839
so you know again there's just some

897
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,798
some things that need to happen with

898
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:40,079
that

899
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:41,519
as far as planning that out and

900
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,599
designing it so

901
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,679
at home you know you can usually just do

902
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,278
stuff you know fine if you're doing your

903
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,120
home gardens

904
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:52,480
if you start to get on in scale at all

905
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:54,158
it's nice to have a designer come in and

906
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,000
design the system for you and do the

907
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,520
engineering behind it because those

908
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,679
systems do require some actual

909
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:01,278
engineering as far as

910
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,960
um

911
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:04,558
you know again understanding you know

912
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,880
things like friction loss and flow and

913
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:06,879
pressure

914
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:10,798
i don't know it kind of actually kind of

915
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,639
go all over the place here and we can

916
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,079
talk about little systems or big systems

917
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,038
but and there's there's different it's

918
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:18,079
like different strategies like different

919
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:19,679
different goals have different

920
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,119
strategies that's the main thing it's

921
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,640
like what are you growing

922
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,000
what you know what size container are

923
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,880
you in

924
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,640
what is your environment like and

925
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,880
you know taking that information

926
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,880
and

927
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:35,359
applying different strategies finding

928
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,879
the strategy or the technique that's

929
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,240
going to best match up what you're

930
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,240
trying to achieve

931
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,359
is that's kind of what we do over here

932
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,000
but like that anybody can do it too

933
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:48,398
you just need to do a little homework

934
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,240
gotcha yeah i can see how those all the

935
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:52,158
variables would certainly impact it

936
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,599
right let's get into five gallon grill

937
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,960
pots i think you touched on five gallon

938
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:57,199
grill pot when we talked about the three

939
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,038
gallon grill pod was it one carrot i

940
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,240
think you mentioned on that or you could

941
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,079
do like

942
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,919
the one carrot but have it come out in

943
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,480
several different areas so you get more

944
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,320
distribution across that yeah you know i

945
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,599
think um

946
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,158
we i you know i like to think about

947
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:13,678
things like uh good better best you know

948
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,278
a lot of times like what's the what's

949
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,278
the economy version what's the mid-range

950
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:19,119
version what's the deluxe version

951
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,798
and you know for a five gallon pot it's

952
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:22,639
pretty much you know just have one

953
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:24,398
dripper point would be your real base

954
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,159
level economy it keeps the plant alive

955
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:27,839
keeps it pretty healthy and maybe it's

956
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,840
not in there for the whole life of the

957
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,678
plant maybe it's just for like a you

958
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:32,798
know a period of vegetative growth and

959
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,880
then you're going to transplant into

960
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:36,558
something larger

961
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,480
but if it's if it's that's it's forever

962
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,000
home or whatever like i would go you

963
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,000
know three or five drippers just

964
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,599
depending on what you know how much

965
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,960
coverage you want to do

966
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:47,038
and really like how many plants you're

967
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,159
going with because a lot of this stuff

968
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,558
it's just it's all about like

969
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,159
scalability so

970
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,079
if you've got six plants at home you can

971
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,080
really just like you got why not go

972
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,960
deluxe like you're gonna have these six

973
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:00,079
really lovely big plants

974
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,399
and they're just for you and your

975
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:05,038
friends or whatever and but if you're

976
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:07,038
trying to if you've got 500 5 gallon

977
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:08,960
pots you know it's

978
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:10,480
it's maybe you don't need quite the

979
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,000
deluxe version on every one of them you

980
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,038
can do something a little bit more

981
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,798
commercial

982
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:16,879
economic that kind of thing

983
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:19,440
do you have a recommendation for like

984
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,360
reservoir size per container or

985
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,558
something like that like i was running

986
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:24,558
three of them

987
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:26,000
and i had this massive reservoir it was

988
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:28,480
sent to me it was like it was kind of a

989
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,159
little silly having like a 64 gallon

990
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,319
reservoir something crazy like that

991
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,840
actually i think it was like a 32 gallon

992
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:36,798
reservoir but like

993
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:38,639
i only needed like five seven five to

994
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:41,119
seven gallons because off of like three

995
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,320
plants and three gallon containers yeah

996
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,319
it like a general recommendation for

997
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:46,319
like reservoir size

998
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:47,599
yeah it really depends on so many

999
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:48,558
different factors a lot of it has to do

1000
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:51,278
with like how many plants are you

1001
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:53,599
watering and like how big are the plants

1002
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:56,640
um and what size containers they are so

1003
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:57,599
with like five gallon pots

1004
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,600
you know

1005
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:01,439
if if you're growing plants in there

1006
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,678
stay in an indoor environment that's you

1007
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,600
know warm you know it's in the high 70s

1008
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,798
or something like that or whatever

1009
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:08,398
um

1010
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:09,359
and there's a lot of transpiration what

1011
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:10,879
not

1012
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:12,398
you know you might you might have a big

1013
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,399
plant in there

1014
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:16,079
you could figure that it could go up to

1015
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:17,599
a half gallon a day

1016
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,798
of water could be used in that five

1017
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,639
gallon pot

1018
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:22,720
so that's kind of one way to think about

1019
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,720
it if you're relying purely on like a

1020
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,480
gravity fed situation

1021
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,480
um

1022
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,880
which works again works great for that

1023
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,679
like 6 to 12 plant kind of thing

1024
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,200
um

1025
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,200
and then pressurized systems tend to

1026
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,798
work a little better for for larger

1027
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,000
systems

1028
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:39,599
and by pressurized i mean like with a

1029
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,119
hose bib or a pump

1030
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:42,240
um

1031
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,000
the uh

1032
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,079
yeah as far as flow rate and container

1033
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,359
size you know it's all about how often

1034
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,519
do you want to refill it so if i had a

1035
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,719
32g i would i mean i like having a big

1036
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,720
reservoir

1037
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,240
um

1038
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,960
and

1039
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,359
you know because you don't have to

1040
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,159
refill it as often it's really the main

1041
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:59,918
thing

1042
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,600
um and a lot or you can have a small

1043
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,960
reservoir and you can have a float valve

1044
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:04,959
on it so you know

1045
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:08,639
as soon as you use some of that water

1046
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,838
the flow valve kicks on and keeps itself

1047
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,039
topped off

1048
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:12,000
um

1049
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:13,759
because it's another thing to think

1050
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,838
about when using blue mats and

1051
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,839
and gravity is

1052
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,159
like if you have a big reservoir it's

1053
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:21,599
tall like say it's like five feet tall

1054
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,480
when that thing's full it's going to

1055
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,200
have

1056
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,679
you know a couple psi more than when

1057
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:30,078
it's almost empty of pressure and these

1058
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,159
the carrots are set to like a relative

1059
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,240
pressure sensing so they're

1060
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,919
you you can get some inconsistency if

1061
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,239
you have a very tall reservoir that you

1062
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,838
fluctuate from full to empty

1063
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,358
um if you do have a larger reservoir we

1064
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:42,960
always recommend when people are setting

1065
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:44,319
the carrots they fill the reservoir like

1066
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,159
halfway

1067
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,359
and then they set it

1068
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,280
and then fill it the rest of the way so

1069
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:50,799
you're kind of getting that median uh

1070
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,200
pressure that you're going to find is

1071
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,000
when when you're dialing in the carrots

1072
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,838
um

1073
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,519
but yeah i like having them i like this

1074
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:59,440
i like having a small one on some sort

1075
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:01,199
of uh

1076
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,639
float valve and that float valve the

1077
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,919
supply line that float valve doesn't

1078
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:05,838
even have to be on all the time you can

1079
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,079
have that on a timer too

1080
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:10,239
for instance so like say you had just a

1081
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,079
five gallon bucket as your reservoir and

1082
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,319
you had a bunch of plants maybe a couple

1083
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,480
times a day the timer kicks like a timer

1084
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,359
kicks on and charges the water line up

1085
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,760
to that

1086
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:21,920
float valve and then the float valve you

1087
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,760
know is if it's open it oh it's open and

1088
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,200
it fills and shuts off

1089
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,040
and then it and then the timer turns off

1090
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:29,039
and it depressurizes and that way you

1091
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:30,639
don't have a pressurized line like you

1092
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,079
know running through your house or

1093
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:33,358
whatever all the time because that can

1094
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,960
be a little

1095
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:36,880
um

1096
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,720
you know scary or whatever just a little

1097
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,838
there's a little risk having pressurized

1098
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,838
water lines inside

1099
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:45,679
i hear you and you mentioned the five

1100
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,358
gallon bucket i was going to say that

1101
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,440
you know for most homegrown applications

1102
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:51,039
people who are growing maybe maybe six

1103
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,880
plants or less can get away with a

1104
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:55,599
five-gallon bucket right typically

1105
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,440
you'll put you know four you know top it

1106
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,200
off to five gallons of water in there

1107
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,559
and it's going to take a little while

1108
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,159
for them to eat through it so you could

1109
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,639
just go in there every day and just add

1110
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:07,519
in water if needed you know so i

1111
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:10,960
currently have a like i bought a trash

1112
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:13,039
bin and it's like a 14 gallon trash bin

1113
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,720
and i use that and i don't fill it up

1114
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:17,119
all the way you know i have it filled up

1115
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:18,959
probably maybe five gallons at a time so

1116
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,960
i can potentially downgrade for for my

1117
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,199
particular scenario but certainly i feel

1118
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,280
like folks can get away with running you

1119
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:27,279
know carrots right to a five gallon

1120
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,960
bucket do you sell the reservoir too or

1121
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,760
do you just sell the piece that kind of

1122
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,838
connects to it right uh we sell a lot of

1123
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,440
buckets so like one of our more popular

1124
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:36,320
products is just it's like our bucket

1125
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,400
kits

1126
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,960
so it'll be it'll be a reservoir with

1127
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,639
the bulkheads drilled into it and then

1128
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,320
like packed inside of it you know it's

1129
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:46,239
like enough for like six or twelve

1130
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,160
plants and all the tubing and supply

1131
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:49,358
line and that sort of thing and

1132
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:51,039
um

1133
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:53,039
so that like that whole kit like a

1134
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:54,960
bucket with all the components it's like

1135
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,800
a standalone kit that's really nice for

1136
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,800
someone that wants to test out blue mats

1137
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,680
or something like that and try them out

1138
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,200
um we sell those we we also sell some

1139
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,039
other reservoirs but

1140
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:08,559
not once we get i don't do a lot of the

1141
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:09,759
big large ones you kind of need like a

1142
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,320
anyways we're just not really set up to

1143
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,480
sell really large uh reservoirs we have

1144
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,440
some cool stackable ones that go

1145
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,960
anywhere from like 45 to 300 gallons but

1146
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,720
yeah i don't get i don't get into like

1147
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,639
the cis turns the you know multi

1148
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:24,559
thousand gallon cis turns and stuff like

1149
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:27,118
that one you know one of the things we

1150
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:28,799
see people use all the time is just the

1151
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,838
the ibc tote

1152
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,760
um

1153
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,599
like uh

1154
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,119
it's i'm sure you've seen them they're

1155
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,119
they're on like a pallet like a pallet

1156
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,400
skid with a metal cage around it and

1157
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,920
they're about 275 gallons oh yeah super

1158
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,559
common they're cheap like you can pretty

1159
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,400
much find those in any like town city in

1160
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:48,639
america like they have them

1161
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,800
you can buy them for

1162
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:54,559
you know 150 bucks or something and uh

1163
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,039
those make pretty good you know they're

1164
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:58,159
cheap easy water reservoirs

1165
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:59,838
you want to make sure you get a food

1166
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,960
grade or something one that was had like

1167
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:04,719
food grade materials in it and not like

1168
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,599
motor oil or something but

1169
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:07,679
um

1170
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,800
yeah that's uh

1171
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:10,960
those are those are great easy

1172
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,160
reservoirs for larger systems or you can

1173
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,358
if you if they're sitting on the ground

1174
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:17,838
you can pump out of them as well

1175
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,358
i currently have seven gallon pots

1176
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:22,559
that's what we'll talk about next i have

1177
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:23,920
two carrots going in each one so you've

1178
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:25,358
got the the plant in the middle right

1179
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,440
the stock in the middle and then a

1180
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,679
carrot on each side do you think that is

1181
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,800
sufficient for that or would you go a

1182
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:34,719
different route to irrigation on a seven

1183
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,280
gallon or what no i mean like i said

1184
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:39,039
like you one carat is probably fine this

1185
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,240
is fine two is nice

1186
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:41,679
and we have different size there's

1187
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:44,078
different size carrots too right there's

1188
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:46,960
a that was this is a five inch here but

1189
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,640
i but i also have a nine inch carrot

1190
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,000
so we can measure different soil depths

1191
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,159
so a lot of times when we're using

1192
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,679
multiple carrots in a container we're

1193
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:55,440
using different size ones so we're

1194
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:56,639
measuring different soil

1195
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,240
levels

1196
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,400
so if one one of those moisture levels

1197
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:02,639
dries out there's you know waters

1198
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,039
applied to the plant

1199
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,319
so yeah i know yeah yeah you know

1200
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:08,800
there's no

1201
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,240
like there's not a wrong way or a right

1202
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,839
way to do stuff there's there's like

1203
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:15,199
good ideas and that work you know more

1204
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:16,559
efficiently there's there's other ideas

1205
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:18,239
that are

1206
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:19,920
given even like give a little bit more

1207
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,519
edge on performance but might be a

1208
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,280
little more complicated

1209
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:24,960
um

1210
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,040
the

1211
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,480
yeah i guess the way i look at things i

1212
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:30,960
tend to look at things on like a larger

1213
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,199
scale a lot of the time so i want to

1214
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,720
i want things i don't like to over build

1215
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:35,919
the systems we design i want them to

1216
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:38,639
just the work

1217
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,119
like just right and

1218
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,639
and to approach it more

1219
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,640
so you know there's this whole market of

1220
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:46,960
like indoor you know

1221
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:48,799
medicinal plant cultivation

1222
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,639
then then there's usually everything's

1223
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,960
expensive it goes along with that right

1224
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:55,358
like the fertilizer might if you're

1225
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,400
using that same fertilizer to like grow

1226
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:59,119
vegetables

1227
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,358
versus medicinal plants you might

1228
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,358
uh

1229
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:05,279
it's going to be like drastically more

1230
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:07,519
expensive and there's like it's like a

1231
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,960
tax that's put on there so

1232
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:10,719
that's the case for a lot of the big

1233
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,920
commercial drip irrigation systems that

1234
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,199
we see i see people putting in and

1235
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,480
they're over built they're overly

1236
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,960
complicated

1237
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,358
and if we take the um

1238
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,880
principles and kind of like ethos of how

1239
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:26,239
to irrigate at an ag level like if you

1240
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,000
think you're like imagine you're like a

1241
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:30,879
beet farmer or something like your

1242
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,318
margin is super super tight so it really

1243
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,440
makes a lot of you have to just do

1244
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:35,519
things just

1245
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,838
not as cheaply as possible but like as

1246
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,280
efficiently and economically as possible

1247
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:41,199
and there's ways to take those

1248
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,040
principles and irrigate

1249
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:46,159
you know the indoor their common indoor

1250
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,279
plants that get cultivated at scale uh

1251
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:50,078
and

1252
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,839
um and do it like much more efficiently

1253
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,119
and

1254
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:55,199
economically if you use those kind of ag

1255
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,880
principles for irrigation

1256
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:58,639
instead of like

1257
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,280
you know specialized like

1258
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:03,358
kind of lots of lots of bells and

1259
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,599
whistles hydroponics kind of style

1260
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,199
irrigation

1261
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,680
i think one of the main concerns for

1262
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,199
folks is the medium drying out

1263
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:12,480
and you know that's one thing when

1264
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:14,318
you're growing organically you need to

1265
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,000
have a moist medium at all times or else

1266
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:16,800
the microbes aren't going to be active

1267
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,119
and

1268
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,240
my viewers hear me say this all the time

1269
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,599
the amendments aren't going to get

1270
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:23,118
broken down and you could run into

1271
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,640
deficiencies

1272
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,240
i feel like i'm kind of running into a

1273
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:28,799
problem right now having two drippers in

1274
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:31,118
a seven gallon the top layer still kind

1275
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,800
of isn't moist at all times even you

1276
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,480
know when you top dress in organic

1277
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,800
nutrients the area right where the

1278
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,318
dripper is is moist you can clearly see

1279
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,240
it but like

1280
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:44,239
behind the dripper is like dry and

1281
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:45,838
you know how does how do is there a

1282
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:47,279
better way to go about it you know what

1283
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:48,400
i mean should i have a soaker hose in

1284
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,760
there for example

1285
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,358
in a seven gallon in order to help

1286
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,040
ensure moisture i don't like to use that

1287
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:55,039
soaker hose until

1288
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:57,519
maybe like a 15 gallon pot or something

1289
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:59,679
like that okay um it just

1290
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:00,559
it tends to

1291
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:02,159
you're gonna be better off with the

1292
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:04,880
drippers

1293
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:06,399
you know to your point about

1294
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,800
using

1295
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,880
dry organic nutrients or dry nutrients

1296
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,760
at all

1297
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,039
there's a technique we like to use

1298
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,520
sometimes

1299
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:19,119
we call it the nutrient well and

1300
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,119
you know the idea being if you have a

1301
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,559
dripper and your carrots controlling a

1302
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,000
series of dripper

1303
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:25,759
um you know some of them might drip

1304
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,880
right in the soil but

1305
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,760
they're going to be suspended over the

1306
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,400
soil and they're going to be dripping

1307
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,000
out of the onto the soil so if you had a

1308
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,480
dry amendment one thing you can do is

1309
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,358
actually carve out like a little hole

1310
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,559
um

1311
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:38,318
and

1312
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:40,880
fill that with like don't you know with

1313
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:44,400
a with the pure nutri like dry nutrient

1314
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,240
mix or something like that um you know i

1315
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,079
used to still use this stuff growilla a

1316
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:49,439
lot i liked that for a while but it's

1317
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,039
like you know there's there's lots of dr

1318
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,559
earth's a big one it's really similar

1319
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:54,400
kind of one i've been using but there's

1320
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:55,838
uh you know they're just like mixes of

1321
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,280
all these like really good

1322
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:58,799
bone meal and blood meal and now you

1323
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,880
know with alpha and all kinds of cool

1324
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,400
stuff they and and

1325
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,920
if you have if you have this kind of

1326
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,920
well of that dense nutrients and you

1327
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,280
have a dripper right on top of it

1328
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,880
you're gonna you're gonna every time it

1329
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,119
waters it's gonna drip right on that

1330
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,400
nutrient well and kind of just you know

1331
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,318
it's almost like

1332
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,920
not really time release but kind of it's

1333
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:17,679
sort of every time it waters you're

1334
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,680
getting this this little bit of a flush

1335
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,519
into that nutrients and you might not

1336
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,838
want that

1337
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,440
for um every spot but on a seven gallon

1338
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:26,559
pot you're still a relatively small

1339
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,599
container

1340
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:29,279
and

1341
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,359
you know the plant's going to be able to

1342
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,280
uptake a lot of those nutrients your

1343
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:34,880
point about soil drying out and

1344
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,000
nutrients not being available i mean

1345
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,519
that is

1346
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,440
that's like almost the most important

1347
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:42,719
thing around

1348
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,000
thinking about how to irrigate plants um

1349
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:46,000
and

1350
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,400
yeah it all has to do with that

1351
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,440
that that that ecosystem is created in

1352
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,440
the soil

1353
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,039
um all those microorganisms if it gets

1354
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,159
too dry they're going to go dormant if

1355
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:56,719
it gets too wet they're going to go

1356
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:58,078
dormant but if you're able to hold them

1357
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:00,799
in that

1358
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,800
it's called hydro neutral zone like

1359
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,000
goldilocks zone right not too dry not

1360
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,000
too wet

1361
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,440
um

1362
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,440
they're they're not going to go dormant

1363
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,559
as often and whatever their job is

1364
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,920
whether it's solubilizing phosphorus or

1365
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:15,759
fixing nitrogen or transferring

1366
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,119
nutrients or whatever like they're going

1367
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,800
to do that

1368
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,640
like 24 hours a day instead of

1369
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,359
you know only when the up you know when

1370
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:24,799
the

1371
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:27,838
when the soil moisture conditions are

1372
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,519
optimal for it so yeah i mean i really

1373
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:31,039
i'm glad you're telling your

1374
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:32,400
your listeners

1375
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:34,159
that um

1376
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,000
because it's very very true

1377
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:37,838
i'll have to try out the nutrient well

1378
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,440
method that you mentioned i mean i kind

1379
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:41,039
of did when i top dressed but the the

1380
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,679
problem is it's so much right like i'm

1381
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:44,880
using a cup of build a soil craft blend

1382
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:47,199
and like putting that into a seven

1383
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,119
gallon container and two spots plus worm

1384
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:51,039
castings it's like it's hard to keep it

1385
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,720
all in one area and i'm also afraid of

1386
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:54,559
like digging down in that area where the

1387
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:56,318
roots are already established to create

1388
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:58,239
that well so i don't know if the well is

1389
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:00,480
created like in the beginning when you

1390
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,598
first plant or what

1391
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,199
another thing you do if you're using

1392
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,640
blue mats is you can still topstress

1393
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:05,358
liquid inputs

1394
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,639
so

1395
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:08,239
you know if you have your blue mat

1396
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:10,480
system set up it's all dialed in it's

1397
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:12,959
maintained as moisture if you go through

1398
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,280
and either like mix up a liquid nutrient

1399
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,880
and pour it over the top or put a dry

1400
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,240
nutrient mix into the surface and kind

1401
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,160
of just scuff it in with your fingers

1402
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:22,719
just a little bit and then take you know

1403
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:24,078
your a wand or you know some water and

1404
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:26,239
water that in

1405
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,760
that's fine the blue mat itself is going

1406
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:30,479
to just turn off

1407
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,920
and it'll just stay off until the the

1408
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,519
soil moisture's dried down to that

1409
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,200
optimal level that you've you've set it

1410
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:37,199
to to maintain

1411
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:39,118
so um

1412
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:41,519
yeah i mean again like

1413
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,400
in in big like living soil

1414
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:44,079
you know

1415
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,519
grows that we we see there a lot of like

1416
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:49,280
raised beds right and with with those

1417
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:50,880
you know all this there's wonderful soil

1418
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,000
mixes and stuff and

1419
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,680
um

1420
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,960
but we will only run we'll only run

1421
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:57,199
water through the blue mats and if they

1422
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,440
want to top dress in inputs like a

1423
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:01,358
compost tea or something those come

1424
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,079
through the greenhouse like once a week

1425
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:05,759
or whatever and have like a nutrient vat

1426
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,839
mixed up somewhere a little day tank you

1427
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,200
know day mix tank put whatever they want

1428
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:11,679
to put in there you know

1429
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:13,679
and a small sump pump and a garden hose

1430
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:16,159
and a wand and just you know top water

1431
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:18,078
in whatever they want to feed it

1432
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:19,519
it's really not that much water going in

1433
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,960
generally so

1434
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:22,559
it doesn't really

1435
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,318
affect the moisture level it's only a

1436
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:26,159
few gallons generally you know per

1437
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:28,559
raised bed or whatever but that's sort

1438
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:29,358
of standard operating procedure for

1439
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:32,880
uh

1440
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:34,239
there's like more commercial living soil

1441
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,400
applications that are in raised beds

1442
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,679
they'll run just plain water through

1443
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,280
through the irrigation system or through

1444
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:40,719
the blue mats and then you prevent

1445
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,480
things from

1446
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,159
you know like building up like

1447
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,159
because you can run nutrients and liquid

1448
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:50,799
inputs through blue mats or drip

1449
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:53,279
irrigation um in general but you have to

1450
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,960
kind of account for

1451
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,400
like biofilm buildup or if you're

1452
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,480
running synthetic nutrients and you have

1453
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,440
like salt buildups mineral buildups

1454
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,920
um

1455
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,200
and uh and there's that's fine you just

1456
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,240
there's some products you can use to

1457
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:06,399
treat that

1458
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:08,559
and and break up the build up that's

1459
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,440
happening and flush the lines or you can

1460
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,159
use them in know kind of

1461
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,559
prophylactically as a

1462
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:15,838
throughout the growth cycle

1463
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:18,239
but um

1464
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:20,639
yeah okay so if you water in compost

1465
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:23,118
teas or sometimes i'll do a mix of like

1466
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:24,639
a microbial inoculant and then i'll

1467
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,079
water it in i shouldn't be taking them

1468
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:28,000
out or anything like that did the blue

1469
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,880
mask need to be recalibrated at any

1470
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,159
point

1471
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,519
only if you

1472
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:33,759
let the soil dry out really

1473
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:35,280
significantly so that it actually dries

1474
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,319
because if you get the soil really dry

1475
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:42,240
it'll it'll pull the moisture out here

1476
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:44,719
and once this inside of the carrot um

1477
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,479
loses enough water its ability to turn

1478
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:47,679
on and off that valve

1479
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,960
diminishes

1480
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:50,558
so then we

1481
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,240
then you can have errors like we call

1482
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,359
them runaways it's like it's like the

1483
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:54,959
main thing that goes wrong with blue

1484
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:56,318
mats is they'll over water sometimes

1485
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,480
because of

1486
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:00,079
there's some sort of

1487
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,599
issue and it's a very short list of like

1488
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,559
troubleshooting to figure out what that

1489
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,480
is

1490
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,640
but one of them could be if the carrot

1491
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,719
dries out there's a large air bubble in

1492
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:10,558
the top uh it won't doesn't have enough

1493
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,480
pressure to operate the valve and close

1494
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,359
it when it needs to

1495
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,559
yeah

1496
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:18,400
okay now what if your reservoir kind of

1497
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,800
dries out it drops all the way down to

1498
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,160
the level to where the you know the hose

1499
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,839
is connected to the reservoir the water

1500
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:26,799
level drops below that and it's no

1501
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:28,000
longer getting water to the carrots what

1502
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,000
will happen that the carrots will just

1503
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,599
dry out yeah just depends on how long

1504
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,838
that's going on for

1505
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,160
so if

1506
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:38,078
the you know if your reservoir goes dry

1507
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:40,239
and whatever it's like a day it's

1508
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,079
probably fine but if it's you know five

1509
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:43,759
days or something again it's all about

1510
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,480
just like you know

1511
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,680
you and you can check too like sometimes

1512
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,838
you know if your carrots buried in the

1513
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:51,358
soil and you and the soil's like really

1514
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:53,759
dry or something's going wrong like you

1515
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:55,119
know the water supply turned off somehow

1516
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,200
and you want to know you can always just

1517
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,880
like you take pull one carrot up and

1518
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:01,118
just sort of tip it upside down see if

1519
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,400
you see a big air bubble in it and if

1520
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,960
there's if there's a good-sized air

1521
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,358
bubble but not like uh

1522
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,720
you know but it's still it's still moist

1523
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:10,400
you know there's still some water in

1524
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:12,399
there you can really kind of get away

1525
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,920
with just having a bucket with you and

1526
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,680
and you don't have to re-soak it you can

1527
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,039
just unscrew it have a bucket stick both

1528
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:18,318
your hands under the water in the bucket

1529
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:20,480
and reseal it

1530
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:21,440
and then you know place it back in there

1531
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,159
you don't have to go through the whole

1532
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,720
like

1533
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:25,920
soaking process it just just to top off

1534
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:27,838
the carrot

1535
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,639
um

1536
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:32,639
so yeah okay that's good to know but no

1537
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:35,358
i mean really once you dial them in they

1538
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:37,199
should maintain for the for the full uh

1539
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:39,519
run yeah that's one thing i like about

1540
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:41,118
it is you kind of want to say set it

1541
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:43,679
forget it but set it just keep the

1542
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,280
reservoir full you know

1543
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:46,879
you know i've got all my kitchen gardens

1544
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,680
and stuff set up at home all my raised

1545
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,160
beds

1546
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:51,838
grow my produce and stuff and whatever

1547
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:54,078
else and it's like man up you know in

1548
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:55,838
may or june i'll go out there and turn

1549
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,440
on the whole irrigation system and like

1550
00:49:55,838 --> 00:49:58,880
go through and spend a day or two

1551
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,280
getting everything dialed in and fixed

1552
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,559
up and re-soaked the carrots and

1553
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,680
then it's like i don't touch it until

1554
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,280
like

1555
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:07,598
i start ripping it apart you know taking

1556
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,280
it down in october so

1557
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,838
that makes sense now there has been

1558
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:14,240
times where i got the proper moisture

1559
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:16,159
level that i felt right i actually water

1560
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:17,919
and then the next day is when i i add

1561
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:20,000
the blue mats in right

1562
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,000
that's typically what my plants seem to

1563
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,760
like it the most is to wait a day and

1564
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,239
then add them in but there has been

1565
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,480
times where i you know i i dial them in

1566
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:30,879
and then i come back 24 hours later and

1567
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,838
i see one of the drippers constantly

1568
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,240
dripping

1569
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:36,558
is that a problem or is it just working

1570
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:39,199
as normal i mean it's you know they take

1571
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:41,119
con they do take some tuning right

1572
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:43,439
generally once they're you can kind of

1573
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,880
you can do that and forget it thing like

1574
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,480
once you get them dialed in maybe it

1575
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,559
takes you like a week or so to get it

1576
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,400
dialed in from once you put it in or

1577
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,640
maybe even two weeks like for really

1578
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,039
nail it and then it's fine for the whole

1579
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:56,719
rest of the growth cycle and that gets

1580
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:58,159
faster and faster the more you use them

1581
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:00,639
too because

1582
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:02,399
you know once you get kind of adept at

1583
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:03,679
tuning them you can almost like

1584
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,599
feel the tension point when you're

1585
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:07,679
tightening them up

1586
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,960
that you want to maintain a mat but

1587
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:10,558
if you see something dripping and the

1588
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,559
soil is wet it's too wet you don't want

1589
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,640
it to wet i mean you should dial it back

1590
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,400
you know make the adjustment for sure

1591
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:17,759
okay good job no things can happen like

1592
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,119
they can get bumped

1593
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,880
um in different ways maybe you don't

1594
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:22,559
notice it but like you bump the pot or

1595
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,000
something like that and it

1596
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,760
hit maybe

1597
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,440
because that's something like if if if

1598
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,839
these carrots are buried

1599
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,039
and they get jostled and then like all

1600
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:32,639
of a sudden the

1601
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:34,079
they're not flush up against the soil

1602
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:36,159
the ceramic part if there's air up

1603
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,559
against the ceramic then the carrot

1604
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:40,558
reads as dry if it reads it is very very

1605
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,839
dry so then it's going to get the

1606
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,160
valve's going to open up and it's going

1607
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:47,440
to over water so if these things get

1608
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:49,838
like bumped a little bit sometimes

1609
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,838
they can they can cause that's like the

1610
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:52,960
other you know

1611
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:54,558
so there's a pretty short list of

1612
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,639
troubleshooting if you're seeing

1613
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:59,119
over watering and you know

1614
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:00,078
uh ones the air bubbles inside the other

1615
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,440
is like

1616
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,720
something happened to the carrot where

1617
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,639
like

1618
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:07,039
you know a person or a dog or a clumsy

1619
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:08,799
employee or somebody like

1620
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:10,719
hit it you know touched it in some way

1621
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,519
that made it over water

1622
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:13,679
okay

1623
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:15,838
speaking of problems is salt buildup

1624
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:17,919
ever a problem like particularly when

1625
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:19,599
using the synthetic fertilizer since

1626
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,838
with blue matter there is no runoff

1627
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,599
right so like is there do you recommend

1628
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,199
like a flush to happen or multiple

1629
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,318
flushes to happen throughout the grow

1630
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:28,719
when growing

1631
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:31,358
it's all filled up in the soil yeah yeah

1632
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:33,039
yeah um well sure uh

1633
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:34,000
obviously that's like a downside right

1634
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:36,400
of

1635
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,800
of the synthetic program but

1636
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,160
what we recommend is

1637
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,359
if if someone's doing like a straight

1638
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:44,879
like cocoa salt type grow right so

1639
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:46,639
they're just running synthetic nutrients

1640
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,480
into their their plants with some sort

1641
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:49,759
of soilless medium

1642
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,519
um

1643
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,359
uh kind of like the

1644
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:54,559
you know the traditional wisdom is you

1645
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:55,679
flush that at the end of the growth

1646
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,960
cycle

1647
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:01,598
you know to get a lot of that salt out

1648
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,599
and and additionally whenever you water

1649
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:05,119
you tend to water into a significant

1650
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,440
amount of runoff right so you water

1651
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:09,519
until there's x amount of runoff

1652
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,800
and that runoff is just those liquid

1653
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,239
nutrients you just

1654
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,079
bought at the growth store for a lot of

1655
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:15,039
money just going right down the drain

1656
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,559
but um

1657
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:17,920
so with the blue mats we don't see that

1658
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,920
drain to waste

1659
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,119
uh we don't see that runoff happening

1660
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,480
because everything that goes in the pot

1661
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,519
stays there

1662
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,159
and

1663
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:27,920
to account for that what we like to do

1664
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:30,078
is recommend that if you're if you're

1665
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,680
growing a synthetic program to take the

1666
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:33,039
dilution rates that you're

1667
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:34,480
using and are successful with and cut

1668
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:37,039
them in half

1669
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,639
and and use half as much nutrients of

1670
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:39,759
course the added benefit you know right

1671
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:41,039
off the bat is you're using half the

1672
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,480
nutrients but

1673
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:45,119
people are getting as good or better

1674
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,880
results by doing that with the blue mats

1675
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,800
and and honestly like we have a bunch of

1676
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,920
folks out there

1677
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,640
uh that just run coco and salt and like

1678
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,000
just

1679
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:56,159
crush it like

1680
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,280
they come back and they're like i just

1681
00:53:56,159 --> 00:54:01,440
didn't know we could grow like this

1682
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,480
another product i think we might start

1683
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,358
carrying this but we're not right at the

1684
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,039
moment

1685
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:06,960
i like it a lot though and i think it's

1686
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:09,199
an awesome component to work with the

1687
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,199
blue mats is this

1688
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:12,960
fertilizer product called beanstalk

1689
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,078
beanstalk ag if you

1690
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,920
heard about them there that's a

1691
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,640
synthetic it's a synthetic program too

1692
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,920
but

1693
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:20,159
it's like these little

1694
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,838
pellets they kind of look like

1695
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,358
like nerds or something like that

1696
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:24,960
actually

1697
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:26,239
yeah it's just sort of uh

1698
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,159
we were doing some r d but it's like

1699
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:30,078
these just little pellets

1700
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:32,879
and you mix that in with the soil and

1701
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:36,000
it's it's like a time release fertilizer

1702
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,760
but it's specifically designed

1703
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,760
to uh

1704
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,040
kind of like work with the growth cycles

1705
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,680
for

1706
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:45,838
you know uh the most common indoor

1707
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:47,358
medicinal plants that people grow

1708
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:48,480
and so

1709
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:50,239
um

1710
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,000
that works great with with blue mats

1711
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:54,000
like the the beanstalk does we've been

1712
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,199
doing some r d with it because we were

1713
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,039
thinking about actually carrying it

1714
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:59,919
which would be a big departure for us to

1715
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:01,519
carry a synthetic product we're really

1716
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,880
geared towards organic and

1717
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:04,719
sustainability and regenerative

1718
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,798
agriculture so

1719
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:08,480
but i just think it works so well that

1720
00:55:06,798 --> 00:55:11,358
it's worth

1721
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:13,599
you know promoting a little bit

1722
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:15,598
as far as the synthetic program i know

1723
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,599
there are some synthetics or some

1724
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,318
bottled nutrient lines for example that

1725
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:22,798
it could clog right clog things up so

1726
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:25,039
the solution to that is peck acid

1727
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:26,639
which is like uh

1728
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:29,358
drip clean this product called drip

1729
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:31,759
clean that's like super common

1730
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:33,358
just yeah using that like as directed on

1731
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,480
the bottles that'll take care of all

1732
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:36,798
those issues

1733
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,318
and keep it clean

1734
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:39,920
you know the distribution drippers is

1735
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:41,039
probably the weakest link in the blue

1736
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,358
mat system

1737
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:44,558
for nutrient buildup

1738
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:46,880
but

1739
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:49,359
so if you're doing a lot of

1740
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,280
plants of nutrients sometimes just like

1741
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:52,960
omit the distribution drippers and just

1742
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,119
drip right out of the tube

1743
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,440
uh is it

1744
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:59,280
a technique

1745
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,798
let's flip back into a few container

1746
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,640
sizes and then and then we'll wrap

1747
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:04,000
things up we covered all the way up to

1748
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:06,000
seven gallons

1749
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,960
anything different for like 10 gallon

1750
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,760
pots 15 gallon pots 20 gallon pots as

1751
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,119
far as how you would lay out the the

1752
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,960
bigger pots

1753
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,400
and again like 15 gallons up is where i

1754
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,920
start looking at this

1755
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,760
you know 10 gallon pot maybe you want to

1756
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,440
sink a nine inch carrot in there in

1757
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,160
addition so like a nice

1758
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,559
kind of deluxe setup for that or or

1759
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:28,078
higher and set up is

1760
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:30,559
you know it'd be a five inch carrot with

1761
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:33,039
like say five distribution drippers

1762
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:35,440
around the outside edge of the pot the

1763
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:37,119
distribution drippers would would water

1764
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,798
and then you take a second nine inch

1765
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,240
carrot and sink it right near the base

1766
00:56:38,798 --> 00:56:41,280
of the plant

1767
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:42,959
so

1768
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,680
so the outer

1769
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,519
ring uh the outer outer you know outer

1770
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:49,838
edge of the pot is is

1771
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:51,599
being monitored by the five-inch carrot

1772
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:52,719
and and then the and then there's just

1773
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,798
one single

1774
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:56,159
drip point near the base of the plant

1775
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:58,239
that's being monitored you know being

1776
00:56:56,159 --> 00:57:01,118
monitored by the the nine inch and that

1777
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:02,959
kind of mimics that like inverse

1778
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:05,358
pyramid that

1779
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,720
uh a root mass tends to you know you

1780
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:07,920
take a plant out and

1781
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:10,719
shake it and you notice that there's

1782
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,240
generally like a lot of roots on the top

1783
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:14,159
and then there's like the tap root down

1784
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:15,358
the middle so if you look at the the

1785
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:16,879
root mass of the planet kind of looks

1786
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:17,838
like that inverse pyramid so we're

1787
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,119
measuring

1788
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:21,599
um

1789
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:22,880
soil moisture kind of in you know in

1790
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,838
conju

1791
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:27,119
that corresponds to that

1792
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:29,119
structure so that's for that's nice for

1793
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:30,318
a 10 gallon nine inch in the middle

1794
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,079
and then

1795
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:33,119
five inch with five trippers

1796
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:35,280
um

1797
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:36,400
and then yeah once you get 15 and above

1798
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,640
you know having a little piece of that

1799
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,160
blue soak on one carrot is great

1800
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:41,279
you know it really gives nice super even

1801
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:43,279
coverage

1802
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,798
and then the bigger the pots we get

1803
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:48,720
you know we get into

1804
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:50,239
30s 45 65s 100s 200s whatever

1805
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:52,159
really it's just usually a big spiral

1806
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:53,838
that blue spoke silk because that stuff

1807
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:55,598
we can turn corners with it it doesn't

1808
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:57,440
kink um

1809
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:59,920
so we can just do like one big spiral

1810
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,519
and you know soil dries out and a nice

1811
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,519
even layer of water gets laid down on

1812
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:05,440
top of it how about some of the common

1813
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:07,199
beds like i know a lot of folks are like

1814
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,400
three by three bed four by four bed five

1815
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:09,598
by five bed

1816
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,000
yeah what would you do for that you

1817
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,039
could still do that um you know you with

1818
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,920
the

1819
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:15,358
uh

1820
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,720
you know like three by three four by

1821
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:18,719
four you still do that spiral kind of

1822
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:20,879
shape if you wanted to with a carrot and

1823
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:24,798
then kind of over that we use this

1824
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,798
double manifold system where basically

1825
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,318
the carrot feeds into a little header of

1826
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,200
this eight millimeter tubing and then

1827
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:33,759
off of that are four lines of drip of

1828
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:34,960
drip soap of the blue soak the

1829
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,040
soaker hose

1830
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,240
so one carats can you know basically is

1831
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:40,239
controlling

1832
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:41,838
uh four eight foot lines that like on a

1833
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:42,879
four by eight bed for instance you know

1834
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:45,279
you'd have a

1835
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,960
one carat that when it turns on it feeds

1836
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,720
into a little header and that header

1837
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:51,039
waters four eight foot lines that run

1838
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:52,639
the length of the bed and um well

1839
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:55,199
actually sometimes we'll kind of mirror

1840
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:56,639
that structure on both sides of the bed

1841
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:58,318
so you have two carrots and they both

1842
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,000
feed into the same system so if either

1843
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:01,920
carrot dries out

1844
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,679
it turns on the water

1845
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,440
and and can fill it so you're kind of

1846
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:07,519
monitoring a couple different places in

1847
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,798
the bed with what with maybe a nine inch

1848
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:11,039
and a five inch

1849
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:13,679
but yeah the double manifold bed is

1850
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:16,639
that's how we water everything

1851
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:17,759
from like four by four four by eight up

1852
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:19,440
because again a lot of these guys are

1853
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,599
growing in like you know four by

1854
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,720
nineties or four by 120 even or

1855
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,680
something like that

1856
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:25,358
um

1857
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:26,480
and big greenhouses or big indoor

1858
00:59:25,358 --> 00:59:28,159
applications

1859
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,400
and then we just break up like oh every

1860
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:33,598
10 feet there's like a zone

1861
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,920
you know down the road or whatever

1862
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,599
awesome well we could sit here and talk

1863
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,519
for another three hours if we really

1864
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,599
wanted to but we're gonna end it here at

1865
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:43,199
the one hour mark tell us how can the

1866
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:44,640
listeners find you and what do you have

1867
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:46,159
upcoming in the future

1868
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:48,558
