1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,870
what's up everybody feel that don't know

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,429
me my name is Chris aka mr. grow it and

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,899
you're watching my extras channel got a

4
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:09,179
topic video for you today

5
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,160
well actually topic / discussion video

6
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,199
for you today something I definitely

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,599
want to get your feedback on so every

8
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,750
morning I wake up and I drink a cup of

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,670
coffee and I pull out a book and I can't

10
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,899
start drinking my coffee until I'm

11
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,460
reading my book that's how I get myself

12
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:26,518
to read in the current book I'm reading

13
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,130
right now is MJ horticulture the

14
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:31,589
indoor-outdoor medical growers Bible and

15
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:34,350
this is by Jorge Cervantes absolute

16
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:36,869
classic I believe this version came out

17
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,850
in 2006 I've browsed through this before

18
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:40,799
but now I've gone back to it and now I'm

19
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,570
reading it cover to cover and one of the

20
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,718
things that really jumped out on me is

21
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,719
on page 164 it's the section on lighting

22
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,370
and I'm gonna read this off to you and I

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,230
want to get your feedback in the comment

24
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:54,988
section below so this is something that

25
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:57,779
I've done to my plants which is give it

26
00:00:54,988 --> 00:01:00,599
a period of darkness between vegetation

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,939
and flowering I gave my plants a period

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,739
of darkness and thought that it went to

29
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:06,810
flowering faster so I thought it started

30
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,400
flowering faster then I did it to some

31
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,728
other plants and didn't think that was

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,799
the case so I'm not really sure if this

33
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:16,140
truly works or not but reading this book

34
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,118
kind of gave me some hope again now I

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,478
have talked about this idea to others

36
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:23,670
and for example Mike over on patreon as

37
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,978
a patreon supporter he said that he

38
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,450
experiment with this as well and I

39
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:30,000
forget what he said off top of my head

40
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,939
but I believe he said that it did work

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,549
for him um let me read off these few

42
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:36,269
sentences here and then and then we'll

43
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,118
talk from there

44
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:41,129
so what it says on page 164 give plants

45
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,319
36 hours of total darkness

46
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:45,449
just before inducing flowering with 12

47
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,250
12 photo period this heavy dose of

48
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,680
darkness sends plants an unmistakable

49
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,969
signal to flower sooner growers using

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,159
this technique report that plants

51
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:55,769
normally show signs of flowering such as

52
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,479
pistol formation within two weeks and

53
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:59,250
develop pistols after a week of

54
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:01,078
flowering growers ever experimented with

55
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,968
giving plants up to 48 hours of total

56
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,099
darkness to jump-start flowering and

57
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:07,109
have found that 36 hours three

58
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:08,909
continuous 12-hour nights is most

59
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:10,439
effective I'm so again this is something

60
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:11,949
I've done with my plants actually before

61
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,598
even reading this I've

62
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:15,549
my plants a period of darkness just

63
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,259
thinking that the additional darkness

64
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,030
would kind of give them that jumpstart

65
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:20,378
into flowering now we're not talking

66
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,598
about Auto flowers here right Auto

67
00:02:20,378 --> 00:02:24,250
flowers stay on the same light cycle you

68
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:26,139
can keep them on like an 18-6 light

69
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,120
cycle for example throughout their

70
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:30,309
entire grill this is for a photo period

71
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,379
plants which need a period of extended

72
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,330
darkness so around 12 hours of darkness

73
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:35,889
complete darkness and then the plant

74
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,300
will start flowering so during the

75
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:39,009
darkness beard what happens what

76
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,019
actually happens with the plant what it

77
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:42,789
does is it produces a hormone hormones

78
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:44,739
called Flor gentle it's called a

79
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:47,289
flowering hormone and once those

80
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:48,700
florigen levels have built up then it

81
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:49,870
will start to flowers so my thought

82
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:52,119
process behind this would give that

83
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,400
plant an additional period of darkness

84
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,019
than those florigen levels will build up

85
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,700
and then it would start to flower sooner

86
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:59,709
I did this for several grows and I

87
00:02:57,699 --> 00:03:02,048
thought I could see the transition

88
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,299
happened faster but then I did it for

89
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:06,510
another grow and it didn't seem to

90
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:09,219
transition faster so I kind of just

91
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:11,949
shook it off and then stopped doing it

92
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:14,169
but then reading this makes me want to

93
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:16,179
do it again and experiment with a little

94
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:17,738
bit more but I would love to know you

95
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,230
guys out there who are growing who have

96
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,000
maybe tried this do you give your plants

97
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:24,129
a period of darkness between the

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,930
vegetation stage going into the flower

99
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:28,359
stage again I'm talking about photo

100
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,219
period plants so for photo paper plants

101
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:32,769
do you give your plants you know 24

102
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:35,049
hours of darkness 36 48 hours of

103
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:37,900
darkness and then go into the flowering

104
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:40,209
stage and if you do that have you seen a

105
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,389
faster transition of flowering so

106
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:45,159
showing signs of sex faster than when

107
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,900
you don't do it let me know down in the

108
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,549
comments section below that's really all

109
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,500
I wanted to cover in this video I will

110
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:51,879
link this book down in the description

111
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,340
section below definitely recommend it

112
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:56,560
for intermediate to advanced growers

113
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,269
beginners I mean I bought this when I

114
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,469
was beginner I just a lot of it's just

115
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:01,719
one over my head to be honest with you

116
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:03,549
but if you're trying to take your grow

117
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:06,068
up to the next level this one is

118
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:07,329
definitely good read so it's pretty much

119
