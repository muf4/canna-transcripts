1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
coming up on garden talk if i feel like

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,399
i'm off on the schedule or the plant is

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,800
showing signs of like under

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,320
food or too much food then it gives me

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,160
an immediate idea of like how much i

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,320
need to either dial back the fluoroflex

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,160
or give them a little more any kind of

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,320
training method that's out there i

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,278
probably tried it with an auto and i

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,359
don't see any significant difference

11
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,960
but honestly after like a year of doing

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,800
that and just seeing what was coming out

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,320
of heaven's town running 18-6 and then

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,278
seeing what was coming out of my tent in

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,679
24 i felt like there was no there was no

16
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,159
real difference if you are planning on

17
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,320
transplanting them it's on a timeline

18
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:41,439
you have to keep that in mind all these

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,439
like theories i i guess against autos

20
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,920
when they're like don't tap don't do

21
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:49,039
this or don't do that all it comes down

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,600
to is two things your timeline and your

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,600
genetics

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,079

their sf series led grow lights in the

48
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,798
old version the samsung diodes are close

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,399
together resulting in the light being

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,799
more focused towards the center of the

51
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,040
coverage area in the new version the

52
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,960
samsung diodes are spaced out resulting

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,118
in a better light spread across the

54
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,039
coverage area i will leave a link to a

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,400
for me usually i'm only youtubing one

101
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,319
person at a time this time i've got to

102
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,599
interview two people at a time so

103
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,679
something a little bit different for

104
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,759
this podcast but i figured why not you

105
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,239
know you guys come as a team there as a

106
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,639
group yeah we are a package deal yeah

107
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,200
there we go packaged we are it's pretty

108
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,199
much the beginning we've just

109
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,878
learned to grow yeah

110
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,119
we bounce off each other so it's hard

111
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,878
not to you know yeah it's just not the

112
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,840
same when one person is gone you don't

113
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,919
get the dynamic that

114
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,200
is that's what i figured so

115
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:04,639
so yeah let's talk about some

116
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,399
autoflowers we'll talk all about

117
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,079
autoflowers today i want to get deep

118
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,400
into it really find out what you guys do

119
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,920
in in the garden but first let's do an

120
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,360
introduction can you tell us a little

121
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,518
bit about yourself and kind of how you

122
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,720
got into gardening

123
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,798
um i guess that starts with me because i

124
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,720
um as like i

125
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,198
was telling you before i've been

126
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,120
observing you know um the growth of

127
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,240
plants in my whole life even though it

128
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,840
wasn't legal um you know and it's always

129
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,439
been something that i've been interested

130
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:34,719
in and even just growing plants in

131
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,639
general

132
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,440
has always been pretty interesting for

133
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,960
me

134
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:43,199
so when it became legal here in michigan

135
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,399
it was almost a no-brainer for me to

136
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,680
just like

137
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:51,679
to try it myself because obviously i

138
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,519
i'm a user of the plant and um and i uh

139
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,319
and it's just something that i just knew

140
00:04:53,519 --> 00:05:02,399
that i was going to be interested in and

141
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:04,478
um so i started growing my myself and um

142
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,799
that's and like really right in the

143
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,719
beginning is right when i met neil so he

144
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,720
just kind of jumped on along with me

145
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,639
yeah and when i when i met her is when

146
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,800
she was growing and i of course when it

147
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,038
came up in michigan to vote for it like

148
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,319
heck yeah i voted for it and it passed

149
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,159
and everything and it kind of fell by

150
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,079
the wayside like i wasn't like gung-ho

151
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,680
about growing but i was like i voted for

152
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,839
it because i was like heck yeah it

153
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,840
should be legal and heck yeah

154
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,839
maybe i want to grow it someday but then

155
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,319
after i saw her growing it kind of like

156
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,638
got me excited about it and then i had

157
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,038
ordered her some seeds for her birthday

158
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,560
uh some sour diesel autos and then that

159
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:39,439
was like our introduction to auto

160
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,959
because i didn't know there was a

161
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,519
difference when i ordered them i'm just

162
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,758
like yeah auto sounds impressive yeah i

163
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,599
didn't even know they i had no idea that

164
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,280
it was even uh there was even a

165
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,919
difference in plants when he ordered

166
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,359
them we had no idea yeah but we just

167
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,959
kind of fell in love with the autos and

168
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,639
then that you know we started growing

169
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,719
those and started the youtube and that's

170
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,560
kind of what got us into

171
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,840
i guess where we are we just thought hey

172
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,918
you know as beginners we we wanted to uh

173
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:09,918
show show

174
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,839
you know really that if we can do it

175
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:12,959
anybody can do it like

176
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,839
if

177
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,680
and

178
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,638
we don't know what we're doing you know

179
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,840
we started we had no clue so it's almost

180
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,400
like we wanted to show people that if

181
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,719
if they want to they can do it yeah so

182
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,318
it's just kind of kind of snowballed

183
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,720
that's awesome yeah it does take some

184
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,039
learning right some patience in order to

185
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,560
do it but definitely anybody can learn

186
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,079
how to do it i think

187
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,038
yeah so that's really cool how both of

188
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:41,038
you kind of came together like that so

189
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,680
you guys are you in the same garden

190
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:46,719
right what's your style of gardening are

191
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,759
you indoor outdoor are you soil cocoa

192
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,599
hydro

193
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,598
organic synthetic

194
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,598
about to open the can of worms here

195
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,279
um

196
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,159
well we started organic

197
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,159
um

198
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,680
and and that was actually at my house we

199
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,960
actually don't we actually don't live

200
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,120
together yeah so

201
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,598
in the state of michigan

202
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,199
we can have 12 plants per household so

203
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,519
we actually have two different growths

204
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,759
yeah so we can afford the luxury of

205
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,439
basically you know we're we see each

206
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,038
other as much as we can we live like an

207
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,639
hour away from each other so it makes it

208
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,240
hard to make the content and stuff like

209
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,800
that but we're doing the best we can but

210
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,478
basically like heaven has her own grow

211
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,560
which is the five by five and then i

212
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,800
have like the four by four so we're not

213
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,639
necessarily growing the same stuff or

214
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,240
styles we've been like going crazy you

215
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,639
know trying all these different things

216
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,319
that we can uh and just having fun with

217
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,240
it so we do have like our each our own

218
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,360
grow that we're both like involved with

219
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,598
but not

220
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,479
directly i guess because you know it's

221
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:47,360
not like i'm i'm growing more organic

222
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,318
and actually lately and um neil's

223
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,120
actually

224
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,680
ending one of his first runs with

225
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,840
with uh synthetics yeah i was we were

226
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,680
both doing organics i actually started

227
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,839
with organics i've been using nature's

228
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,240
living soil i've actually tried dry

229
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,799
amendments

230
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,639
and i really love that and actually i

231
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,960
get to learn the plant and what it's

232
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,519
telling me i feel like

233
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,598
and i get to learn it at an accelerated

234
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,079
rate with autos yeah

235
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,759
um because every plant is different

236
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,240
every plant's showing me in a different

237
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,240
way and i have to learn okay this is

238
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,079
what that means with this kind of

239
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,720
phenotype so i feel like i'm learning at

240
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,079
almost an accelerated rate with autos

241
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,680
but

242
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,240
i mean

243
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,879
i'm growing organic so you are actually

244
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,879
yeah

245
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,320
how you're growing i started to doing

246
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,320
the organics we were kind of doing the

247
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,560
same thing like dry amendments and like

248
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,200
what we saw like watching mr canucks and

249
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,199
like all the videos we've seen online uh

250
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,360
but then i so i tried that for basically

251
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,519
the last year um and then switched over

252
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,759
recently to try coco and like floor flex

253
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,120
and synthetic newts i mean it's like

254
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,039
completely different you know like i'm

255
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,519
not use it's a whole different thing but

256
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,120
i almost kind of like it in a way so you

257
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,600
know it just gives us some flexibility

258
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,120
to try different things with our grows

259
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,360
um and you know we're always just

260
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,278
bouncing ideas off each other and we're

261
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,399
actually doing um something on our

262
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:09,919
channel right now we're actually

263
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,519
documenting right now

264
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:15,439
um we're trying to the same strain in

265
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,799
one organic one six

266
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,640
synthetic so

267
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,319
um hopefully everybody can follow along

268
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,120
they'll be able to yeah it's a really

269
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,240
fun

270
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,600
fun one you guys can follow along with

271
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,680
so for autos in particular

272
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,600
container size is a big thing right so

273
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,359
some people will start in a small

274
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,639
container you know small solo cup and

275
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,639
then they'll transplant up into

276
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,799
different size containers some people

277
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,799
are adamant that you should be starting

278
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,359
in your final container right so they'll

279
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,039
start like a a three or a five gallon

280
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,959
grill pot and then they'll keep that

281
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,159
plant in that container for the entire

282
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,719
life

283
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:53,039
what container size are you typically in

284
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,560
and do you do transplanting like that or

285
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,039
what

286
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:59,039
i think you should start this one

287
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:02,719
yeah

288
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,639
well i i actually am for the transplant

289
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,079
and i actually have a couple reasons why

290
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,958
i do that

291
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:08,879
um

292
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:12,239
but

293
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:15,039
i i don't think i'm really just totally

294
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,399
one side or the other i just feel like

295
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:20,240
the transplant is just easier for my my

296
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,919
lifestyle um

297
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,919
honestly

298
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,399
i don't feel like putting it in the

299
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:29,039
final pot or transplanting it is doing

300
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,000
too much of harm but i do think that

301
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,519
there is that fine line there's a time

302
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,799
there's definitely a time where it gets

303
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,720
past where it

304
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,958
it's it's an auto so it's on a timeline

305
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,680
you have to think about that throughout

306
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,719
seed to the end no matter what anyway

307
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,838
um

308
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,320
so

309
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,279
for me i do the transplant

310
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,800
but i do that because sometimes

311
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:52,799
seeds don't make it

312
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:55,599
and i don't want a whole pot that i made

313
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,519
up and you know i'm i have a perpetual

314
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,959
grow so it's almost like that pot will

315
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,799
just sit around if it doesn't have

316
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,559
something in it

317
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,278
so for me

318
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:08,719
it's easier to just wait that

319
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:12,480
nine to 11 days

320
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,720
before i transplant them to make sure

321
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,120
but for neil i think

322
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,720
you do it differently yeah so heaven's

323
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,720
pretty much always done starting solo

324
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,480
cups and then transplant into final pot

325
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,079
i've pretty much always gone like i'll

326
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,320
germinate them and i just do the paper

327
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,958
towel method like ghetto style but it

328
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,480
works good so i'm sticking with that so

329
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,159
i just wait till it's got a pretty good

330
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,079
tap root on it and then put it in the

331
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,439
final pot uh and that's the way i've

332
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:37,759
pretty much always done ours but we've

333
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,360
seen so many comments about like oh you

334
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,519
can't transplant or don't start in a

335
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,278
small thing with autos like honestly

336
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,799
over the the year or so that we've been

337
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,399
doing the channel and it grows like

338
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,879
heaven's autos that she's always done

339
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,278
solo cup to final pot are you know

340
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:54,078
huge the huge ones ones that turn out

341
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,919
five feet tall and are just insane uh

342
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,599
and it's you know she transplanted them

343
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,639
and people are like oh you can't do like

344
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,560
i feel like there's definitely some

345
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,399
myths and things uh but we're just we

346
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,119
try everything like we don't care we'll

347
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,600
see what happens but again as with autos

348
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,278
i just feel like it's on a timeline even

349
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,360
even the transplant is on a timeline

350
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,600
no matter what with autos it's on a

351
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,079
timeline so if you are planning on

352
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,399
transplanting them it's on a timeline

353
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:21,679
you have to keep that in mind

354
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,440
i agree yeah you're definitely going to

355
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,278
do it on time because if it does come

356
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,279
root bound in that small container it

357
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,720
could lead to a certain growth which

358
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,720
like you said it's on a timeline you

359
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,800
could get those little baby

360
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,360
a little one night yep so you do have

361
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:37,039
there is a yeah there's a time where you

362
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,320
if it's too late

363
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,599
but there are benefits too so i've done

364
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,040
both i've

365
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,278
you know started in the final container

366
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,958
and then i've also done the solo cup and

367
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:46,958
then transplant up i haven't done enough

368
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,719
to really have a solid opinion on it you

369
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,599
know what i mean i agree actually i did

370
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,519
try that one time i did try that we did

371
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,440
the so yeah one more one

372
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,278
one video

373
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,560
it was a it was like a three transplant

374
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,519
without all that

375
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:04,838
the plant itself was very healthy

376
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:08,320
actually it just didn't get very big

377
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,639
yeah but it never ran out of nutrients

378
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,959
like it was always it was

379
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,360
it was always okay it did i mean it

380
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,719
ended up being pretty flame actually

381
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,879
yeah because i assume you're probably

382
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,040
transplanting into soil that has amended

383
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,159
with some sort of nutrition in there so

384
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,240
yeah as you're transplanting up you're

385
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,919
basically feeding the plant in a sense

386
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,919
right because it's a new medium on that

387
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,759
one and then some people will swear by

388
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,838
transplanting because they want the

389
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,319
opportunity to have access to the root

390
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,880
zone to sprinkle microbes on there right

391
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,240
so mycorrhizal fungi is one of them that

392
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,000
is an extension of the root zone it's

393
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,519
going to help with nutrient uptake and

394
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,078
that's best applied when it's directly

395
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,600
onto the roots so some people are like

396
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,599
yes transplant always transmit they're

397
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,440
hardcore transplanters because of that

398
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,959
reason alone so there are so many

399
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,800
different ways to go about it i was just

400
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,198
wondering how you guys went about the

401
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,639
autos you know so yeah we love it we say

402
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,120
you gotta grow to know so if you're

403
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,519
curious freaking try it you know i i

404
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,078
haven't tried all the methods there is

405
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,919
out there to transplant and honestly i'd

406
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:09,919
like to try more um so if people have

407
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,078
techniques that i haven't heard of you

408
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,759
could totally throw them my way

409
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:14,958
absolutely yeah always welcome

410
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,078
especially in the comments section of

411
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,078
this video if you're tuning in on

412
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,838
youtube comment section share some best

413
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:22,078
practices i love that i love when people

414
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,839
are able to share their experience on

415
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,679
how they do things because others can

416
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,360
read and learn and potentially implement

417
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,120
in their garden so that's one thing i

418
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,039
love about the community let's talk

419
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,799
about plant training a little bit so

420
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,639
we'll start with topping

421
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,799
topping autoflowers that's another uh

422
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,320
controversial thing right you can't top

423
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,399
autos you can't tell auto some people do

424
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,160
it some people swear by it

425
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,078
what are you guys stance on topping

426
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:45,439
autos

427
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,919
um

428
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,279
i feel like if the plant wants it yeah

429
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,599
it it

430
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,759
it definitely depends

431
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,519
completely i feel like

432
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,399
on again the the timing of it

433
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,480
and

434
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,440
in genetics yeah

435
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,399
i mean

436
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,399
in my opinion when we've i mean we've

437
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,240
stopped how many we talked a lot we

438
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,720
tried a bunch in groceries we tried

439
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,639
multi-tops just single tops

440
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,480
yeah i feel like what we found for autos

441
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,879
that seems to work the best is like if

442
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,519
it's one that is over performing or like

443
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,958
getting tall really quickly like after a

444
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,720
round it has like five nodes we'll

445
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,719
usually top it only once because we've

446
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,800
tried like you know topping multiple

447
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,360
times it just always seems to cause more

448
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:32,399
stress than anything so it seems like

449
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,839
you know early on maybe day 25 to 30 and

450
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,480
just if you're gonna tap it just a

451
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,320
single single time uh on the main one

452
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,159
that's what what we seem to works about

453
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,320
but we've definitely done both and you

454
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,759
know so definitely some perform and turn

455
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,240
out great it gives you a really even

456
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,199
canopy and like you know we usually do

457
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,519
trim off also the bottom nodes early um

458
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:55,519
instead of topping i feel like taking

459
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,120
the bottom nodes off um seems to do a

460
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,039
lot better for the plant because the

461
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,120
bottom nodes never end up being anything

462
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,198
substantial anyway that's what we've

463
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,278
noticed so we always like that's the

464
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,838
first thing we chop actually like like

465
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,278
the earliest probably day 20 23 we'll

466
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,959
cut the very bottom two notes because

467
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:13,120
they never really end up growing out to

468
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,719
be anything so it's like get rid of them

469
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,560
as soon as possible give it a little

470
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,000
time to recover and if it is still

471
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,198
beasting out

472
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,278
then then we would usually do a top yeah

473
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:25,679
yeah but again with autos it's on a

474
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,519
timeline yeah yeah i know some people

475
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,239
who have you know some of these genetics

476
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,839
are just so vigorous so vigorous

477
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,399
especially if you put them in the right

478
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,839
media like an airy medium with cocoa and

479
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,320
you get that all that oxygen the root

480
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,519
zone it's just real optimized vpd co2

481
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,839
all that stuff

482
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,039
where they're running into height issues

483
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,959
right you think of autos you think of

484
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,198
them being real small and stuff yeah

485
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:49,119
some people want to top autos and for

486
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:51,198
height reasons and also to reshape the

487
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,440
plant right once you top that apical

488
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,799
meristem that that main chute it's going

489
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,240
to promote growth on those lower

490
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:57,599
branches so it'll help with kind of an

491
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,839
even canopy and stuff like that so there

492
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,920
are benefits there but the the folks on

493
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,078
the other side are saying yeah any sort

494
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:07,519
of stunt growth on autos anytime you

495
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:09,519
talk is gonna reduce your yield so i

496
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,359
think that's another controversial thing

497
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:13,918
where you just gotta do it and try it

498
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:16,318
out for yourself right you gotta uh yeah

499
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,880
i'm not necessarily

500
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:21,838
i feel like all these like theories i i

501
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,199
guess against autos um when they're like

502
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,639
don't tap don't transplant don't do this

503
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,679
or don't do that

504
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,679
um

505
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:34,160
all it comes down to is two things

506
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,759
your timeline and your genetics

507
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,600
that's it i mean

508
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,480
when you really come it that's what it

509
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,319
is

510
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,240
so when people say don't do this so

511
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,678
don't do that i mean

512
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,359
where are you getting this information

513
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,360
from how do you know

514
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,678
because you didn't try this strain with

515
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,839
that you know you

516
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,798
you can't really say we we've noticed

517
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,639
that the

518
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:56,798
auto genetics aren't definitely as solid

519
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,480
as like photos so you know the one that

520
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,558
we're gonna do stuff with is that one

521
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,319
that's like performing like ridiculous

522
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,399
and it's like shooting up super tall

523
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,839
like real fast and it's like well we

524
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,519
better do something about that you can

525
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,678
pretty much either only tie it over or

526
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:12,079
you can tap it but it usually if it's

527
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,160
growing so vigorously that we think that

528
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:15,759
way you know it's gonna if you top it

529
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,600
it's still gonna do pretty good like

530
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,960
it's gonna recover quickly and just keep

531
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,879
growing like nothing happens i don't i

532
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,279
don't know if i prefer the topping

533
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,400
method but we don't every time it just

534
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:29,200
kind of plant dictates yeah what we do

535
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,798
yeah now how about low stress training

536
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,120
that's something that's often done in

537
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:34,879
order again to get an even canopy and

538
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,719
help with even coal size across the

539
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,880
plant and stuff like that and it's very

540
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,120
common with autoflowers do you do low

541
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,840
stress training at all

542
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:46,479
oh yeah yeah we do we do um the tie over

543
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,079
method um we use a big i'm a big fan of

544
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,919
the garden stakes because they're easily

545
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,839
positionable and you can start to train

546
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,440
it even if the arms aren't or the

547
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,359
branches aren't to the edge of the pot

548
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,880
like some of the tie-down ones i don't

549
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,240
know it's just easier to move around so

550
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,720
we've been using the garden stakes

551
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,079
mostly um and the basement autoflowers

552
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,160
training bags those are bottom two we've

553
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:06,000
been using those uh but you know we'll

554
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,558
either usually tie it over or just like

555
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,400
light branch stuff um kind of some more

556
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,000
tie overs lately as we try and like

557
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,400
control the height and try and get a

558
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,720
really even canopy without stressing it

559
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,960
too hard so that's usually tying it over

560
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,160
at an earlier age or maybe that's what

561
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,360
i've been that's what i've been

562
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,440
implementing

563
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:26,319
recently in my grow is just

564
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,320
the tie over

565
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,839
but

566
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,679
i don't i don't even know if it really

567
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,720
it helps necessarily yield

568
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,280
um versus just letting it grow on its

569
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,798
own i don't i don't necessarily think

570
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,960
that i think that the plant's going to

571
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:45,660
give you what it's going to give you

572
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,200
in in

573
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,919
[Music]

574
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,600
that's just my opinion because i've i've

575
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,600
we've tried low stress training i've

576
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,719
tried christmas treeing it i've tried

577
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:58,558
topping

578
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,319
i've tried i mean any

579
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,480
any kind of training method that's out

580
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:05,119
there i've probably tried it with an

581
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,360
auto and um

582
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,479
and i don't see any significant

583
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:10,319
difference

584
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,319
um i would say

585
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:15,200
if anything maybe low stress changing

586
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:17,839
maybe tying it over would give me

587
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,038
better light to my bud sites but other

588
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:21,519
than that

589
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:23,919
i'd see no real benefit

590
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,400
behind like yield that's interesting you

591
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,400
say that i've uh kind of the opposite in

592
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,559
a sense where i've grew

593
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,159
now of course we're talking from seed

594
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:33,678
different phenotypes each seed so

595
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,960
everything's gonna grow differently it's

596
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,320
gonna depend on what generation they're

597
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,120
on and stuff like that but i had 10

598
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,480
autoflowers all the same cultivar and i

599
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,558
did some of them i did love stress

600
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,480
training on some of them i just grew

601
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:47,839
naturally christmas tree style and the

602
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,798
ones i did low stress training on

603
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:52,639
actually yielded more than the normally

604
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,879
chrono ones that were growing christmas

605
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,720
tree style so i'm i'm personally a big

606
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,159
fan of low stress training but like you

607
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,759
said everybody's everybody's different i

608
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,679
think it does come down to genetics for

609
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,879
sure it's just it's so hard to measure

610
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,640
especially since they're all different

611
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,720
phenos like there's no there's no

612
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,600
cloning of autos like you can clone an

613
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,679
auto but it's not really uh that

614
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,359
beneficial since it's on that timeline

615
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,038
like you mentioned you're not really

616
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,558
gonna get too much out of it as you

617
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,480
would if you were to just plant a seed

618
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,558
and grow that so

619
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,240
yeah i do think you definitely can see

620
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:24,480
better results though when because when

621
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,400
you do tie it over and train it um you

622
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,480
know i'll all depend on genetics and how

623
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,960
the whole grow goes but if you can get

624
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,279
even like uh penetration to the whole

625
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,960
plant rather than the top down because

626
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,798
like we have the par meter we've tested

627
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,279
like the top of the plant versus your

628
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,440
bottom nugs hundreds of pars difference

629
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,519
between that you know so if you can get

630
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,159
it as even impossible and then control

631
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,839
your light like you of course you

632
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,280
you should have better yields because

633
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,798
everything is getting the same it's not

634
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:52,879
like just the top dogs are getting the

635
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,480
best light everything down is getting

636
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,679
just kind of the lower part that's not

637
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,079
gonna you know you're gonna be more

638
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,559
lucky but i found that when we do when

639
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:02,639
we do our autos like

640
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,879
when when you start to stress train like

641
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,520
that or do your training i feel like the

642
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,880
plant just focuses its energy on a

643
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,119
certain few

644
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,080
and it just does that no matter what it

645
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:16,719
doesn't yield you more in the end it

646
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,639
just gives you maybe better flowers and

647
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,159
that's just in my opinion i guess maybe

648
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,960
people might have different opinions

649
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,120
yeah grow it and try it find out but i

650
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,798
do think that i i love low stress

651
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,959
training because again you do get better

652
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:31,679
flowers out of it and

653
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,000
i don't know about yield but

654
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,080
um if you're looking for a beautiful

655
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,440
flower like i do i i love stress

656
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:38,639
training all the time it's my preferred

657
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,558
way we're always

658
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,400
changing up what we're doing i mean i've

659
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:44,240
been liking it though yeah i do like

660
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,400
dying over it definitely makes it fun

661
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,919
now how about defoliation of auto some

662
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,759
people like to go in there and pluck off

663
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,120
leaves you know for whatever reason they

664
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,038
they do it whether it be increased

665
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:56,239
airflow throughout the plant or in order

666
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:59,119
to get light down in into the canopy do

667
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,000
you defoliate if so what's your method

668
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,079
for it

669
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,880
yeah i've kind of gone to primarily like

670
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,558
leaf tucking um at least early on i know

671
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,080
some people like gung-ho about chopping

672
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,639
but i don't know i feel like i've kind

673
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:12,639
of fall back to more leaf tucking as

674
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,480
much as i can but there's definitely

675
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,799
certain autos that are just way more

676
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,038
busy and way more bushy and it's like

677
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,720
you have to go in and start like just it

678
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:23,279
gets so thick like you're going to be

679
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,120
prone to issues and you know i i always

680
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,720
at least try and trim out the bottom

681
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,479
portion at least the bottom third to get

682
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,640
the airflow and kind of keep everything

683
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,880
good you know trim up the bottom side

684
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,400
branches and then just selectively i

685
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,799
could just kind of groom through it to

686
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,200
make sure like what i want to be exposed

687
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:41,679
is we actually just put a video out of

688
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,480
one of our defoliation

689
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,559
um

690
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,759
but again like he said i try to leaf

691
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:50,158
talk as much as possible until

692
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,558
my leaves are covering bud sites and

693
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,559
then i'll just get rid of them um i know

694
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,639
a lot of people will

695
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,399
try you know to leaf talk as much as

696
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,559
possible but i just find sometimes it

697
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,000
just ends up hindering the plant

698
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:05,359
so you gotta really just just read your

699
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,278
plant just

700
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:10,959
you know you gotta

701
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:10,960
you gotta become one with your plant

702
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,000
absolutely

703
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,639
let's flip it up let's talk about

704
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,400
nutrients so what nutrients i i know you

705
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,919
said you were organic

706
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,640
and so

707
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,480
what nutrient line are you using and how

708
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,640
often are you doing feedings

709
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,200
me well since i recently switched i've

710
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,559
been using floraflex with coco and

711
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,558
man i'm just following the schedule

712
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,480
dumping dumping the water in and it's

713
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:36,639
going amazing it feels like cheating it

714
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,558
feels like teeth growing it is cheating

715
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,640
let's be friends the scientists have

716
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,480
already figured it's too easy it's been

717
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,480
flawless it's beasted out there's one in

718
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,000
there that man i don't it's not even i'm

719
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,159
not even gonna call it an auto because

720
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,319
it's at day 74 and it's like barely

721
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,919
starting to bud uh so i'm probably going

722
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:53,759
to run that thing over the snow blower

723
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,559
tomorrow yeah we're going to probably

724
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,158
have

725
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,158
there's going to be a cool office slow

726
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,960
motion

727
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,559
you know

728
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,600
but it's just taking too long so i'm

729
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:03,359
like yeah

730
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,079
forget that one

731
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,599
so you liking the floor flex

732
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,119
yeah i actually i think it's pretty

733
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,119
great like i'm not really opposed to

734
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,399
organics or synthetics but i mean

735
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,879
simplicity

736
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,038
uh you know it's easy to follow i don't

737
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,039
like you add it to my tap water and then

738
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,558
the ph is perfect like all i do is mix

739
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:22,640
up the powder it's not fair and dump it

740
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,558
through the cocoa and you know the big

741
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,320
thing is just watering more with cocoa

742
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:27,918
definitely compared to organics and what

743
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:30,158
we were doing so heaven's been running

744
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,278
organically like

745
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,360
i

746
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:36,000
currently i'm running at nature's living

747
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:38,399
soil which is an organic mix and i just

748
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,038
mix that with hp

749
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:46,480
the pro-mix pro-mix and um i also use

750
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:48,400
some worm castings and then i add the

751
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,319
harvest hero

752
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,400
uh a little perlite to make it a little

753
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:53,918
bit more airy just because that we

754
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,080
seem to find the autos like it with at

755
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,640
least something in there to make it more

756
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:00,960
airy if it's a cocoa or perlite or both

757
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,000
or whatever you want to throw in there

758
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,759
so um that's what i've been running and

759
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,240
i

760
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:11,119
i think i'm dialing it in pretty well

761
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,919
it's taken me quite a while

762
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:14,639
to

763
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,440
really figure it out but again i feel

764
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,360
like

765
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,320
i'm learning in an accelerated race and

766
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:26,158
every phenotype is different and it's

767
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:28,158
it's it's hard it's hard with autos yeah

768
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,360
i mean it's easy but it's hard at the

769
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,880
same time

770
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:32,558
that's like one thing for people getting

771
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,320
into autos like yeah they're fun and

772
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:36,639
they're accelerated but there's like

773
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,558
also kind of no second chances

774
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,919
oh yeah you've got to learn it and move

775
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:41,678
yeah because the plants are going to

776
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,200
keep going like it wants to go so if

777
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,559
you're ready with nutrients you're not

778
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,640
especially like learning with dry

779
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,399
amendments which take time to break down

780
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,640
so you got to be okay with just letting

781
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,320
things go yeah like it's it's a learning

782
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,840
process maybe that's why the floraflex

783
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,079
is doing so well because it's like

784
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,918
immediate feeding like it's not waiting

785
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,759
for this to break down always did it

786
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,759
break down a week later than i wanted it

787
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,359
to when the plant needed it yeah it's

788
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,278
just like floraflex i'm just like

789
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:07,678
dumping in what it looks like it needs i

790
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:10,640
feel like as a new grower and doing it

791
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,240
organically is so hard because you have

792
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,720
to understand

793
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,880
that you need to understand the soil and

794
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,480
not only the plant and a lot of people

795
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,679
don't understand that you're not only

796
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,720
reading the plant you're reading your

797
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,720
soil

798
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,120
and this is something that i've like the

799
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,839
microbes in there it's like i've been so

800
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:31,359
resistant really to learning about my

801
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,959
soil and more about the plant and um

802
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,639
i i feel like

803
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,440
that's something that i need to be more

804
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,880
aware of and i need to advocate really

805
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,720
more for because

806
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,880
i haven't been doing it it's a

807
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,399
relationship yeah it really is so with

808
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,600
organics like i said you're not only

809
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:47,359
reading the plant you're reading the

810
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,439
soil and you need to know that your soil

811
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,639
is also

812
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,919
healthy

813
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,080
and if your soil is not healthy your

814
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,159
plant's not going to be healthy

815
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:58,798
so those are things that i've

816
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,559
man need to overcome as far as like an

817
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,639
organic grower i think that's a great

818
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,960
way to put it i mean they need time to

819
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,320
break down right so those worm castings

820
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,399
that you're adding in and the nature

821
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,000
living soil that whatever amendments are

822
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:11,759
within that microbes need to break those

823
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,200
down first and put them into a form

824
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,119
that's available for the plant to uptake

825
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,798
right so it does there's a little bit of

826
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,119
waiting period there so you know if

827
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,480
you're seeing a deficiency

828
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:21,759
then you might want to have move on to

829
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,839
something that's kind of more fast

830
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,599
acting versus like a top dress of

831
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:27,199
amendments you know what i mean yeah

832
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:28,879
exactly and i think we definitely had a

833
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,720
learning curve where we were learning

834
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,320
that like we were just using dry

835
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,159
amendments and we're hitting issues and

836
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,720
it takes too long for what we're trying

837
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,880
to mix in to get to the plant like how

838
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,558
can you you know how do you correct all

839
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,640
these different issues immediately with

840
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:44,240
autos because you have to you know so

841
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,000
it's like it's a learning curve but it's

842
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,079
a fun one like we've never had any so

843
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,839
awful that we just throw the whole thing

844
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:51,278
away you know it's like something always

845
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,359
good as lease is coming out even though

846
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:55,359
we're still learning so it's fun to try

847
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,879
new things and learn every time

848
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,678
and we've just been having a blast with

849
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,399
it

850
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,840
yeah

851
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,558
so for the

852
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,798
you said nature's living soil and then

853
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:06,398
worm castings when do you typically

854
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:07,599
apply the worm castings and then also is

855
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,158
there any other amendments that you're

856
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,798
adding throughout the grill

857
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,880
um well i've

858
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:15,839
been doing right in the beginning of

859
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,600
flower

860
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:21,439
um which is i would say like around week

861
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,480
five or six

862
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,200
i

863
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,000
would start doing uh its flower girl

864
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:32,159
which is a

865
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,480
top dress with nature's living soil

866
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,080
i've started doing that

867
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,720
but i actually started something new

868
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:42,000
where i've been amending it with the

869
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,720
regular nature's living soil first

870
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,200
and then the next week doing

871
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,679
um the flower girl which is new and i

872
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,919
think it's working for me yeah but um

873
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,000
but then i then i just tap dress it

874
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,159
every week and allow it to feed the

875
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,359
plant throughout the week every now and

876
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,360
again i'll give it some molasses and

877
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,639
some recharge just to make sure they're

878
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,158
good but

879
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,120
that's probably

880
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,480
maybe

881
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:09,278
once

882
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,720
to twice every two weeks

883
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,480
so uh

884
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,240
but other than that we just water okay

885
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,720
that makes sense that's the organic side

886
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,399
and the kneel on the synthetic side with

887
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,159
the floor flex are you following their

888
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:22,000
feeding schedule that they have like

889
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,200
that i know they have different ratios

890
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,558
for the feeding schedule are you doing

891
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,960
like a full dose with that or what

892
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,639
yeah so they do have a um autoflower

893
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,558
specific schedule that you can get from

894
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,880
floor flex it's basically just like half

895
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:36,558
of their photo feeding schedule like

896
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,278
half the amounts pretty much it looks

897
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:41,278
like um so at first i thought you didn't

898
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:43,200
need calmag because i saw like a bunch

899
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,880
of them said no cal mag like mix but

900
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,360
those were i realized later all for

901
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,120
photos um so i did find that though when

902
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:51,519
i was growing the autos i did see a

903
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:53,599
little bit of spotting like brown spots

904
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:54,960
uh crop up but i just started giving a

905
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:56,959
little bit of calmaggin that went away

906
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,319
immediately um and i've just been kind

907
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,399
of tapering that off now that they're

908
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,480
kind of heavy into flour because i feel

909
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:04,798
like what's in the spoiler alert they

910
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,480
look amazing yeah it's going ridiculous

911
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,480
like i'm pretty sure it's probably gonna

912
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,919
be at least six ounces from just the

913
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,240
look of it and it's you know just the

914
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,720
very first run i was definitely under

915
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,240
feeding for a while um because i wasn't

916
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,159
sure like do i just start feeding the

917
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,159
floraflex immediately at seedling i was

918
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,120
like that seems like it might be spicy

919
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,278
so i started it in like a cocoa loco uh

920
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:27,199
mix and then for probably the first two

921
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:29,599
weeks i just gave it water because i did

922
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,319
give it like i did like a one gram of

923
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:33,599
floraflex for a gallon uh and then that

924
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:35,119
seemed to get him a little yellow and

925
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:36,959
heaven's like maybe just let him go

926
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:38,319
naturally because they do have you know

927
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,600
enough in them to get them at least

928
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:41,839
they're like their first little set of

929
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:44,319
leaves it's like just the seedlings so

930
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,678
the cocoa loco does have some stuff so

931
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,439
pretty much i just been starting in the

932
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,919
first two weeks with just water and then

933
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,320
i'll start feeding the floraflex at the

934
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,080
chart which is like 2.5 and it's been

935
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:56,319
it's been going great so got some

936
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,759
mofisto started they're beasting out so

937
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:59,200
i'm like oh man once again what are they

938
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:00,798
gonna look like

939
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,519
and then so you're feeding all the way

940
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:04,720
up

941
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,319
into flour are you stopping feeding like

942
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,319
some people will stop feeding like a

943
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,480
week or two before they harvest yeah and

944
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:12,879
then do like a flush period do you do

945
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,038
any of that or what

946
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,278
um on the schedule it has like a flush

947
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:19,038
period for the last week so it has the

948
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,119
newts right up to like the week before

949
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:22,640
flush which it kind of tapers off and

950
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:25,678
then you start your week of flush and

951
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,360
then done um but you know i i've been

952
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,120
kind of just like we've grown enough

953
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,038
autos like i can tell they're staged and

954
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:33,038
like they're just entering flower

955
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:34,720
they're just doing this so if i feel

956
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:37,278
like i'm off on the schedule or the

957
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,600
plant is showing signs of like under

958
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:41,119
food or too much food then it gives me

959
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,038
an immediate idea of like how much i

960
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:45,439
need to either dial back the floraflex

961
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:47,119
or give them a little more um and you

962
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,480
know so that's what that's just what

963
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:50,239
i've been doing with this first run and

964
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,038
it seems to be working great like almost

965
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,798
zero issues literally just water

966
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,640
that's kind of not fair

967
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,480
yeah it's it's gonna be sitting here

968
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,159
watching him do so good and i'm like man

969
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,000
i'm struggling over here that's why i

970
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,519
think the organics like in learning that

971
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,278
way makes you a better grower because

972
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,038
you have a better understanding of like

973
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:08,240
how to correct that stuff in the soil

974
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:10,398
where it's like

975
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,000
synthetics or what at least the system

976
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:15,038
i'm doing it's like dump more of this or

977
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,720
that you know less more you know so it's

978
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:17,919
not like i'm really learning anything

979
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,079
about

980
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,120
i guess how the plants grow or the soil

981
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:23,038
and the microbes and all the

982
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,518
relationships it's totally different

983
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:27,839
style of growing something i guess you

984
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,599
think about when you start growing oh

985
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,038
yeah it is yeah it's it's completely

986
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:32,558
different so many different techniques

987
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:34,640
when you're talking about synthetic

988
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:36,000
versus organic for sure i mean we go on

989
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,038
and on and on about that if we really

990
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,640
wanted to but yeah but we won't

991
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:42,398
yeah

992
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,679
that's a whole nother conversation

993
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:45,678
but on the

994
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,000
synthetic side of things a lot of people

995
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,640
do is they'll monitor the ph

996
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,798
is there a specific ph range that you

997
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,440
typically aim for or are you hands-off

998
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:57,599
when it comes to ph

999
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,399
um for synthetics wise it's been pretty

1000
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:02,480
easy like um i've always says on the bag

1001
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:05,119
like keep it between six and seven i

1002
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,000
think so it's pretty wide range i'm just

1003
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:09,759
recalling i'm not 100 sure uh but

1004
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
basically my tap pretty much comes out

1005
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,079
at seven almost exactly right around

1006
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,918
there um and i've been checking it all

1007
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,000
the time after i add the floraflex and

1008
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,319
mix up my gallons out of my feed and

1009
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,838
every time after i add that it's it's

1010
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:27,679
like ripe 6.3 6.25 6.4 so i've literally

1011
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:29,599
just been dumping it at what it ends up

1012
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,519
being and but it's always been like

1013
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,559
right in that range and the plants seem

1014
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:36,559
to be responding amazing like it's

1015
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,799
that the stock of the thing is like

1016
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,799
super duper huge i cannot believe how

1017
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,039
big it is i can't wait to chop this

1018
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,240
thing it's going to be oh my gosh

1019
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,358
yeah it's going to be a it's going to be

1020
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,279
a fun one

1021
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:49,679
and so do you also do a runoff

1022
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,159
measurement for ph or just you only

1023
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,639
monitor the ph going in

1024
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,240
i only monitor the ph going in i haven't

1025
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,160
i haven't had any issues yet to where

1026
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,159
it's like oh man maybe i should flush it

1027
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,000
out to clean the salt or something like

1028
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:04,000
i always like water at least till a

1029
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,679
little bit runs off every day but not

1030
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
enough to like flood the bottom of the

1031
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:09,919
pan like i pretty much got it to where i

1032
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,358
water and it will drain off like just

1033
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,920
enough to where because they're in air

1034
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:15,440
pots has a slightly raised bottom um

1035
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,280
just enough to where it's not flooding

1036
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,358
out and it's sitting in its own water

1037
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,079
pool so i've just been watering like

1038
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:23,279
that and keeping them like moist and

1039
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,960
you know as they get bigger you

1040
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,560
definitely have to water more i've

1041
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,240
noticed especially with the cocoa

1042
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:29,759
because it's like the plant's so huge

1043
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:31,679
it's just sucking the pot dry and it's

1044
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,440
like oh got a coat so i'm gonna rig up

1045
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:35,358
an automated watering system here i got

1046
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,358
some of the rings um and then i could

1047
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:39,598
just mix up like a big tub of freaking

1048
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:41,598
floraflex for a week and just be like

1049
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,400
set it and yeah i cannot wait for this

1050
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,160
it's gonna look dope yeah it'll be fun

1051
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,838
well it'll be easy which is the main

1052
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:48,879
slide more time to edit videos and you

1053
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:51,440
know should definitely be able to save

1054
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,880
some time there for sure now heaven on

1055
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,320
the organic side of things ph do you

1056
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,960
monitor ph at all or what do you

1057
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,880
typically do for ph

1058
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,119
okay actually this has been a

1059
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,400
conversation we've been having a lot of

1060
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,760
weeks we about to have a conversation

1061
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,039
um

1062
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:15,440
so

1063
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:19,440
i've always ph i've always ph to 6.5 um

1064
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:22,159
even before like i was having a ph pen

1065
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,200
and i was trying to ph to 6.5 i was

1066
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:24,078
trying

1067
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:25,838
um

1068
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,519
because i always knew that it was

1069
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:28,480
important but

1070
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,079
i

1071
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,199
didn't really understand why until i

1072
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:36,079
really started understanding you know

1073
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:37,439
the plant and how it uptakes nutrients

1074
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,440
um

1075
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,920
and a lot of people with organics will

1076
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,358
say well well don't don't even worry

1077
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,880
about ph don't worry about it don't

1078
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:47,440
worry about it well

1079
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,039
so in this last two

1080
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,200
two runs i want to say i hadn't been ph

1081
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:56,960
and i've actually had been running into

1082
00:36:53,199 --> 00:37:00,078
issues near the end of flower

1083
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,760
because i hadn't been phd my water to

1084
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,680
and i usually do it

1085
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,440
you know with

1086
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:10,399
a range between 6.3 and you know 6.8 and

1087
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:13,280
i try to get it around 6.5

1088
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:16,000
and that's even when i have nutrient or

1089
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,400
if even if i'm like molasses or calmac i

1090
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,159
always ph my water

1091
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,960
um

1092
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:25,598
and these last few runs i hadn't been

1093
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,240
and i actually was running into issues

1094
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,838
with uptake of nutrients i i feel like

1095
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:32,319
that's what it is because all of my

1096
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:34,960
plants were showing different signs um

1097
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,680
you know of different

1098
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,519
nutrient deficiencies in excess and i

1099
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:41,919
was like what is going the only thing

1100
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:43,280
for me that would cause that is a ph

1101
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,320
imbalance

1102
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,119
um

1103
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,680
and i just obviously made

1104
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,480
that deduction so um because all my

1105
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:55,598
plants were just so different

1106
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,838
um so i've actually

1107
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,599
my last run was starting to do the same

1108
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:00,719
thing and i'm like you know what

1109
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:06,160
i

1110
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:06,159
i've admittedly never checked my soil ph

1111
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,880
until this week because i was like i've

1112
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,480
always been told it'll just balance

1113
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,760
itself out

1114
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,480
while

1115
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,400
i

1116
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,960
checked on my beginning balance for my

1117
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,200
unbalance and it looks like it creeped

1118
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,800
up it must have creeped up because i

1119
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:24,319
wasn't pha

1120
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,280
um so

1121
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:30,160
for me i don't know if it's so much of

1122
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,640
ph in your water but making sure your

1123
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:36,639
soil ph is on

1124
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:39,440
so if your soil ph is too high then you

1125
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:40,639
should be ph in your water lower

1126
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,480
um so

1127
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:43,920
if i just feel like you should just be

1128
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,240
checking your soil ph because it's

1129
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,358
something that i hadn't been doing and i

1130
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:52,078
know i'm rookie mistake

1131
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:54,159
but it's it's a real thing and i've had

1132
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,960
to actually learn that the hard way i

1133
00:38:54,159 --> 00:39:00,159
hear a lot of people saying ignore ph

1134
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,240
when it comes to organic as well but

1135
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:04,719
really your your water source has to do

1136
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:07,439
with it has a lot to do with it i mean i

1137
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:09,679
fell in the same trap ignore ph

1138
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,320
and when i was growing organic my water

1139
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:15,679
sources at 7.5 ph so i was putting 7.5

1140
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,760
ph water going in and my soil ph drifted

1141
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:19,598
up over time and it was a lack of

1142
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,119
nutrient uptake because the ph was so

1143
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,240
high i know some people

1144
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,358
had their water sources like over 8 ph

1145
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,598
it's like

1146
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:29,119
yeah mine actually fluctuates throughout

1147
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,200
the year in the winter it's different

1148
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,000
from the summertime in my area so i'm

1149
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:35,759
not sure if that's um for every area but

1150
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,159
i feel like

1151
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:41,520
at least checking your ph and making

1152
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:45,039
sure it's in a certain range yeah and um

1153
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:47,358
but your soil ph is i feel like the most

1154
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:48,800
important yeah i've always had best luck

1155
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:50,319
you know adjusting the the ph of my

1156
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,359
water making sure it's you know within

1157
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,400
the

1158
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:56,880
you know 6.0 6.5 range if it's on the

1159
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,720
non cocoa i usually go 5.8 and then i'll

1160
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,960
i'll water in but there are things in

1161
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,559
the soil that's gonna adjust the ph as

1162
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,519
well right the microbes can adjust the

1163
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:07,759
ph the plant can release acids that can

1164
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:10,559
increase the th for example with iron

1165
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,200
for example if the ph is so high the

1166
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,400
plant will release acids to lower the ph

1167
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:16,480
so then it will be able to actually

1168
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,240
intake iron so

1169
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,480
you know there are several different

1170
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:22,479
things in the soil i didn't know

1171
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,240
something i learned quite recently

1172
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,519
from a scientist actually so that's

1173
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:27,759
awesome

1174
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,679
right that is amazing and i mean they

1175
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,640
got to survive yeah

1176
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:32,399
yeah so

1177
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,719
so there are things beyond just your

1178
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,720
your water source

1179
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:40,639
of ph that's going to adjust the actual

1180
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:42,639
ph in the medium so how about ppm or ec

1181
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:44,799
are other measurements that growers

1182
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:46,400
commonly make do you do it on the

1183
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,240
synthetic side of things

1184
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,800
yeah the floor flex schedule does have

1185
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:52,639
like a recommended ec for each stage too

1186
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,000
so it gives you not only like how much

1187
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:56,559
you should be weighing and adding to

1188
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,800
your water per gallon um what you see it

1189
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:00,799
should come out to so you know i've been

1190
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,480
i have an ec meter i have a ph meter of

1191
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,039
course i'm checking i still even though

1192
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,599
it's always been like within that 6 to

1193
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:09,440
six point five range easily just just

1194
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,280
straight mixing it right out of the tap

1195
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,880
i still been checking the ph anyways

1196
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,960
just because i'm still always curious if

1197
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,240
there's a drift um and the ec's always

1198
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,639
been pretty much

1199
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:20,719
bang on with what they suggest so i've

1200
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,239
i've literally just been you know i i

1201
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,559
feel confident enough now with the auto

1202
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:26,959
watering system like i can just do the

1203
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:29,279
recommended amounts with

1204
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:32,240
my straight tap water and

1205
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,920
it should just basically be maintaining

1206
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:36,399
unless i don't i the one thing i haven't

1207
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,240
tested is like long terms like mix it up

1208
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,160
let it sit for a week like if i'm gonna

1209
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:42,559
mix up a bucket for a week's worth of

1210
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:44,799
watering at a time like is the ph gonna

1211
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,400
drift over time in that bucket yeah i'm

1212
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,839
gonna measure it and figure out if it's

1213
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,599
doing that because then i'll have to

1214
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,838
maintain basically a mini i don't want a

1215
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,160
huge reservoir i just want enough to get

1216
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:55,838
me at least like four or five days in

1217
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:58,399
case i'm at heaven's house or we're like

1218
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:59,440
going to chicago for cannafest like

1219
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,559
i want to make sure everything's not

1220
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,559
going to die

1221
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,599
you know

1222
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:05,279
yeah

1223
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,680
that's like that's a great experiment

1224
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,680
i'm actually i'm into that yeah but from

1225
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:12,000
what i've seen it seems to maintain

1226
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:15,358
heaven do you do the monitoring of ppm

1227
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
or ec at all when growing organic

1228
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:18,880
never no never

1229
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,280
i don't even think so it's very

1230
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,160
hands-off i just find that

1231
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,519
if your ph is on um

1232
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:28,399
if the plant

1233
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:30,639
is healthy um it's gonna it's gonna take

1234
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,880
what it needs yeah there's a there's

1235
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:34,239
definitely something to uh less is more

1236
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,400
especially with autos and you're just

1237
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:38,318
learning it's easy to get into that's

1238
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,079
there for it to take it's easy to get

1239
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:41,920
into that too much love syndrome where

1240
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,680
you're just trying to do too much at

1241
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,680
once like with an auto like if you're

1242
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:47,279
new just like take it easy like you know

1243
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:49,279
if you're using bag nudes from the store

1244
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,839
and you're getting some fox farm like

1245
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,599
you know just water that baby

1246
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:55,599
the first like you're gonna at least get

1247
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,000
to four or five weeks on just that you

1248
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,519
know don't go crazy you know it's easy

1249
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,358
to get out of control and get in there

1250
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:02,480
and start wanting to add stuff and do

1251
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:04,239
this and

1252
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,519
you know i completely agree yeah it's

1253
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:07,279
definitely when you have that bagged

1254
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,519
soil that's enriched with nutrients it

1255
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,280
can be a lot easier and then you know

1256
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,440
you definitely don't have to feed

1257
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,119
right away for sure

1258
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,240
let's let's switch it up let's talk

1259
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,400
about harvesting autos i know there's

1260
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,318
quite a few people that struggle to

1261
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,358
identify when the plant is ready to

1262
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:25,759
harvest

1263
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:27,920
what do you both do when it comes to

1264
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,640
harvesting autos like how do you know

1265
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,639
when to harvest

1266
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,480
well

1267
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:38,318
we have a saying 84 out the door so

1268
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,679
i mean that's really our general

1269
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:42,159
timeline we're not going to say that

1270
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:43,118
every plant's at 84 days you chop in

1271
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:44,960
like that

1272
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,640
it's more of it's more of a guideline

1273
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,760
than an actual rule

1274
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:51,440
um

1275
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,640
but we i mean just like any photo

1276
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,880
really yeah we're looking at the

1277
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:58,000
trichomes we're looking for usually

1278
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,079
around 15 to 25 amber it just kind of

1279
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,239
depends on the plant what we're feeling

1280
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,760
for it how how the whole plant's looking

1281
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,838
but definitely we want to make sure the

1282
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,920
trichomes are cloudy we've found if we

1283
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:09,679
chop it when they're too clear just ends

1284
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,200
up being like you get more of a jittery

1285
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,358
effect um

1286
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:15,519
than what we're looking for so we just

1287
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:18,000
find like at least i like a little bit

1288
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:20,318
cloudier with some amber definitely not

1289
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,719
just on the very top buds but like

1290
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:24,480
throughout the plant yeah

1291
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:26,639
but we found most autos seem to take you

1292
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,960
gotta look at the tricom i've spoke to

1293
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:30,078
somebody recently talking about autos in

1294
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,920
particular and he brought up something i

1295
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,599
thought was very interesting he had

1296
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,639
mentioned that with autos in particular

1297
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:39,440
he found that some genetics don't really

1298
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:41,838
amber up takes extendedly long time

1299
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,440
bananas will shoot out prior have you

1300
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:45,119
come across that in any of the autos

1301
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,960
that you've grown where it's just it's

1302
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,200
not turning to amber although the plant

1303
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,599
looks like it's done

1304
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:53,358
um not really i don't think i've seen

1305
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,519
that either with the genetics that we've

1306
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:57,920
grown i mean we've had the banana and

1307
00:44:55,519 --> 00:45:00,000
then like bananas and stuff but i think

1308
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,760
that was more or less you know running

1309
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,480
it too long yeah

1310
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,680
and not even just running it too long i

1311
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,079
the the light situation wasn't great the

1312
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,799
you know humidity situation wasn't great

1313
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,519
at the time when we had experienced this

1314
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,000
so

1315
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:17,759
i'm not sure if that had anything to do

1316
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,199
with it or some feeding issues we could

1317
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,800
have been doing like stress will cause

1318
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:22,879
them to herm and

1319
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,800
manner and i've definitely definitely

1320
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,720
probably stressed some one from a ph

1321
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,720
issue from a pen that was way out of

1322
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:30,879
whack uh and that was my own fault for

1323
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:32,399
not uh preventative and like calibrating

1324
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,480
it but you know

1325
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,480
autos are susceptible to that kind of

1326
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,559
stuff heavy stresses because they are in

1327
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,159
that race to the finish like they're

1328
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:42,719
just trying to survive and they're just

1329
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:45,199
like on a beeline to the end so but as

1330
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:47,679
far as the flower itself um i think it's

1331
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:50,239
just like you know any photo flower you

1332
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:53,199
look at it i mean if you look at an

1333
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:54,879
autoflower versus a photo flower i mean

1334
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:56,799
if you're not looking at the entire

1335
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,318
plant i don't know if you'd be able to

1336
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,680
tell the difference

1337
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:01,039
okay that makes sense i just figured i'd

1338
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,318
bring that up because i heard like i

1339
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:03,440
said i heard that from somebody else i

1340
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:05,759
thought it was super interesting so i

1341
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,838
figured i'd talk to somebody who has uh

1342
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,520
probably grown more autoflowers than me

1343
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:12,239
i've only grown probably about two dozen

1344
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:14,559
autoflowers total so i don't have that

1345
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:17,199
much experience with with autoflowers uh

1346
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:18,639
but i i hadn't heard that before

1347
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:20,078
i yeah i've grown a lot more than this

1348
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:21,279
can't wait to see you do them at these

1349
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,400
tails and see what you think of them

1350
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,880
because we think they're pretty

1351
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,318
impressive yeah should be awesome

1352
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,079
light cycle

1353
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:30,318
what light cycle are you typically using

1354
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:33,920
for auto some people do an 1860 some

1355
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:36,559
people doing 24 some people are doing no

1356
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,680
darkness 24 hours on and no hours of

1357
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:39,759
darkness

1358
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:42,559
have you do you stick to one light cycle

1359
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,240
or you've tried several or what well

1360
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:48,239
neil's tried a couple different kinds of

1361
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:49,439
light cycles i've always done 18 six

1362
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,719
it's always just kind of been a

1363
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:55,358
no-brainer to me because i don't

1364
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:58,239
autos don't thrive it's been proven they

1365
00:46:55,358 --> 00:47:00,880
don't thrive about anything more or i'm

1366
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:01,919
sorry less than 18 hours of light

1367
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,119
um but

1368
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,800
[Music]

1369
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,240
so it was a no-brainer for me to just do

1370
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,800
that because

1371
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,679
obviously electric costs money

1372
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,000
so

1373
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:14,000
yeah um so i just started out with that

1374
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,159
but neil's tried different life cycles

1375
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,480
yeah i pretty much since i started so

1376
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,239
when when like the two by four videos

1377
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,240
started like early on in our channel

1378
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:24,639
like that was basically the grows at my

1379
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:26,159
house uh and i started with the 24

1380
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:29,519
because i was like oh more light more

1381
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:31,519
yields yeah you know and uh but honestly

1382
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:32,800
after like a year of doing that and just

1383
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:34,639
seeing what was coming out of heaven's

1384
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,119
tent running 18 6 and then seeing what

1385
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:39,039
was coming out of my tent in 24 i felt

1386
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,640
like there was no there was no real

1387
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:42,000
difference like i didn't see any

1388
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:43,519
substantial difference between the

1389
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,760
yields from her plants and the yields

1390
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:48,318
for mine so i'm like well what's four

1391
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,880
hours more or you know whatever amount

1392
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:53,759
of time rest for the plants you know

1393
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,760
lower electric bill and um you know if i

1394
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,359
was to tell somebody new like just go

1395
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,280
18-6 because you're going to be making

1396
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:00,799
mistakes you're not going to be like so

1397
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,319
good at growing that you're maxing out

1398
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,760
this plant's genetics and potential

1399
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:06,719
where you could actually maybe see that

1400
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:09,680
a yield difference um i feel like you

1401
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:11,118
know 18 6 unless you're really killing

1402
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:12,719
it or you're a really good grower you're

1403
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,400
probably not going to notice anything if

1404
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:17,598
you if you're a really good grower then

1405
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,119
you should already know the answers

1406
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,559
yeah

1407
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:25,440
i gotta agree with you i think there's

1408
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:26,319
18 six generally i've tried both 24 0 18

1409
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,599
6

1410
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:30,800
24 uh light cycles and i didn't see much

1411
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,400
of a difference except for my

1412
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,440
electricity bill which was which was

1413
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,680
higher with

1414
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,960
yeah exactly yeah my personal opinion it

1415
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:38,239
wasn't worth it but i'm sure there's

1416
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,720
people that are gonna comment on this

1417
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:42,879
video and say what you kidding me

1418
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:45,519
24-0 i got

1419
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,599
24 hours yeah i totally got four more

1420
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:49,119
ounces and maybe you know maybe they did

1421
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,200
like i feel like some of these people in

1422
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,760
this deep water culture that can just

1423
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,118
make these plants go crazy like yeah you

1424
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,800
probably would see a better yield

1425
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,400
because you're you're nailing it you

1426
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,480
know but like

1427
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,230
it's gonna feel the same way with co2

1428
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:06,079
though by the way yes

1429
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:07,679
[Laughter]

1430
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,200
yeah i mean there's so much more that we

1431
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:11,598
could talk about but we're going to kind

1432
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:14,000
of wrap things up here i did want to get

1433
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,000
some just general advice from you too

1434
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,318
for the folks that are beginners growing

1435
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
auto flowers right what general advice

1436
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:22,400
do you have for folks that are that are

1437
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,039
just getting started with autos

1438
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:28,000
just know that

1439
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:30,480
when you make mistakes just treat it as

1440
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,199
a learning experience because when

1441
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:36,079
you're growing auto flowers

1442
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:37,439
and i'll say it forever but you're on a

1443
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,480
timeline

1444
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,318
so

1445
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:44,880
that is always something you have to

1446
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:47,358
consider so when you're growing autos um

1447
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,400
just take every experience as a learning

1448
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:53,039
experience and move on and just know

1449
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,920
that you you can if you can do it i can

1450
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:58,719
do it i'll just say that yeah

1451
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,960
i'm i'm sorry i'm high if i can do it

1452
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:02,399
you can hide again

1453
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,000
i don't know i feel like it's such a

1454
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,280
it's a crazy question but if you're new

1455
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,358
and you're thinking about getting into

1456
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,359
it like you're obviously going to be

1457
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:10,880
leaning towards like you know some

1458
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:12,719
certain style of growing because

1459
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,318
basically you know everybody has their

1460
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:16,159
own way of growing and you won't know

1461
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:18,400
until you grow so just

1462
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:20,318
start doing something and figure it out

1463
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,318
along the way like community is amazing

1464
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:23,440
it's super fun it's a fun hobby anything

1465
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:24,719
you got to start somewhere yep and

1466
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,318
you're pretty much always going to end

1467
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:27,759
up with something you know and it's

1468
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:30,800
always going to be better every time so

1469
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,800
