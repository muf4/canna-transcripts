1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,760
coming up on garden talk we are

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,480
continuing to add

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,039
diversity um as we build up these worm

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,559
bins

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,039
and then of course anything that's

6
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,798
organic matter that soil food web is

7
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,039
going to break that down into

8
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,719
carbon and carbon is basically like the

9
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:17,198
currency if you will of the soil food

10
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,879
web

11
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,560
you know if you're not monitoring the

12
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,239
temperatures you can basically ruin

13
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,239
maybe a couple weeks to a couple months

14
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,358
worth of work so that's very frustrating

15
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,000
when you first start out

16
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,118
he knows to poop and pee in the worm bin

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,719
so i have

18
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:34,719
probably 15 100 gallon worm bins

19
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,759
down in my basement i focus on

20
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,840
freeze-dried

21
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,439
corn and it has to be freeze-dried

22
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,600
that's how it still has the nutrients in

23
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,519
it non-gmo obviously organic and then

24
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,399
the main secret ingredient that i feel

25
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,280
when you're really

26
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,640
focusing on getting worms to breed other

27
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,520
than avocado tech

28
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,520
is focusing on

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,280
what's up everybody if you that don't

30

and focuses on educating the gardening

40
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,520
community from living soil systems

41
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,960
vermiculture beneficial insects and more

42
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,000
in this episode we talk about making

43
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,719
worm castings

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,560
and vermicompost by utilizing worm bins

45
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,640
we also get a little bit into beneficial

46
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,159
insects which can be in worm bins as

47
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,759
well as living soil systems

104
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,680
podcast today i am joined with brian

105
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,238
wassmann how are you doing today

106
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,519
i'm doing will sir appreciate the invite

i'm super excited to have you on today

109
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,599
you know a lot about vermiculture

110
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,680
vermicomposting and that's really what

111
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,238
we're going to get into today so

112
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,680
i'm actually brand new to it i wanted to

113
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,200
get a worm bin going

114
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,200
i kind of have in my plans but i haven't

115
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,598
yet pulled the trigger yet there's some

116
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,399
research that i need to do before i go

117
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:34,639
about that

118
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,439
but hoping to learn some things from you

119
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,958
today that

120
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,639
will allow me to pull that trigger and

121
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,360
get going and

122
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,399
so my audience actually is more towards

123
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,480
the beginner slash

124
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,439
intermediate side of things and we

125
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,840
haven't covered that

126
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,120
topic at all on this channel so i'm

127
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,920
going to be learning right along with my

128
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,400
audience today

129
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,000
so excellent well you know it's really

130
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,680
all about building soil so it doesn't

131
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,438
really matter what you're farming

132
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,120
as long as you understand the soil food

133
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,000
web as long as you continue to educate

134
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,319
yourself on

135
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,318
how to build soil systems how to make

136
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,839
them become alive and thriving

137
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,438
that's really the end goal of whatever

138
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,360
you decide to farm

139
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,799
and so the one of the main secrets i'm

140
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,159
going to kind of talk about today and

141
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,719
you'll see for yourself

142
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,238
is that composting worms use um their

143
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,918
hermaphrodites and as soon as they touch

144
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,000
each other they want to reproduce

145
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,279
and once they really uh ball up like a

146
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,120
gumball effect

147
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,399
that creates what's known as biofilm so

148
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,439
they're going to create all that biofilm

149
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,198
and then once that

150
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,639
organic matter is broken down they're

151
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,199
going to continue through that soil

152
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,600
system

153
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,759
and basically you know start to build

154
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,120
and dig those dissolved oxygen channels

155
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,360
which is really what you're after when

156
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,439
you're a soil farmer gotcha

157
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,639
so before we get too deep into things

158
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,918
can you just tell us a little bit about

159
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,560
yourself and kind of how you got into

160
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:44,879
gardening

161
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,160
yeah absolutely my name is brian

162
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,120
walksman i'm from

163
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,080
uh basically grew up in atlanta georgia

164
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,560
i feel like i

165
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,758
became a man in savannah georgia really

166
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,800
started to learn a lot about

167
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,080
just plants in general i was you know

168
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,840
trying to make a

169
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,439
small living for myself trying to do

170
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,799
things i got a

171
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,478
you know really it's almost like

172
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
whatever i want to try to do

173
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,800
that i feel like i can make money with i

174
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,439
focused on and at that time

175
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,199
online poker was really big so i got

176
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:16,160
really deep into that started to

177
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,038
be able to provide a a decent life for

178
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,000
myself

179
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,360
i moved to colorado continued to kind of

180
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,478
hone those skills

181
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,800
and then april 15 2011

182
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,319
uh the government shut all that down um

183
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,919
and so i

184
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,159
foolishly i guess thought that i was

185
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,799
going to do that for the rest of my life

186
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,400
um definitely it wasn't as it wasn't

187
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,400
glamorous or anything like that i didn't

188
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,599
have the skill set to be a glamorous

189
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,279
poker player but

190
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,280
um playing online and stuff allowed me

191
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,279
to at least work from home if you will

192
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,799
uh that kind of thing so when that was

193
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,038
taken away from me they also

194
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,199
froze the funds that you had in your

195
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,519
account so i had a full tilt account

196
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,960
an ultimate bet account like absolute

197
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,839
kind of same thing absolute poker

198
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,239
account

199
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,279
and when those were frozen i really had

200
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,759
no other skill set

201
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,038
i hadn't graduated from college or

202
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,560
anything so

203
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:08,159
the only really um you know where am i

204
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,079
going to go from here is when i started

205
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,199
to study soil sciences and that's when i

206
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,839
actually started to

207
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,038
learn about people like dr elaine ingham

208
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,359
from that i learned

209
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,079
about a guy named jeff lowenfels he's

210
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,759
wrote

211
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,359
you know three books that i feel like

212
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,960
you know your audience should definitely

213
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,160
view as like a blueprint for

214
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,918
understanding things

215
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,680
um and it's simple to remember teaming

216
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,879
with microbes teaming with nutrients and

217
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,478
teaming with fungi

218
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,319
i would personally recommend especially

219
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,279
if you're new to this uh to just read

220
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,000
the teaming with

221
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,519
microbes book then in my opinion read

222
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,279
the teaming with fungi book the third

223
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,918
book and then come back to his second

224
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,719
book

225
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,478
because that one for me as far as being

226
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,160
educated in georgia

227
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:47,758
that book was a little hard for me so i

228
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,680
felt like if you can understand concepts

229
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,439
and maybe see some more verbage

230
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,038
that you recognize that second book's

231
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,199
going to be a little bit easier

232
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,199
so yeah i was kind of forced into

233
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,160
understanding

234
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,080
our new path at least because yeah the

235
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,240
government literally shut it down on

236
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:08,800
tax day uh 2011. so let's start with

237
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,400
kind of the basics what is vermiculture

238
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,240
and what is vermont composting

239
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,519
so vermiculture is basically you know

240
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,280
you're going out of your way

241
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,879
to make sure that there really are no

242
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,758
mistakes so instead of

243
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,680
composting yourself what's also kind of

244
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,160
known as hot composting

245
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,840
vermiculture is a simple definition as

246
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,599
you're using composting worms to break

247
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,758
down organic matter

248
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,279
and one of the easiest ways to do that

249
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,960
is in my opinion using

250
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,638
four different composting worms i'm

251
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,239
going to get into that in a minute

252
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,918
but that really is kind of the basic and

253
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,120
then really get into vermic

254
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:43,279
from a cast which is worm castings

255
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,879
vermiculture all that kind of stuff to

256
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,318
me just really means that we're using

257
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,400
composting worms

258
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,520
in conjunction with other things in the

259
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,839
soil food web

260
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,120
uh springtail mites rogue beetles again

261
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,399
we're going to get into all that stuff

262
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,120
but we're using a

263
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,079
symbiotic relationship most things in

264
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,160
mother nature that

265
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,519
are beneficial are going to work in

266
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,439
harmony with one another

267
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,560
so as long as we understand creating

268
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,120
diversity

269
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,079
and we really focus on moving things

270
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,680
kind of more

271
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,199
towards as best we can especially in an

272
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,079
indoor environment to the old growth

273
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,160
forest

274
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,758
the easier it's going to be for us as a

275
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,160
farmer so pretty much

276
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,879
like the end goal for this process would

277
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,919
be to

278
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,240
obtain either vermicompost or like a

279
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,839
worm castings is that right and how much

280
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,800
can you like how long does this process

281
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,878
actually take

282
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,199
uh so when we're getting into the worm

283
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,158
castings that really is the the black

284
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,320
gold if you will

285
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,679
um when we're farming that's kind of the

286
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,240
stuff that can change

287
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,838
it's an inoculant in my opinion uh yes

288
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,839
it provides nutrients but that's not

289
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,240
necessarily what we're after

290
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,440
we're just after viewing it as an

291
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,080
inoculation

292
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,600
and so you know the large fields like if

293
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,560
you're a

294
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,560
major manufacturer of a warm farm you

295
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,759
know a million worms is probably doing

296
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,479
700 pounds of worm castings every single

297
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:00,559
day

298
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,920
to bring that down to scale for the you

299
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,278
know for the rest of us that are doing

300
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:04,240
this in our basements and that kind of

301
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,320
stuff

302
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,680
in the backyard you're going to need

303
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,360
about 2 000

304
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,958
of those composting worms and when i say

305
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,639
composting worms i'm usually referring

306
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,799
to red wigglers with these numbers

307
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,480
they have to be optimal conditions but

308
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,559
they're going to create about seven

309
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,480
pounds every month for you

310
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,159
so in my opinion you need to kind of

311
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,839
start with at least 2 000

312
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:25,919
again in optimal conditions they're

313
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,320
going to completely double their

314
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:31,199
population every 90 days

315
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,879
so that extra 1000 that you buy in my

316
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,759
opinion is worth it since it'll go to

317
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,039
basically two

318
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,480
four eight um and not you know with math

319
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,958
i feel like buying that extra thousand

320
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,360
if you

321
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,319
if you can get maybe four thousand uh to

322
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,399
start

323
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,080
that's really where i guess basically

324
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,000
it's how quickly are you wanting to

325
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,680
quote unquote by time

326
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,200
because once you've purchased composting

327
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,278
worms you're never going to have to

328
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,720
purchase those again as long as you uh

329
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,439
maintain the system

330
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,440
okay so to start the process really i

331
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,360
think starting with the container

332
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,120
you know like i mentioned a lot of my

333
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,680
growers a lot of the people who tuned in

334
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,679
to me are

335
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,639
more home growth side of things so i'm

336
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:08,239
assuming they're going to be working in

337
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,679
small containers i know you're probably

338
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
more of like a larger container type

339
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,838
thing

340
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,000
can you tell us like what container size

341
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,560
you use for it and then also what you

342
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,360
recommend

343
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,958
for someone who's new to use absolutely

344
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,879
and i i want to kind of set this

345
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,399
i feel like i've tried a variety of

346
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,320
different things when you google

347
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,320
they talk about how cheaply you can do

348
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,959
stuff with plastic tubs

349
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,079
i haven't had the success that you're

350
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,679
going to need

351
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,120
as a farmer if you're really trying to

352
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,319
create optimal

353
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,200
um goals with your composting uh worms

354
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,760
and that kind of stuff

355
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,560
you're going to need a fabric pot in my

356
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,720
opinion

357
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,078
so that i go you know i basically view

358
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,240
that as the stomach

359
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,199
that is the stomach of the soil food web

360
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,720
uh the reason why

361
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,079
we are building that up is because we

362
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,920
are trying to create what's known as the

363
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:52,958
rhizosphere it's just a fancy word for

364
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,039
where all those

365
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,159
uh roots and exudates are feeding that

366
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,039
soil system

367
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:01,199
um and to really have that um you know

368
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,120
be a thriving and

369
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,519
have it come alive and become thriving

370
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,120
you need to have plenty of oxygen

371
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,639
and so that's why i feel like fabric

372
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,240
pots are where it's at now

373
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,919
since i mentioned that it's a stomach i

374
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,440
would say that the minimal

375
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,278
um if you're going to do this in my

376
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,440
opinion correctly with the

377
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,360
the amount of volume that you're trying

378
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,160
to get then i would say that a 20 gallon

379
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,039
fabric pot

380
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,919
should be minimal that's easy to move

381
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,240
you know

382
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,000
relatively and as things start to build

383
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,159
up you can continue to inoculate

384
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,039
other pots and that kind of stuff so if

385
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,120
you wanted to

386
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,519
maybe have smaller pots i would just say

387
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,440
consider your 20 gallon as your mother

388
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,560
if you're really into this or you know

389
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,680
you're using this to

390
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:43,278
continue to improve your overall garden

391
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,519
then you're going to want to go to what

392
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,559
i have in my basement which is several

393
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,720
hundred gallon

394
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,399
pots and the reason that i'm doing that

395
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,959
is because i it takes a long time to

396
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,039
create

397
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,559
create those castings especially if you

398
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,399
start with two thousand worms

399
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:57,919
in a 100 gallon pot that's going to

400
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,360
probably take you a year before that

401
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,039
really starts to churn

402
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,680
so again it's how quickly do you want

403
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,599
things uh to take hold and if you have

404
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,838
time and you don't have a lot of money

405
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,278
that's where you know just understanding

406
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,639
and being proactive and

407
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,000
you know if you're if you're starting a

408
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,360
little project and you know that's three

409
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,958
months down the road this is something

410
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,639
that i always tell um

411
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,399
consulting clients as well as our

412
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,320
audience and that kind of thing is

413
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,679
be so proactive that the first thing you

414
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,920
do before you even start to

415
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,958
you know set up your tent or build your

416
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,078
your grow out

417
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,919
uh or or focus on your backyard farm

418
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,359
is to get that that worm bin going so

419
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:35,039
that you have your fresh

420
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,039
uh you know what went into worm castings

421
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,799
all right so for those that are new

422
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:40,639
they've got their 20 gallon container or

423
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,000
whatever size they're using

424
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,839
what's the starting material what do

425
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,720
they put in there to begin yeah so i

426
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,160
actually um

427
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,440
i wanted to make sure that i had this so

428
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,120
i have this in front of me so that you

429
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,560
guys can have a blueprint that i feel

430
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,839
like for a beginner

431
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,159
this is where it's at in my opinion

432
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,040
this has come from a lot of research

433
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,199
over the years

434
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,159
and again this is in my opinion very

435
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,440
basic so

436
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,919
this is something where you can start

437
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,600
out kind of see how your system

438
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:07,039
becomes alive and thriving and then you

439
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,879
can continue on and

440
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,240
try to understand more about natural

441
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,200
farming techniques or

442
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,720
biodynamic farming living soil you know

443
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,920
there's a variety of different like

444
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,000
tentacles that come

445
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,039
from that main octopus of organic

446
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,440
farming

447
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,120
and so when i would focus on this uh the

448
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,959
base that i personally like to do is i

449
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,159
like to get the lava rocks

450
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,199
that's something that i feel like you

451
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,639
know especially when you're building

452
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,680
these up this is something that's going

453
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,480
to

454
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,799
pretty much last forever so i take that

455
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,039
uh

456
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,958
lava rock again this is you know i'm

457
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,799
doing this cheap and basic

458
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,198
there's this stuff called pit moss if

459
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,679
money isn't an issue for you that

460
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,278
ethically is better than canadians

461
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,319
phagnum peat moss

462
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:49,919
but again that stuff is really cheap you

463
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,720
can actually get an organic if it comes

464
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:52,399
from canada

465
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,839
as far as i understand all of that is

466
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,440
organic um so

467
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,040
if you go to lowe's there's a bunch of

468
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,560
compressed bricks and that kind of stuff

469
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,120
that you can get for extremely cheap

470
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,039
like 11

471
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,879
12 bucks and that's going to last you

472
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,039
probably months

473
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,480
so i will take that canadian sphagnum

474
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,958
peat moss and then you kind of lightly

475
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,519
cover

476
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,198
all of that lava rock on that next layer

477
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,959
i'm i'm focusing on bri

478
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:14,799
kind of bringing back that old growth

479
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,679
forest again how do we

480
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:20,240
in a way kind of set the tone with that

481
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,638
i like to use that alaskan hummus

482
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,079
it doesn't really matter what brand just

483
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,560
using that older

484
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,159
alaskan humus and then i will again

485
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,479
drizzle that over

486
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,240
if again money isn't an object i might

487
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,000
buy two or three of those bags

488
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,680
um if you're just kind of starting out

489
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,198
one will get you by but again

490
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:40,159
it's time that's going to really get

491
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:42,000
everything churning um then i will

492
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:43,519
basically start with like a light food

493
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,799
layer for the

494
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,679
the worms that we're going to start to

495
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,240
build up so i focus on coral calcium for

496
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,359
that

497
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,120
i focus on freeze-dried corn and it has

498
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,480
to be freeze-dried that's how it still

499
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,120
has the nutrients in it

500
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,120
non-gmo obviously organic and then the

501
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,320
main secret ingredient that i feel when

502
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,198
you're really

503
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,560
focusing on getting worms to breed other

504
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,439
than avocado tech

505
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,359
is focusing on nutritional yeast so that

506
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,160
is a tried and true secret that i have

507
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,199
found

508
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:15,919
that just seems to be a cheap um

509
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,838
overall feed instead of having to buy

510
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,439
like the expensive worm chow and worm

511
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,279
food and that kind of stuff

512
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,560
in my opinion it's extremely overpriced

513
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:24,559
compared to

514
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,479
mixing up your own nutritional yeast

515
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:27,838
fried street freeze-dried corn

516
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,839
and then a little bit of that coral

517
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,199
calcium and again calcium is really

518
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,240
what's going to get those

519
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:36,000
composting worms to be able to reproduce

520
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,600
so then after i've laid that i missed

521
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,919
what's known as

522
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,639
sunshine in a bottle or it's a bio ag

523
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:42,958
product

524
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,480
full power again that's a tried and true

525
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,758
secret that i feel like to kind of get

526
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,240
everything going

527
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,440
that's a light mist again this is you

528
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,639
don't want to go overboard with this

529
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,839
kind of stuff especially when you're

530
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,519
starting things that you know

531
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,040
and setting things up so again just a

532
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,078
light mist with that

533
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,679
and then i will cover all of that again

534
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:00,239
with a little bit of that sphagnum peat

535
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,239
moss

536
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,919
and then my first worms come in which

537
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,278
are known as the alabama jumpers the

538
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,399
georgia jumpers

539
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,078
those are the ones that are going to be

540
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,600
deeper into that system they're going

541
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,278
for the most part to be able to stay

542
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,040
down into that system

543
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,720
these are fabulous also if you're really

544
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,039
trying to break things down

545
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,639
they go through clay like butter and

546
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:19,919
these are you know i would say i've only

547
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,000
been really playing around with these

548
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,159
for maybe a year and a half to two years

549
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
so it's still something new they are an

550
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,360
invasive species so

551
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,879
for people that are concerned about that

552
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,240
again we're just doing this in our warm

553
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,159
bins and you know

554
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,519
inside i wouldn't be releasing this

555
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,600
stuff outside

556
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,560
and then once everything starts to kind

557
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,560
of settle in

558
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:41,838
i would really focus to keep things

559
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:44,719
cheap around 300 to 500 of those

560
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,199
alabama georgia jumpers then i will add

561
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,278
the

562
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,198
pumice and the rice holes again i feel

563
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:50,799
like that is a tried and true secret

564
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,359
with perlite if you're adding stuff like

565
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:55,838
that or vermiculite or

566
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,360
god forbid vermiculite kind of stuff

567
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,399
especially perlite that's going to start

568
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,639
to float to the

569
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,078
to the top over time i feel like a lot

570
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,640
of the older

571
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,480
farmers older heads have known that from

572
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,759
experience so when you're using perlite

573
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,120
to me it's kind of silly because that

574
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,359
stuff's going to go up

575
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,719
if you're focused on you know building

576
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,639
beds building raised

577
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,160
raised beds especially or building these

578
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,319
worm bins that you know

579
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,360
you want to can you know hold on to for

580
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:22,558
years and years on

581
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,000
on end pearlite is silly so again it's

582
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:25,359
that pumice it's the rice holes that are

583
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,240
going to break that down

584
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,839
and then i'm going to add um what are

585
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,279
known as the european nightcrawlers or

586
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,720
the african nightcrawlers

587
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,399
those are a little bit different the

588
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,919
european night crawlers are a thicker

589
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,840
worm bigger worm

590
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,200
also because of that it feels like it's

591
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:40,798
a slower

592
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,558
worm for like breeding and that kind of

593
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:45,839
stuff in my experience

594
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:47,678
so i use those mainly to build larger

595
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,918
dissolved oxygen channels

596
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,038
so again probably about three to five

597
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,559
hundred of those

598
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:53,759
now with the african nightcrawlers

599
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,440
they're kind of like a nice little

600
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,038
hybrid between the red wigglers and the

601
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,000
european nightcrawlers

602
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,480
so i really focus on having the majority

603
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,640
of

604
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,160
kind of in that middle section of

605
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,520
african night crawlers over the

606
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,600
europeans

607
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,960
over the europeans just because of uh

608
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:10,399
the speed and everything that the

609
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,079
africans can kind of take off i feel

610
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,720
like it's more of like a

611
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,399
a sportier version of a composting worm

612
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,519
um and then once everything is kind of

613
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,759
building up and layering out

614
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,759
again i feel like a real secret is to

615
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:27,038
kind of go more to

616
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:30,480
leaves twigs sticks and if you put that

617
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:32,319
in the oven for 200 at 200 degrees for

618
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,599
around 20 minutes 30 minutes maybe to be

619
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,879
safe

620
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,119
you're going to kill anything that could

621
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,000
potentially be in there i have found

622
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:39,759
that

623
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
worms especially really like to break

624
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,519
down oak leaves and magnolia leaves

625
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,679
so that's something that i personally

626
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,359
will spend a little bit of money on

627
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,440
if i'm trying to speed things up it just

628
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,759
seems to be like another one of those

629
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,519
little secret sauce and then once those

630
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,480
magnolia leaves once the oak leaves are

631
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,240
starting to get in there

632
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,679
i will add kind of the basic stuff that

633
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,400
you've always heard

634
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,798
newspaper egg cartons kind of building

635
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,360
up

636
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,319
um the brown manure kind of thing tree

637
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,759
bark

638
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,279
and again this is kind of layering

639
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:08,558
things out but it doesn't have to be an

640
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,759
exact science

641
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,480
they're going to churn all this stuff

642
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:13,038
anyway so it's kind of silly to sit out

643
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,599
and

644
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:16,720
um you know and i encourage you guys to

645
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:18,159
make more than one

646
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,160
one of these like if you're going to do

647
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,440
a 20 gallon then make three 20 gallons

648
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,400
and kind of see how

649
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,080
wow these the processes are going to be

650
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,679
different for each one of those and then

651
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,359
if you continue to farm and you want to

652
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,640
improve your skill sets and then

653
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,719
you know one day you maybe get to a

654
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,559
large commercial level that's going to

655
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,519
really come in handy when you understand

656
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,720
how to improve a sluggish soil system

657
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,879
because you've been worn

658
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,720
warm farming for all these years and

659
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,200
then once that starts to take hold

660
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,440
again i will kind of just finish off and

661
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,000
and maybe about three to four inches of

662
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,320
that canadian sphagnum peat moss again

663
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,200
that's just a cheap

664
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,720
a cheap medium if you will to start to

665
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,240
build those things up and then of course

666
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,839
of course those composting worms in time

667
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,038
are going to break all of that down into

668
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:05,678
to castings and then at the top

669
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,640
is really the the secret sauce for just

670
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,200
life in general

671
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,400
you know most of the the the real action

672
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,319
that's going on

673
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,559
with the soil food web is probably

674
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,839
between the one inch to four inch range

675
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:17,119
and that's where

676
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,639
the red wigglers those are the

677
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:19,678
composting worms that most people have

678
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,200
probably heard of

679
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,720
anytime you google anything and it's

680
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,319
talking about composting worms

681
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,839
that's usually the variety that they're

682
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:29,599
talking about and

683
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,599
they're not as ferocious

684
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:33,038
you know as long as you maintain

685
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,639
population so again you don't want to

686
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:36,240
get crazy with this and if something for

687
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,600
whatever reason did get out of control

688
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,919
for the most part they will

689
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,279
self-regulate uh but it's it's pretty

690
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,440
easy to also

691
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,038
uh like i'll talk later with avocado

692
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,640
tech is to be able to get the worms to

693
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:48,400
come to a certain area and then just

694
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,520
take that avocado and put it into

695
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,038
and inoculate another soil bit and just

696
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,038
to go back on the the worms

697
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,319
for example you mentioned four different

698
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:57,759
types of worms right

699
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,599
somebody's brand new can they just get

700
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,798
away with just starting with red red

701
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,359
wigglers and just

702
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,480
doing that alone or what absolutely i

703
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,158
mean if they want to

704
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,759
kind of just experience this and again

705
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,280
it's you know pennies on the dollar you

706
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:10,879
want to see this for yourself

707
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:12,319
then the red wigglers are probably where

708
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,400
it's at because they're going to be the

709
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,399
hardiest worms

710
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,400
i personally have never had them escape

711
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,600
even in like a um

712
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,798
forgotten dusty basic past plastic bin

713
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,480
left in the corner

714
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:26,000
where uh some of the other ones because

715
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,960
they are larger

716
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,359
composting worms they're going to escape

717
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,120
that

718
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,199
when they when there's not a food source

719
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,119
anymore so that's one of the main things

720
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,679
again where i say focus on that fabric

721
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,000
pot

722
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,840
is because i've never had them escape

723
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,440
since i've been using fabric pots

724
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:43,839
okay so you touched on browns a little

725
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,360
bit i know from my understanding and

726
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:46,959
correct me if i'm wrong

727
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,399
they say that you should when you're

728
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,319
adding in inputs

729
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,600
have a balance of green and browns i've

730
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,240
heard 50 percent

731
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,119
as kind of the ratio of greens to browns

732
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,720
can you tell me

733
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,319
is that accurate and then also can you

734
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,200
give me some more examples of

735
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,240
greens and browns that people can add

736
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,080
absolutely

737
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,720
in my experience man i've noticed that

738
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,319
if i am just adding greens if i'm adding

739
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,038
something that is just greens

740
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:12,079
i'm going to have issues with that so

741
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,400
technically anytime

742
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,319
that i add greens i still add a little

743
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,400
bit of a filler of brown where

744
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:19,759
it's like newspaper or cardboard or

745
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,519
something like that

746
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,519
i just found from my own experience that

747
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,319
i have better success with that

748
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,279
i also don't feed the worm bins any kind

749
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:30,480
of like

750
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,759
real food or anything um i focus on like

751
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,440
i said that that food

752
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:34,798
chow that i was talking about and then

753
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,080
we um

754
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:40,639
we focus on also using lionhead rabbits

755
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:43,519
so we're using cold manures you can also

756
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,038
use alpaca manure that kind of stuff so

757
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:49,200
we're using cold composting

758
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,200
theory and with using the composting

759
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,480
worms and then we're also feeding with

760
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,240
cold manures as well

761
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,558
which is going to minimize for a new

762
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,679
farmer any kind of issues or

763
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:00,558
you know especially when you're

764
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,400
composting regular composting

765
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:03,599
sometimes you can get that you know if

766
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,280
you're not monitoring the

767
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,959
temperatures you can basically ruin

768
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,240
maybe a couple weeks to a couple months

769
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,759
worth of work

770
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,440
so that's very frustrating when you

771
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,359
first start out that's why i

772
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,200
you know anybody that's starting out

773
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,119
just composting in general that's why

774
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,360
i try to teach them how you start out

775
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,399
with vermicomposting because it's a lot

776
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,879
easier

777
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,480
and it's not as frustrating because

778
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,520
obviously they're not they're not making

779
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,558
mistakes

780
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,918
uh so again with the green manures we

781
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,079
really want to focus on

782
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,520
cover crops when we first started out i

783
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,720
felt like everybody was talking about

784
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:36,639
clovers

785
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,558
but we found that that attracts too many

786
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,799
bugs too many issues

787
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,599
so we use the dicondja which is

788
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:45,599
basically like

789
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:47,038
a um a cover crop of just plant material

790
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,839
right it's just kind of like protecting

791
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:49,519
the soil

792
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,678
again this is a shout out to a steve

793
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,918
cantwell of greenlife productions

794
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,120
he's really the the forefront of that

795
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,799
there are a lot of people

796
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,558
himself included that was talking about

797
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,798
always using a

798
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:01,599
clover a variety of different clovers

799
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:03,200
but

800
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,959
the new up-to-date version is that we're

801
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,679
gonna use that dicondra because it's not

802
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,759
going to

803
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,240
give us really any issues and there's

804
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,480
other ways to add nitrogen to the system

805
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,919
so we like to focus uh you know when

806
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,120
we're when we're building our worm bins

807
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,720
this is totally different than when

808
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,599
we're building our raised beds for

809
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,000
for other cultivation techniques uh so

810
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,079
um

811
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,919
you know usually some of the the plants

812
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,918
that i the medicinal plants that i like

813
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,240
you know we like to cultivate uh their

814
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,159
roots are actually going to go more of a

815
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,519
in a width pattern and they're going to

816
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,360
continue to go out

817
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,639
where when i'm focusing on building a

818
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,439
worm bins i want to use

819
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,880
dynamic accumulators i want those deeper

820
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,640
roots to go

821
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,960
deep down into that system especially if

822
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,880
i'm using 100 gallon or 200 gallon

823
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,720
fabric pot so it's a little bit

824
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,200
different uh you know if you're using a

825
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,200
20 gallon pot i don't think that dynamic

826
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,400
community accumulators are going to be

827
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,720
worthwhile

828
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,600
just because it's not really a bigger

829
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,558
deep enough

830
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:59,278
pot but if you are at the 100 200 gallon

831
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:00,879
ratio

832
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:02,720
that's where you get into like the

833
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,080
dandelions the chickweeds

834
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,480
uh the nettles uh the daikon radish

835
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,599
uh comfrey especially the bucking

836
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,278
comfrey

837
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:12,959
those are things that i feel like are

838
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:14,480
going to be game changers for you when

839
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,679
you start to see that

840
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,038
we are continuing to add diversity as we

841
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,559
build up these worm bins

842
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:23,119
and then of course anything that's

843
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,879
organic matter that soil food web is

844
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,119
going to break that down into

845
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,799
carbon and carbon is basically like the

846
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:29,278
currency if you will of the soil food

847
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:31,519
web

848
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,200
so the more exchanges that can go on

849
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:34,240
just the overall utopia that you're

850
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,120
trying to build

851
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,880
and i guess with greens to add with that

852
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,359
again coming back to like the avocado

853
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,600
tech

854
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,959
that's something else that i feel like

855
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:45,519
you know you want to make sure that

856
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,000
you're always adding organic avocados

857
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:48,798
and if you can i you know i like to we

858
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,880
have a

859
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,960
grocery store called sprouts here we

860
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,480
also have one name natural grocers

861
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,759
so you can go and talk to the produce

862
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,000
manager and say like hey what do you

863
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,319
guys

864
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,359
do with your organic avocados once

865
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,200
they've turned brown because that's

866
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:03,278
actually when you want to use those

867
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,720
um when you're using avocado tech and a

868
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:05,200
lot of those guys will sell them to you

869
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,798
for

870
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,720
you know maybe a quarter apiece maybe

871
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,319
less some of them will even give them to

872
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,319
you for free

873
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,000
the main stickler on that is again you

874
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,079
want to make sure that they're organic

875
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,240
and the way to always know that is the

876
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:20,558
the grocery stores will put a nine

877
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,000
before any other number as long as

878
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:23,839
organic so if you

879
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,599
walk into a grocery store and there's

880
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:26,240
avocados on the left and avocados on the

881
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:27,918
right

882
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,839
the one that has the nine before any

883
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,200
other numbers that's going to be your

884
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,879
organic choice

885
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,880
and i feel like as long as you maintain

886
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,919
that you're never going to add

887
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,400
potential issues to your soil system by

888
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,360
in my opinion going cheap

889
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,720
and it's really relatively inexpensive

890
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,359
you know when you're buying organic

891
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,079
avocados in general but for avocado tech

892
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:49,678
i think

893
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:51,759
if you're really trying to do it in the

894
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,360
right way you're trying to find avocados

895
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,278
that nobody was going to use

896
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,558
or you know your family uses it and then

897
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:57,119
you put it in there and that kind of

898
00:26:56,558 --> 00:26:58,720
thing

899
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,079
so let's get a little bit deeper into

900
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,200
avocado tech because i know a lot of my

901
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:02,720
viewers are

902
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,558
newer like i mentioned and a lot of

903
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,159
people thought avocado tech what's that

904
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,798
can you uh could you explain what that

905
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,400
is and how you actually do that

906
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:11,759
yeah well there's actually two versions

907
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,480
of it so i want to give credit where

908
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:14,480
credit's due

909
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,000
i feel like our little crew in denver

910
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,798
colorado we have

911
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,519
uh avocado tech 1.0 and then there's a

912
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:24,319
gentleman named blue of green tank

913
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:25,599
and in my opinion he created uh avocado

914
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,119
tech 2.0

915
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:30,079
so what i'm teaching you guys today is

916
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,599
the basic stuff avocado tech 1.0

917
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,678
and then i encourage you to go check him

918
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:35,439
out on instagram he also has

919
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,038
been on several podcasts where he

920
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,919
discusses kind of taking this to the

921
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:39,839
next level

922
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,440
and using a variety of different things

923
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:43,759
than just avocados

924
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,600
but the basic avocado tech is simple

925
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:48,798
you're going to take

926
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:51,678
a pretty close to starting to rot uh

927
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:52,558
avocado so that's nice and easy to

928
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,919
manipulate

929
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:55,678
you're going to kind of push that

930
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,520
together like a baked potato

931
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,880
and you're going to cut an x into it

932
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,440
like a baked potato

933
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,039
pop open so that you see the fleshy part

934
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,240
you're going to take that fleshy part

935
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:05,919
and you're going to then

936
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,519
take it down and shimmy it down into

937
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,600
your living soil system

938
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,200
now i don't recommend doing avocado tech

939
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:12,719
until your system has become

940
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,720
kind of alive it doesn't necessarily

941
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,200
have to be thriving but you definitely

942
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,440
want

943
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,880
uh you know when you pull back that soil

944
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,880
to see those worms

945
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,559
to see those springtails and once you

946
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,039
see that with the naked eye

947
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:26,879
then you can implement this system uh

948
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,720
the reason i say that is if you leave an

949
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,960
avocado out there and there's not enough

950
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,440
composting worms to devour that in time

951
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,120
it could potentially uh be a nuisance

952
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,919
add fungus gnats and stuff so again

953
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,319
there's a

954
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,120
kind of like a balance with this a

955
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:43,278
goldilocks approach of knowing

956
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,479
when to add the avocado and you know if

957
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:44,960
they're not breaking it down quick

958
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,599
enough

959
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,399
when to remove the avocado so in optimal

960
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:50,639
conditions

961
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,319
what's going to happen is the composting

962
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,000
worms are going to start to

963
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:55,918
crawl up into that avocado they're

964
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,240
excited by the fats

965
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,480
they be more and more begin to

966
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,480
accumulate within that avocado

967
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,038
and then they begin to touch each other

968
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,640
like i mentioned at the beginning of

969
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:08,158
composting worms are hermaphrodites

970
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,679
meaning they're male and female so all

971
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,240
they really have to do is touch each

972
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,080
other

973
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,319
and then it's brown cow brown chicken

974
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:16,079
brown caltime and the reason why that's

975
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,158
going to the next level is because we're

976
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,639
able to get those to kind of

977
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,240
consolidate in one little area and that

978
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,520
starts to build up the biofilm that

979
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,599
starts to build up uh

980
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,679
in my opinion the real secret sauce of

981
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:29,599
what living soil is

982
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,840
and that's getting back to mother nature

983
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:34,480
so once those avocado starts to

984
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:35,599
break down and build up you're going to

985
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,319
since they all

986
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:41,278
started to reproduce you're going to see

987
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,720
just a pocket of these little white

988
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:44,159
when you first see them you might think

989
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,120
it's like an outbreak of a

990
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,278
non-beneficial

991
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,239
but they're extremely tiny little white

992
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:50,000
worms

993
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,480
you'll see them start to kind of be

994
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,759
around the area where that avocado

995
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,000
once was if you do have enough of a

996
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:58,798
system that's you know it's it would

997
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,720
definitely have to be

998
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,879
probably a year or two in they will

999
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,360
break down that avocado pit as well

1000
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,120
if it's a newer system that's probably

1001
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,158
not going to happen so i usually will

1002
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,719
take those avocados

1003
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,919
out maybe smash them and then apply a

1004
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,839
top dressing

1005
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,120
now that's to get composting worms

1006
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:16,639
there's another version of this when

1007
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,719
we're trying to get orbital mites

1008
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,960
predatory mites we're trying to you know

1009
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,960
against spend pennies on the dollar for

1010
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,200
some of this stuff and so with that

1011
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,880
we're going to take the same avocado but

1012
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,600
instead of cutting it open like a baked

1013
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,520
potato

1014
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,038
we're going to cut that in half so now

1015
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,119
you have two halves of the

1016
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:35,200
avocado you're going to take that down

1017
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,719
again shimmy it down into that soil

1018
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,840
system and because it

1019
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,839
has more air more exposure the

1020
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,278
mites will actually take hold of that a

1021
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,918
lot faster than the

1022
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:47,759
composting worms so you will still get

1023
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,000
composting worms when you use the

1024
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,839
second method but it's not going to be

1025
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,200
that gumball effect that you're after so

1026
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,599
if you're really after building up the

1027
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,080
composting worms then that first baked

1028
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,278
baked potato style method that's the one

1029
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:00,720
that you're going to want to use

1030
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:03,278
and again that's going to work for red

1031
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,480
wigglers european night crawlers african

1032
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,480
night crawlers

1033
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,000
and the georgia alabama jumpers so it

1034
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,839
doesn't really necessarily matter

1035
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,519
and again this is going to build up the

1036
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:13,119
springtails the rogue beetles really

1037
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,359
everything that's involved this is kind

1038
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:17,839
of a little catalyst if you will

1039
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:19,599
to spark up that life and you can put

1040
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:21,519
these all over your soil systems or if

1041
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:22,879
you're in a larger commercial facility i

1042
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,839
mean you can put these all over your

1043
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,320
raised beds

1044
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,558
so that again if you're being proactive

1045
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:31,439
you might be able to take 2 000 worms

1046
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,519
and put them into each 4x4 bed

1047
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,480
that you yourself have farmed over these

1048
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,839
last three months

1049
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,360
and save the owner operators you know a

1050
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:40,558
ridiculous amount of money especially

1051
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:41,119
when you're first starting to get things

1052
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:43,119
up

1053
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:45,119
shipping the worms is extremely costly

1054
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:46,719
sometimes depending on where you are

1055
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:48,558
it costs more to ship the worms than it

1056
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,640
does the actual worms

1057
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:52,558
so that uh prohibits a lot of this kind

1058
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,000
of stuff and i encourage people to

1059
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:56,480
you know you want to go out of your way

1060
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,759
to be local i like peer-to-peer kind of

1061
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,440
stuff especially if you're working to

1062
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:01,679
try to get inoculants

1063
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,038
shout out to marco is growing that's

1064
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,798
another gentleman that i know that's

1065
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,798
going out of his way to not only teach

1066
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,879
about natural farming techniques

1067
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:11,359
but is continuing to now breed

1068
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,120
beneficials for the community as well

1069
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:16,000
because unfortunately for a lot of that

1070
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:18,558
stuff it's still extremely expensive

1071
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,159
for the larger cultivator to be able to

1072
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:22,158
farm with beneficials

1073
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,519
effectively let's get a little deeper

1074
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,480
into beneficials i think that's a great

1075
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,798
segue to it

1076
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,480
springtails rove beetles there's some

1077
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:30,079
beneficial insects and as you mentioned

1078
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,640
they're not known in your living soil

1079
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:32,240
but

1080
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,759
you're saying that they can be in your

1081
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,798
worm bin as well right so

1082
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:36,879
can you talk just a little bit about

1083
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:38,558
springtails rogue beetles kind of

1084
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,320
introduction to them and and how they're

1085
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:43,119
beneficial and so on and so forth

1086
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,398
absolutely so my first uh meeting with

1087
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:45,839
springtails is i really didn't

1088
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:48,319
understand what they were

1089
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:50,158
i started to water you know day after

1090
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:54,000
day week after week and i would notice

1091
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,679
after a while some of the fabric pots

1092
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,679
some of them had a little bit of that

1093
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,080
snow that started to pop up

1094
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,120
and then a lot of the ones uh would pop

1095
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:02,960
up and it looked like kind of like

1096
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,038
christmas morning over there

1097
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,960
so i went to google i started to find

1098
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:07,359
out what our springtail mites and i

1099
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,840
would

1100
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,199
i promise you the first probably two

1101
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:12,639
pages when you google that

1102
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,880
it's all about how to get rid of

1103
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,038
springtails that they are a nuisance

1104
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,039
so i personally freaked out i threw away

1105
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:21,919
genetics that to this day

1106
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:23,440
still kind of stinks not realizing that

1107
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,000
you know what i've really done is kind

1108
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,159
of over

1109
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,599
populated the springtails so again in

1110
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,080
moderation with things

1111
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,839
uh but there wasn't channels like yours

1112
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:33,199
you know there wasn't a mr grower where

1113
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,119
i could just sit here and

1114
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,440
take a few hours out of my day and

1115
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:38,239
really learn dialed in things on how to

1116
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,080
improve

1117
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,159
uh for us back then it was just on

1118
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:43,918
forums and sometimes you know

1119
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,600
take you know you ask a question back

1120
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,640
then it might take three four days for

1121
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,639
somebody to give you an

1122
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,240
answer uh so this is what's really cool

1123
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,919
about digital media and that kind of

1124
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,278
stuff and where it's taking is just

1125
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,360
information in general

1126
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:56,960
has gone through the roof and hats off

1127
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:58,798
to the younger

1128
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,960
younger guys the early 20 type

1129
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,558
individuals because i feel like they're

1130
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,000
going to really be the future and the

1131
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:05,918
voice of a

1132
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,679
living soil organic style movement

1133
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,280
because they understand it from a to z

1134
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,200
or at least they're starting to

1135
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,480
for sure yeah i know when i first came

1136
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,000
across springtails i was like what the

1137
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,440
heck are these how do i get rid of them

1138
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,719
you know and then realizing that they

1139
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,519
were beneficial

1140
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:21,598
from there um but you're not gonna see

1141
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:22,639
that that's that's the real issue is you

1142
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,320
gotta kind of uh

1143
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,720
already know to look for that

1144
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,359
information and again springtails are

1145
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,039
just uh

1146
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:30,559
organic decomposers they're just

1147
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:31,759
breaking down organic matter in

1148
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:33,519
conjunction

1149
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,800
in conjunction in a symbiotic

1150
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,119
relationship uh

1151
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,079
with your composting worms and then what

1152
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,919
i also like to

1153
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,079
use especially in worm bins are what's

1154
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,519
known as isopods or roly-polies

1155
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,280
they basically kind of do the same thing

1156
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:46,480
in springtails so those are two little

1157
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,839
extra things

1158
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,639
that you can have that are going to

1159
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:52,559
really maintain your worm populations by

1160
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,079
breaking down organic matter so that

1161
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,239
there's enough food there's no reason

1162
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,400
for those worms to escape

1163
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,759
and then again it's once that system

1164
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,760
becomes alive and thriving

1165
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,280
there's really not really there's not

1166
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,560
really that much you have to do to

1167
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,960
maintain the system

1168
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,719
other than feed it obviously watering

1169
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,559
the system and every now and then using

1170
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:12,399
maybe some avocado tech

1171
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,078
but the beneficials what you're really

1172
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,480
trying to do there is

1173
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,640
inoculate and inoculate for cheap

1174
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,719
especially with rove beetles

1175
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:23,279
i personally like to use praying mantis

1176
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,199
for the medicinal plants that i use

1177
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,880
the beauty of that is you can buy little

1178
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:30,000
egg sacs they usually come in

1179
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,599
you know two or four when you hatch

1180
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,239
those out it kind of becomes like an

1181
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:37,680
apple alpha battle royale

1182
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,879
so uh they'll be maybe 150 to 200 per

1183
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:40,960
egg sac

1184
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,480
they are going to basically start to eat

1185
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,838
each other battle each other

1186
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,159
the alphas will emerge the alphas that

1187
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:49,519
come out of that will start to feed on

1188
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,039
smaller insects

1189
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,639
at that time they're brown so they're

1190
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:55,039
working themselves

1191
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:55,759
finding things to eliminate in that soil

1192
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,239
system

1193
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,119
as they start to mature they'll turn

1194
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,479
pink

1195
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,000
and for a moment there while they're

1196
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,199
pink they're usually kind of the most

1197
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,719
vulnerable so they'll

1198
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:07,118
they'll also still be in the soil but

1199
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:09,279
they'll they'll start to

1200
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,960
get confidence to go up into the stock

1201
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,000
and as they become an adult that's when

1202
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,079
you'll see them either turn

1203
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,119
brown or green or at least the ones that

1204
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,039
i personally have

1205
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,160
used there's super fancy ones like

1206
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,920
orchid prang mantis but

1207
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:23,118
you know for money-wise that's

1208
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,639
definitely not something you'd be using

1209
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,880
in your garden

1210
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,239
but you know your basic praying mantis

1211
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,160
once that turns green

1212
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:31,759
uh they're kind of like watch dogs if

1213
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:33,920
you will and so as long as they don't

1214
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,119
get too close to each other

1215
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,559
if they do get too close you can

1216
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,119
literally pick them up and then just set

1217
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:39,119
them on

1218
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,358
another plant on the other side of the

1219
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,320
garden other side of the room

1220
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:45,039
and just keep things moving along the

1221
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,200
the one

1222
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:50,000
thing that i will say i used to help

1223
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:52,639
keep them alive by using ladybugs

1224
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,559
and i want to kind of set the tone for

1225
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:56,078
that is ladybugs all of the ones that

1226
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:58,159
you purchase at a garden center

1227
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,200
those have all come from wild crafted

1228
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:02,399
areas

1229
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:03,919
so they also carry vectors and disease

1230
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,280
and kind of that kind of stuff and you

1231
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,800
it's not really what you think about at

1232
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,079
first you think the ladybug is going to

1233
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,839
be beneficial

1234
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,359
but the reality is that you want to use

1235
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:13,679
green lacewings

1236
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:15,759
so all of us now that are cultivating

1237
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:16,399
using beneficials focused on living soil

1238
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,320
systems

1239
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,880
we personally don't even use ladybugs

1240
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,079
anymore so using a praying mantis again

1241
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,680
you're going to have to use

1242
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,760
probably something else to keep them

1243
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:26,559
alive if you don't have major pest

1244
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,800
issues

1245
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,078
so maybe like a minute pirate bug or an

1246
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,599
assassin bug

1247
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,039
they will still kind of eat that so you

1248
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,720
need to make sure that there's something

1249
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,960
for the praying mantis to eat

1250
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,838
because they will grow to a pretty large

1251
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,800
length and

1252
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,519
uh if if environment is well enough i've

1253
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,400
had them

1254
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:44,719
me personally live up to a year so again

1255
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,960
it's

1256
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:47,919
it's something that is pennies on the

1257
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,800
dollar

1258
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,400
for a up and up-and-coming farmer wow

1259
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
yeah that's fascinating that's really

1260
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,000
cool

1261
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,519
and we're just kind of scratching the

1262
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,440
surface here with the beneficial insects

1263
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:57,920
i mean we would go on and on and on and

1264
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,519
on

1265
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,358
probably i'd do it a whole dedicated

1266
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,519
episode to that that would be

1267
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:05,039
awesome but yeah that that's really cool

1268
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:06,880
that's that's cool that it's not only in

1269
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,719
like living soil but also it's

1270
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,400
fine if it's in your worm bins as well

1271
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,519
it's just something that i learned today

1272
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,440
so i didn't realize that

1273
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,039
that was okay i thought it would just be

1274
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,320
worms breaking it down and

1275
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:17,920
you know obviously the microbes and

1276
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,359
stuff like that but having all these

1277
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,039
other beneficials in there

1278
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:23,279
there's no harm in that so that's that's

1279
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:23,920
pretty cool diversity is what's going to

1280
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,240
keep

1281
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,039
your soil system alive and healthy

1282
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,358
whether that's

1283
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:31,199
in the soil system or you know the the

1284
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:33,679
beneficials that are protecting

1285
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:34,799
the plant material and again real quick

1286
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:36,639
there's something that was called the

1287
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,240
hypeosis miles when i

1288
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:41,039
first started out i believe they changed

1289
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:43,279
it now to what's known as the skidimus

1290
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:44,559
predatory mite but if you add that to

1291
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,400
your soil system

1292
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:47,759
it's relatively cheap and especially if

1293
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,920
you're proactive let's say you

1294
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,680
you added it a couple months uh before

1295
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,200
you really started farming

1296
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:55,118
that is something that is extremely

1297
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,519
beneficial uh and

1298
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,519
in my opinion something that is tried

1299
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:00,000
and true for making sure that you don't

1300
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:02,400
have

1301
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,239
a pest and disease and with the good

1302
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,160
also sometimes come with the bad right

1303
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:08,000
fungus gnats are one of those things

1304
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:09,838
that i think are pretty common when it

1305
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,358
comes to like worm bins

1306
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:13,279
you mentioned diversity is going to help

1307
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:14,719
definitely help with the uh the fungus

1308
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,079
gnat situation

1309
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:19,439
they thrive in wet mediums right and

1310
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,280
correct me if i'm wrong but you're going

1311
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,519
to need to have moisture

1312
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,960
in your bin at all times so that's where

1313
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:25,838
the fungus and that's kind of come into

1314
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,119
play

1315
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:31,440
now that being a challenge what are some

1316
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,838
of the things you can do to combat them

1317
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,960
uh well one of the main issues coming

1318
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:37,358
from fungus gnats

1319
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,440
is that you're probably over watering

1320
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:42,159
there's there's saturation there's

1321
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,200
issues with compaction again that's

1322
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:44,879
another reason why

1323
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:47,039
you know you go out of your way to use

1324
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,880
the four horsemen of composting worms so

1325
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,400
that there's always dissolved oxygen

1326
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,160
channels being built

1327
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,160
but let's say that you do have a major

1328
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:55,440
issue you have fungus gnats

1329
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,679
so the first thing you want to kind of

1330
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,960
do is well actually when you're starting

1331
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:00,480
up you will always want to have the

1332
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,880
yellow sticky traps

1333
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,559
that is not to kill fungus gnats that is

1334
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,880
literally just to start to

1335
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:08,719
monitor so if you start to see fungus

1336
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,880
gnats in one area of your

1337
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:12,239
operation then you know that that needs

1338
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,240
to be handled

1339
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:15,919
so the sticky traps kind of are the

1340
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:17,039
canary in the coal mine but that's

1341
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,280
definitely not a

1342
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:21,119
a way to eradicate like i had mentioned

1343
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,640
everything is about being proactive with

1344
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,160
the living soil system

1345
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:26,159
so again there's that goldilocks

1346
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:26,879
approach we have to keep a living soil

1347
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:29,199
system

1348
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,240
uh with a little bit more moisture than

1349
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:32,639
you know the average

1350
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:33,679
uh farmer that's used to using

1351
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,078
synthetics

1352
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:37,440
so how do we especially when i was first

1353
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,200
crossing over

1354
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,039
i was making a lot of mistakes i

1355
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,239
obviously was over watering i was over

1356
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:43,358
feeding that's why i had the

1357
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,598
you know christmas morning of

1358
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:47,279
springtails i definitely had fungus

1359
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,960
gnats for probably two years when i

1360
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,280
first started doing this stuff

1361
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,039
and it's because i didn't know about uh

1362
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,240
you know the schedule is hypiosis miles

1363
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:56,400
or the rove beetle

1364
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,078
uh the fact that you could use basically

1365
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,358
mother nature to combat mother nature

1366
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,079
when things start to

1367
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:03,679
to pop off and again the fungus not

1368
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,200
isn't necessarily anything that's going

1369
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:07,199
to

1370
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:08,318
unless it gets out of control it's it's

1371
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,239
more of a vector

1372
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:11,440
it's more of a nuisance so we want to

1373
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:13,598
make sure that we just

1374
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,440
don't have that issue and that's why i

1375
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,359
encourage you guys as warm farmers

1376
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,119
i know it sounds great to recycle your

1377
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:20,960
vegetables and and your fruits and all

1378
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,318
that kind of stuff but if you are new to

1379
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,000
this more than likely

1380
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:25,838
that is where your fungus net issues are

1381
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,199
going to come from is that you're over

1382
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:30,639
feeding your worm bins

1383
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:31,279
uh and then that's overfeeding your worm

1384
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,000
bins is

1385
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,440
probably always going to happen for a

1386
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,159
new worm farmer

1387
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,679
so why even take that issue why create

1388
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:42,159
that

1389
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:43,440
environment basically a utopia for

1390
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:46,838
fungus gnats is

1391
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,039
overfed an over watered soil medium

1392
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:50,400
gotcha one of the things that you

1393
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,079
incorporate

1394
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,000
you know in worm bins you touched on

1395
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,760
earlier is rabbits

1396
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,920
can you talk to us about the lionhead

1397
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,319
rabbit absolutely so

1398
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,200
um i've raised a variety of different

1399
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,880
rabbits

1400
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,719
and you know the goal at the end of the

1401
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,480
day was trying to get them to pee

1402
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:08,480
and poop in the worm bin so you could

1403
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,240
have more of a closed-loop system

1404
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,039
so i started off with dwarf white

1405
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:16,159
rabbits i would have a couple of them

1406
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:19,199
and i could never potty train them so

1407
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:21,358
we built like a little cage above the

1408
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:22,719
the worm bins and so they would eat and

1409
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:25,199
then when they would poop it would kind

1410
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:27,679
of fall down into the worm bins

1411
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:28,399
but if i personally didn't really like

1412
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,519
that i

1413
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,200
i like to um interact with the animals

1414
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:33,920
uh you know i have children that kind of

1415
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:36,239
stuff so

1416
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,280
it just never felt like the right way so

1417
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:39,598
i tried to

1418
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,319
start to research and find other uh

1419
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,680
rabbits that

1420
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:43,838
potentially could be a little bit

1421
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:46,000
smarter and to my surprise there's a

1422
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:47,039
rabbit that's called a lionhead rabbit i

1423
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,079
actually have it right here i want to

1424
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:51,279
show you guys

1425
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:54,480
so this rabbit is extremely intelligent

1426
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,119
you can potty train this rabbit so

1427
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,719
he's allowed to go up and down my house

1428
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,280
as he pleases just like a

1429
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:02,480
well-trained dog he goes all the way up

1430
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,880
to my bedroom my

1431
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,559
kid's bedroom down into the basement and

1432
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,640
he knows to poop and pee

1433
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:13,519
in the worm bin so i have probably 15

1434
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:14,078
100 gallon worm bins down in my basement

1435
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:16,400
i

1436
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,079
would imagine that's helped trained him

1437
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,880
to potty train him

1438
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,079
but having more than one seem to have

1439
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,720
that process

1440
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,680
extremely quick and now he's able to run

1441
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:28,239
around

1442
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,838
as he pleases go around poop as he

1443
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:31,118
pleases i make sure that i'm feeding

1444
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:32,559
organic food

1445
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,960
and then when he's pooping into those

1446
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:36,719
worm bins those worms are

1447
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,119
like the night crawlers are coming up at

1448
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:41,358
night to feed so again they're coming up

1449
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,720
they're feeding on organic matter

1450
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:44,799
they're feeding on

1451
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:46,559
his name is rick ross the real red cross

1452
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,039
so he's

1453
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,719
feeding on his uh manure and then

1454
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:53,519
they're coming back down

1455
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:54,239
and basically you know kind of starting

1456
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:56,800
to build

1457
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,318
a real subway system if you will for all

1458
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,839
of those composting worms and once it

1459
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:00,559
seems like they understand that there

1460
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:02,880
are

1461
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:04,880
uh rabbit manure droppings at the top

1462
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,720
everything just really starts to flow

1463
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,200
and again this is a cold manure so if

1464
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:10,879
you're a smaller farmer

1465
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:13,039
this rabbit might cost you a hundred

1466
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,920
bucks he's going to live for like four

1467
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:15,679
or five years

1468
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,358
and i assure you if you're a smaller

1469
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:18,480
farmer you only need one of these little

1470
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:20,960
guys

1471
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,358
and you know he's a family pet you know

1472
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,720
my children hang out with him like

1473
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:26,239
when they're playing minecraft and that

1474
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:27,679
kind of thing he'll just sit next to him

1475
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,639
and they'll hit they'll pet him and that

1476
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:31,440
kind of stuff so

1477
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:33,039
again if you go out of your way to

1478
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,960
research a few things

1479
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,639
it really is cool to see nature as long

1480
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,240
as you have an animal that's

1481
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:40,239
intelligent enough to kind of make the

1482
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:41,759
system work that's where i feel like

1483
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:43,039
even in like an apartment if you lived

1484
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,640
in an apartment you could still kind of

1485
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:47,679
have a closed-loop

1486
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:49,519
worm bin and system if you had one

1487
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:51,598
little bunny that you potty trained and

1488
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:53,759
a few pots and that kind of stuff

1489
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,838
so again it's it's you know going out of

1490
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,720
your way to to think about things and

1491
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:59,440
find ways

1492
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:01,358
uh to be more closed loop even if you

1493
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,000
are a tent farmer or a basement farmer

1494
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:03,358
or you're just

1495
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,358
kind of growing at your backyard and

1496
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:06,000
that kind of thing what are ways to

1497
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:07,759
minimize

1498
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,838
cost because when we first started

1499
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,440
farming it that that part never mattered

1500
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:13,920
how much it cost to

1501
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,280
to farm the material it was just more

1502
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,440
what was the price

1503
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,040
at the end of the day well the reality

1504
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,280
now is it's all about quality

1505
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:22,318
it's all about medicine regardless of

1506
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,280
your growing

1507
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,079
tomatoes or other plants you know you

1508
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,800
want new

1509
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,839
medicinal value also in your your fruits

1510
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,920
and your vegetables

1511
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:32,960
i feel like that's the reason why today

1512
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,838
you know

1513
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,599
just human beings in general uh seem

1514
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:38,719
incredibly pissed off and i feel like

1515
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,640
this because a lot of us

1516
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:42,480
are are suffering probably myself

1517
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:44,400
included are suffering from a variety of

1518
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,400
different um

1519
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,680
deficiencies just like just like our

1520
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,760
plants

1521
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:51,199
kind of went on a tangent there but you

1522
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,839
know i first when i first started to

1523
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:53,679
notice

1524
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:55,519
the overall health of using a living

1525
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:56,078
soil system i started to get the praying

1526
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,400
leaves

1527
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:59,599
on the plants that i was growing i was

1528
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,318
using kefir

1529
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,119
using other calcium sources that's when

1530
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:04,880
i started to

1531
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,559
find out about kombucha's that's when i

1532
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,079
started to use kefir

1533
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:10,159
so again i want you guys to encourage

1534
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,200
again your you know you're building that

1535
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:13,598
soil system

1536
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,199
focus it as a stomach and once you see

1537
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,960
how healthy that becomes

1538
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:18,480
i encourage you guys to maybe start

1539
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,240
drinking kefir in the morning or have a

1540
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,079
kombucha over a soda and start to see

1541
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:24,078
your overall gut health

1542
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,519
i could get you know we can get deeper

1543
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,200
into that at some point as well but

1544
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:29,119
there's something called autophagy

1545
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:30,639
where basically your body is going to be

1546
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,200
able to eat itself

1547
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:34,799
break down those old folded proteins and

1548
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:37,358
if you understand that process

1549
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,280
i assure you your life will change if

1550
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:41,598
you have gut issues if you just have

1551
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,119
brain fog i personally had those issues

1552
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:46,160
when i was a young man

1553
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,559
and now understanding these things i not

1554
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:48,000
a

1555
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:49,920
you know once you understand that it's a

1556
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,039
stomach whether it's in the soil system

1557
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,680
or right here

1558
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:55,358
uh your life can change dramatically in

1559
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:58,239
your farming and just your overall

1560
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,920
health in general wow that's that's very

1561
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:01,519
interesting stuff there for sure

1562
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,119
now let me ask you with a rabbit this is

1563
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:05,119
a podcast platform as well

1564
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,440
apple podcast spotify so they didn't get

1565
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,720
to see that cute rabbit that you just

1566
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,159
adorable by the way but um also

1567
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:13,919
what i was going to ask is do you have

1568
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:16,000
any pets along with it like i was

1569
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,599
wondering how does it interact with dogs

1570
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,280
cats because you said that rabbit's kind

1571
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,318
of roaming your house

1572
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,319
so no i don't have any cats or dogs

1573
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:26,079
you know there would probably be an

1574
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:27,519
issue with most dogs

1575
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,200
unless you kind of have like a golden

1576
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:31,280
retriever or something like that

1577
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:32,239
i've seen that kind of work out uh so

1578
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,760
yeah this would be

1579
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:35,759
more if you're trying to figure things

1580
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,119
out uh i can put him downstairs in the

1581
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,880
basement and he can

1582
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,480
you know has he basically has his own

1583
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,240
little utopia so you could set it up

1584
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,159
that way instead of letting him roam up

1585
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:45,439
through the house the the reality is i

1586
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:48,000
let him roam through the house

1587
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,639
uh because my children enjoy it so he

1588
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,199
can kind of

1589
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:52,799
and you know these especially a lionhead

1590
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:55,039
because they are so intelligent

1591
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,240
they are social creatures so they want

1592
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:58,400
to interact with you you

1593
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:00,159
they want you to pet them you know i we

1594
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,280
feed them a variety of things i mean

1595
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:02,960
it's not just

1596
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,559
uh hay or something like that he eats

1597
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,400
organic

1598
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:11,760
bok choy um carrots cucumbers

1599
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:14,480
i mean you name it radishes so that

1600
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,119
we can get that um complete basically

1601
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,838
trying to

1602
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,440
create that complete manure so that the

1603
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:22,318
worms break that down and again

1604
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,159
now we have a complete worm casting and

1605
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:25,119
again that's the inoculant that's not

1606
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:27,358
your

1607
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,039
soil system if you just grew in worm

1608
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:30,239
castings i assure you that your plants

1609
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:33,599
would suffer

1610
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:35,439
this is a a less is more type thing you

1611
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,880
know a little goes a long way with this

1612
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,440
and so when you do have

1613
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,559
just 20 30 40 pounds of this stuff as a

1614
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,000
smaller time farmer

1615
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,440
pass yourself on the back you know

1616
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,280
there's really no reason especially if

1617
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,639
you're building up living soil systems

1618
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,720
uh why you're going to have to go back

1619
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:50,318
to that hydroponics store

1620
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:51,838
you're now going to be able to go to the

1621
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:54,159
grocery store and

1622
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:56,078
and know specific nutrients that that

1623
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:58,879
your soil system needs

1624
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,079
makes sense that's really cool all right

1625
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,119
i do want to flip it back

1626
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,800
to something you talked about you

1627
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,240
touched up about it a little bit which

1628
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,599
is cover crops

1629
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:07,679
now i didn't know you could have cover

1630
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,760
crops in warm bins

1631
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:11,598
that makes me wonder you know lighting

1632
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,720
as well if the cover crops will be grown

1633
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,920
there's gonna be some sort of lighting

1634
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:15,838
can you talk about

1635
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,280
cover crops and worm bins and like the

1636
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:17,838
lighting requirements and so on and so

1637
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,079
forth

1638
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:22,318
yeah i would say there's probably not a

1639
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,119
lot of people that use worm bins with a

1640
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:24,880
cover crop

1641
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,960
the most people that i see are using

1642
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:30,000
like again those plastic tubs

1643
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:33,760
or like a burlap sap

1644
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,760
sack uh newspaper that kind of stuff

1645
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,920
but the reality is is that you're trying

1646
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,400
to build that rhizosphere whether i'm

1647
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,240
building a worm bin or i'm building a

1648
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,760
soil system in my raised beds

1649
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:45,358
i'm trying to just get everything to

1650
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,400
become alive and thriving

1651
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:51,838
and so i need the roots to kind of

1652
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:54,000
make sure that everything takes care of

1653
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:54,960
itself especially with what's known as

1654
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,119
exudates

1655
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,000
so when we build up that root system

1656
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,119
they're going to start

1657
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,159
to communicate with the soil microbes on

1658
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,119
what is needed

1659
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:05,759
jeff lowenfeld's makes a a great example

1660
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,680
of this for

1661
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,119
someone that's new to this is it's like

1662
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:11,039
your plants being able to say all right

1663
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,559
tonight i would love to have a burger

1664
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:14,239
but you know what tomorrow night i'd

1665
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:16,480
love to have chinese food

1666
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:17,759
or you know if it's more of like a you

1667
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,358
understand farming it's more

1668
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,960
hey i need a little bit more of nitrogen

1669
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:22,639
i need a little more potassium i need a

1670
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,960
little bit more

1671
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:27,039
phosphorous calcium and so the plant

1672
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,800
never has deficiencies whatsoever when

1673
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:30,639
you're using a living soil system

1674
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,318
and in my opinion man when we say living

1675
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:34,719
soil system what we're really saying is

1676
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:38,400
we're trying to grow with mother nature

1677
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:39,118
indoors and since we um most of us are

1678
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,318
forced to

1679
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:44,480
cultivate indoors how do we

1680
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:45,599
you know optimize that in the best way

1681
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,039
that we can

1682
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,800
and that's why i think living soil

1683
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:51,920
systems are the future for

1684
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,200
farming regardless is because it's using

1685
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,358
mother nature

1686
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:56,318
to create that as well as using mother

1687
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:58,400
nature to combat

1688
00:50:56,318 --> 00:50:59,519
pest issues and the overall health of

1689
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,119
your plant

1690
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:02,719
there is an old school saying that you

1691
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:05,358
know brix levels

1692
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:06,639
for some some people believe that 12

1693
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:08,719
percent or higher

1694
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:10,639
sucking incense won't recognize that

1695
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:12,558
that uh plant as food

1696
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:14,159
i i don't know if you know those

1697
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,559
percentages are exact but i

1698
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:17,920
do know that if your garden is healthy

1699
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:19,680
and there's almost you know the praying

1700
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,000
leaves there's almost like this ah

1701
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,799
when you first walk into your room you

1702
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,358
are going to

1703
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,880
hardly have any pest issues whatsoever

1704
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:28,960
interesting yeah good stuff there

1705
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,160
okay so starting from the beginning we

1706
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,519
you know we talked about containers we

1707
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:33,920
talked about the size

1708
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:35,519
what to add in there to begin worms

1709
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,559
beneficials we went through all that

1710
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:38,400
stuff

1711
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,920
now say somebody has all that stuff set

1712
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,400
up right what's

1713
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,920
like what's day-to-day tasks that they

1714
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,358
do right so you wake up in the morning

1715
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,440
you walk into your worm bin

1716
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:49,358
what's like a maintenance types task

1717
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,280
that you do on a day-to-day basis

1718
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:53,759
this is extremely low maintenance so

1719
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,519
again you know my focus would be to

1720
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,520
build up that cover crop

1721
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:59,199
and once you have a cover crop that's

1722
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:01,440
going to kind of

1723
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:03,679
protect that soil system but as well

1724
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,159
kind of manage and regulate things

1725
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:07,199
the reason why you never see you know

1726
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:09,838
unless man has

1727
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:11,358
intervened there's no bare soil in

1728
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,519
nature and the reason for that is

1729
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:15,199
anytime you start to see weeds it's just

1730
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:17,199
trying mother nature's just trying to go

1731
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,039
through that progression that cycle

1732
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:20,879
so you know on the left hand side

1733
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:22,639
usually when you look at charts it talks

1734
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,119
about like very basic things

1735
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,078
very beginning big bacteria that's

1736
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,280
starting to form

1737
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,800
and then as you go through the

1738
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,920
progression and you get to more of the

1739
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,960
old growth forest

1740
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,760
that's where you'll see higher uh

1741
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,400
bacteria to fungal ratios and so i feel

1742
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,319
like

1743
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,039
uh if you're really trying to grow

1744
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:42,800
medicine you need to have a balance of

1745
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:44,400
that as well so you need to have the

1746
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,720
bacteria and you do need to have the

1747
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,000
fungal aspects so that's why we're going

1748
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,399
to add those

1749
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,838
inputs but also grow the cover crop

1750
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,559
because it kind of just protects

1751
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:54,318
everything

1752
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,400
you can chop and drop if things get out

1753
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:58,239
of control like i said you can use a

1754
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,000
lionhead rabbit that will come and munch

1755
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:03,439
all of that cover crop that's starting

1756
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,358
to come over your bins i assure you one

1757
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,920
rabbit will mow down almost anything

1758
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:08,558
that

1759
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,760
you're trying to cultivate on a cover

1760
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,160
crop basis

1761
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,119
so i'm constantly reapplying seed

1762
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,239
because

1763
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:19,119
mr ross over there is is mowing it down

1764
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:20,959
but he's providing such a valuable uh

1765
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:24,318
fertilizer and cold manure

1766
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,760
cold fertilizer uh that it's worth it to

1767
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:28,639
me to spend you know

1768
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,359
maybe five ten bucks and seed every few

1769
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:32,078
months

1770
00:53:29,358 --> 00:53:34,318
uh to to make sure that that process is

1771
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:37,440
as closed looped as it could be for

1772
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:39,679
you know where we are and um and

1773
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,960
in a home environment well we have gone

1774
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:44,239
over quite a bit

1775
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,318
in this episode i think it is jam-packed

1776
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:48,318
full of good information so wrapping

1777
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:49,279
things up how can listeners find you

1778
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:52,318
and what do you have upcoming in the

1779
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,119
future yeah so um you know on instagram

1780
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:55,358
i've

1781
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:57,280
gone out of my way like you have mr

1782
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:57,598
growit and i try to educate you know

1783
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,519

1784
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,800
one of the main things that uh we've

1785
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:02,960
been doing we

1786
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,800
we had live events in denver colorado

1787
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,559
before anybody would ever

1788
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,880
really give living soil guys the time of

1789
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:10,240
day um and where it's progressed is now

1790
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,519
we're on instagram so

1791
