1
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,800
hey what's up everybody welcome back to

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,879
my channel picked up this seed cleaning

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,719
machine not too long ago some people

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,480
call it a seed sorter and figured i'd

5
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:18,079
make a quick video showing you how it

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,000
works it's actually a few different seed

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,679
cleaning machines that you can find if

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,839
you search the internet this is a larger

9
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,679
design it's about three feet tall and

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,599
that works really well but i think i'd

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,320
go for the more compact one so here's

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,119
what it looks like it is pretty small in

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,558
size the dimensions are 18 inches wide

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,039
12 inches tall

15
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,919
and nearly 6 inches deep and i have it

16
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,600
just resting on two 5 gallon buckets so

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,359
pretty convenient basically the seeds

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,120
will be sorted into one bucket and the

19
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,799
plant material will be sorted into the

20
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,718
other bucket the plant material does

21
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,119
need to be very dry and completely

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,800
crumbled up so seed should be separated

23
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,000
from the plant material not really

24
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,679
connected to it because you're going to

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,159
place it in the machine it's going to go

26
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,399
down into the machine and the fan is

27
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,558
actually going to blow it from the left

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,920
up and over that'll be the light plant

29
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:05,679
material that goes into the bucket on

30
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,760
the right and then seeds are heavier

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,520
they're dropped down on the left the fan

32
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,600
that's connected to this is an ac

33
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,280
infinity fan just connected to my wall

34
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,199
outlet it's my first time ever using

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,759
this seed cleaning machine so i'm going

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,759
to start out by using it at medium speed

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,159
now different plants have different size

38
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,319
and weight of seeds so depending on what

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,920
seed you're working with you will adjust

40
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,239
the speed with the variable speed

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,040
controller okay so here i have my plant

42
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,959
material it's all broken up the best i

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,118
can i've got this little piece of wood

44
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,959
here it's actually a skewer just so i

45
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,959
can push the play material down if

46
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,199
needed and here i go i'm emptying the

47
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,039
plant material into the machine

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,680
and you can see the lighter plant

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,439
material is actually being blown up over

50
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,040
and into the bucket on the right and

51
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,359
then the heavier seeds are actually

52
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,479
dropping down into the left bucket all

53
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,679
right so i ran everything through you

54
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,759
can see some of the plant material is

55
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,439
actually blown out didn't actually go

56
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,879
all the way down it was stuck there

57
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,478
because it's so light the wind was just

58
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,158
kind of pushing it outwards looks like

59
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,920
we have one area here where seeds were

60
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,600
stuck so this design is certainly not

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,920
perfect all right removing the seed

62
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,758
cleaning machine here is what the bucket

63
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,199
on the right looks like the bucket with

64
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,878
the plant material and you can see a

65
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,878
whole bunch of underdeveloped seeds

66
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,280
and then the bucket on the left has all

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,680
of the good seeds well should be good

68
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,479
seeds i'm sure it's not perfect but you

69
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,239
can see a majority of the seeds are nice

70
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,000
and dark and there's a high chance that

71
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,520
they are viable just for testing

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,519
purposes i am going to take the bucket

73
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,519
on the right with the plant material and

74
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,360
all the underdeveloped seeds break it up

75
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,959
a little bit more with my hand i'm

76
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,200
actually going to dump it out onto a

77
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,479
screen and then break it up with my hand

78
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,159
i'm going to run it through the machine

79
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,238
one more time and i'm going to see if

80
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,560
there's any developed seeds that went

81
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,039
ahead and got launched over to the wrong

82
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,560
bucket okay so i ran it through again

83
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:54,079
you see the plant material in this

84
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,439
bucket and then the seeds in this bucket

85
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,599
looks like there are some clearly

86
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,039
developed seeds i know the color is

87
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,199
going to be real tricky so you can't

88
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,039
fully say it's underdeveloped just by

89
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,199
looking at its color some seeds may

90
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:07,280
still be like a gray color but still be

91
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,359
viable yeah i poured it out onto my

92
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,439
screen and just separated the remaining

93
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,599
ones by hand overall this machine is

94
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,959
going to save me a ton of time it

95
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,878
actually already did save me a ton of

96
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,680
time i could have been sorting this by

97
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,439
hand for hours i decided to invest into

98
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,120
this machine i'd love to know your

99
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,719
thoughts on this let me know down in the

100
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,080
comment section below if you're new to

101
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,479
my channel i would love to have you

102
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,560
subscribe this is my garden talk channel

103
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,399
i have my garden talk podcast on here

104
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,039
that is every single week sometimes i'll

105
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,879
do q a videos those get scattered on my

106
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,239
channel as i have time and every once

107
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,000
while there'll be a topic video that

108
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,000
shows up on this channel as well on the

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,239
outro card here the video on the left is

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,759
one of my recent q a videos and the

111
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,599
video on the right is automatically

112
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,280
generated by the youtube algorithm

113
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:53,119
thanks for tuning in everyone and i will

114
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,120
catch you in the next episode
